abstract = {The relation of two well-known ancient carbonate deposits to hydrocarbon seepage was confirmed by this study. Archaea are found to be associated with the formation of Oxfordian seep carbonates from Beauvoisin and with a Miocene limestone from Marmorito ("tube-worm limestone"). Carbonates formed due to a mediation by archaea exhibit extremely positive or extremely negative delta(13)C(carbonate) values, respectively. Highly positive values (+15 parts per thousand) reflect the use of C- 13-enriched CO2 produced by methanogenesis. Low delta(13)C values of the Marmorito carbonates (-30 parts per thousand) indicate the oxidation of seepage-derived hydrocarbons. Likewise, the delta(13)C content of specific tail-to-tail linked isoprenoids, biomarkers for archaea, was found to be strikingly depleted in these samples (as low as -115 parts per thousand). The isotopic signatures corroborate that archaea were involved in the cycling of seepage-derived organic carbon at the ancient localities, Another Miocene limestone ("Marmorito limestone") shows a strong imprint of methanotrophic bacteria as indicated by delta(13)C values of carbonate as low as -40 parts per thousand and biomarker evidence. Epifluorescence microscopy and field-emission scanning electron microscopy revealed that bacterial biofilms were involved in carbonate aggregation. In addition to lucinid bivalves previously reported from both localities, we infer that sponges from Beauvoisin and tube worms from Marmorito depended on chemosynthesis as well. Low delta(13)C values of nodules related to sponge taphonomy (-27 parts per thousand) indicate that sponges might have been linked to an enhanced hydrocarbon oxidation. Tube worm fossils from Marmorito closely resemble chemosynthetic pogonophoran tube worms from Recent cold seeps and are embedded in isotopically light carbonate (delta(13)C -30 parts per thousand).},

abstract = {Correlation of stratigraphic sections from different continents suggests a worldwide interruption of carbonate sedimentation at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, which coincided with one of the most catastrophic mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic. Both events are linked by a vulcanogenic maximum of carbon dioxide, which led to a temporary undersaturation of sea water with respect to aragonite and calcite and a corresponding suppression of carbonate sedimentation including nonpreservation of calcareous skeletons. Besides the frequently cited climatic effect of enhanced carbon dioxide, lowering the saturation state of sea water with respect to calcium carbonate was an additional driving force of the end-Triassic mass extinction, which chiefly affected organisms with thick aragonitic or high-magnesium calcitic skeletons. Replacement of aragonite by calcite, as found in the shells of epifaunal bivalves, was an evolutionary response to this condition.},

abstract = {The 3,430-million-year-old Strelley Pool Chert (SPC) (Pilbara Craton, Australia) is a sedimentary rock formation containing laminated structures of probable biological origin (stromatolites). Determining the biogenicity of such ancient fossils is the subject of ongoing debate. However, many obstacles to interpretation of the fossils are overcome in the SPC because of the broad extent, excellent preservation and morphological variety of its stromatolitic outcrops--which provide comprehensive palaeontological information on a scale exceeding other rocks of such age. Here we present a multi-kilometre-scale palaeontological and palaeoenvironmental study of the SPC, in which we identify seven stromatolite morphotypes--many previously undiscovered--in different parts of a peritidal carbonate platform. We undertake the first morphotype-specific analysis of the structures within their palaeoenvironment and refute contemporary abiogenic hypotheses for their formation. Finally, we argue that the diversity, complexity and environmental associations of the stromatolites describe patterns that--in similar settings throughout Earth's history--reflect the presence of organisms.},

abstract = {Pliocene-Quaternary sapropels of the Mediterranean Sea and mid-Cretaceous black shales share many distinctive properties. Organic carbon concentrations that often exceed 5{\%} in both types of sequences record episodes of exceptional accumulation of organic matter. Although both are rich in marine organic matter, they have high C/N ratios that mimic those of land-plant organic matter, which suggests less-efficient organic matter recycling than in the modem ocean. The coupled presence of isorenieratene derivatives and low delta N-15 values that result from microbial primary productivity indicates that photic zone anoxia existed during their formation and implies strong stratification of the surface ocean. Enrichments of redox-sensitive metals and sediment laminations indicate that anoxia existed deeper in the water column and at the seafloor. Multiple proxies indicate freshening of surface waters of the Mediterranean and imply periods of wetter climate during times of sapropel deposition. Episodes of black shale deposition similarly coincide with times of wetter climate. These comparisons suggest that the wetter climate created similar conditions of surface salinity stratification that enhanced microbial primary production and magnified organic matter export during deposition of both the Mediterranean sapropels and mid-Cretaceous black shales.

abstract = {The famous Permian-Triassic boundary section at Guryul Ravine in Kashmir shows repeated strong disturbances in the uppermost 3 m of the section below the main end-Permian mass extinction horizon. Two one-meter-thick disturbed beds, with convoluted bedding and fluid escape structures, are interpreted as seismites. Immediately above, three lenticular, fining-upward, bioclastic grainstone beds, interbedded with argillites, are interpreted as tsunamites. In these beds, hummocky cross-stratification and grading indicate deposition by waning irregular waves at a minimum water depth of 100 m based on physical processes and faunas. Bed grain sizes indicate that the waves needed to move even the coarse sand of the matrix, let alone associated large pebbles up to 20 cm in diameter, range from amplitudes of ∼40 m for wave periods of 10 s (the upper limit for storm waves) to amplitudes of ∼3 m for wave periods of 50 to 1000 s (typical of large open-ocean tsunamis). Fossil and sedimentary evidence suggests lengthy intervals between successive tsunami events, which, together with a lack of geochemical evidence for impact, favors terrestrial causes. Geochemical proxies show that the Guryul Ravine environment remained oxic or suboxic throughout the P–Tr transition, but that anoxia developed regionally at the time of the boundary crisis. This paper is the first to propose seismites and tsunamites at the P-Tr boundary, so the geographic extent of these deposits is unknown, although analogous deposits occur in many sections worldwide from published reports.},

The Vikingh{\&}oslash;gda Formation replaces the Vardebukta and Sticky Keep Formations of Buchan et al. (1965) and the lower part of the Barents{\&}oslash;ya Formation of Lock et al. (1978) as extended geographically by M{\&}oslash;rk, Knarud et al. (1982) in central Spitsbergen, Barents{\&}oslash;ya and Edge{\&}oslash;ya. The formation consists of three member: the Deltadalen Member (composed of mudstones with sandstones and siltstones), the Lusitaniadalen Member (dominated by mudstones with thin siltstone beds and some limestone concretions) and the Vendomdalen Member (composed of dark shales with dolomite interbeds and nodules). The Lusitaniadalen and Vendomdalen members replace the former Sticky Keep Formation/ Member in the siirne areu. The Vikingh{\&}oslash;da Formation can be followed through central and eastern Spitsbergen to Barent{\&}oslash;ya and Edge{\&}oslash;ya and includes all sediments between the chert-rich Kapp Starostin Formation (Permian) and the organic-rich shales of the Botneheia Formation (Middle Triassic). The subdivision into three members is also reflected in the organic carbon content and palynofacies. Upwards, each succeeding member becomes more distal, organic-rich and oil-prone than the one below. The Vikingh{\&}oslash;da Formation is well-dated by six ammonoid zones, although the transitional beds between the Deltadalen and Lusitaniadalen members lack age diagnostic macrofossils. Corresponding palynozonation and magnetustratigraphy have also been determined. The overall stratigraphical development correlates well with other key Triassic areas in the Arctic, although intervals in the late Dienerian and early Smithian may be condensed or missing.},

abstract = {Rationale: IMS 7f-GEO isotope ratio applications increasingly involve analyses (e.g., S– or O– isotopes, coupled with primary ion currents {\textless}30 pA) for which quasi-simultaneous arrival (QSA) could compromise precision and accuracy of data. QSA and associated correction have been widely investigated for the CAMECA NanoSIMS instruments, but not for the IMS series. Methods: Sulfur and oxygen isotopic ratio experiments were performed using an electron multiplier (EM) detector, employing Cs+ primary ion currents of 1, 2, 5 and 11.5 pA (nominal) and a variety of secondary ion transmissions to vary QSA probability. An experiment to distinguish between QSA undercounting and purported aperture-related mass fractionation was performed using an EM for 16O– and 18O– plus an additional 16O– measurement using a Faraday cup (FC) detector. An experiment to investigate the accuracy of the QSA correction was performed by comparing S isotopic ratios obtained using an EM with those obtained on the same sample using dual FCs. Results: The QSA effect was observed on the IMS-7f-GEO, and QSA coefficients ($\beta$) of {\~{}}0.66 were determined, in agreement with reported NanoSIMS measurements, but different from the value (0.5) predicted using Poisson statistics. Aperture-related fractionation was not sufficient to explain the difference but uncertainties in primary ion flux measurement could play a role. When QSA corrected, the isotope ratio data obtained using the EM agreed with the dual FC data, within statistical error. Conclusions: QSA undercounting could compromise isotope ratio analyses requiring {\~{}}1 × 105 counts per second for the major isotope and primary currents {\textless}20 pA. The error could be {\textgreater}8‰ for a 1 pA primary current. However, correction can be accurately applied. For instrumental mass fractionation (IMF)-corrected data, the magnitude of the error resulting from not correcting for QSA is dependent on the difference in secondary ion count rate between the unknown and standard analyses.

abstract = {We have combined several different methodologies to quantify rates of organic carbon mineralization by the various electron acceptors in sediments from the coast of Denmark and Norway. Rates of NH4+ and Sigma CO2 liberation sediment incubations were used with O2 penetration depths to conclude that O2 respiration accounted for only between 3.6-17.4{\%} of the total organic carbon oxidation. Dentrification was limited to a narrow zone just below the depth of O2 penetration, and was not a major carbon oxidation pathway. The processes of Fe reduction, Mn reduction and sulfate reduction dominated organic carbon mineralization, but their relative significance varied depending on the sediment. Where high concentrations of Mn-oxide were found (3-4 wt{\%} Mn), only Mn reduction occurred. With lower Mn oxide concentrations more typical of coastal sediments, Fe reduction and sulfate reduction were most important and of a similar magnitude. Overall, most of the measured O2 flux into the sediment was used to oxidized reduced inorganic species and not organic carbon. We suspect that the importance of O2 respiration in many coastal sediments has been overestimated, whereas metal oxide reduction (both Fe and Mn reduction) has probably been well underestimated.},

abstract = {Johnson et al. (1997-this issue) provide a detailed data set on dissolved Fe and compare their data with those from four other laboratories which show simi- lar deep ocean profiles. From these data sets, they hypothesize that dissolved Fe concentrations in deep ocean waters are controlled primarily by organic complexation although dissolved Fe in deep waters is weakly correlated with aeolian deposition. There is no correlation with surface dissolved Fe and aeolian deposition. From their analysis of these data sets, they indicate several major areas for future research. (1) There is a need for interlaboratory compar- isons so that we can assess high Fe values in other environments not included in these data sets. (2) There are few time series measurements. (3) There are no detailed transects of Fe across coastal boundaries. (4) There are no measurements of Fe in many areas of the ocean; these need to be correlated with aeolian flux measurements. (5) There is a need to understand the role of particulate Fe as a source of bioavailable Fe; photo- chemical processes may be crucial in mobilizing Fe. (6) There is a need to understand the physical chemistry of Fe solubility from both inorganic and organic processes at oceanic Fe concentrations. In this discussion, we address several of these areas as we reexamine our previous data using simi- lar data reduction approaches as Johnson et al. (1997-this issue). We applaud Johnson et al. (1997- this issue) for coupling their data set with the data sets of others and stimulating discussion with their interpretations.

abstract = {The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous continental flood basalt provinces on Earth. The mass extinction at the end of the Permian was the most severe in the history of life. In the present paper, these two major concurrent events that occurred are analysed and a geochemical model coupled with an energy balance model is used to calculate their environmental impact on atmospheric CO2, oceanic $\delta$13C, and marine anoxia. The latitudinal temperature gradient is reduced relative to today, resulting in warmer temperatures at high latitudes. The warmer climate and the presence of fresh basaltic provinces increase the weatherability of the continental surfaces, resulting in an enhanced consumption of atmospheric CO2 through weathering. First, the eruption of the Siberian traps is accompanied by a massive volume of 13C depleted CO2 degassed from the mantle and added to the ocean through silicate weathering, thus lowering marine $\delta$13C. Second, the rapid collapse in productivity induces a strong decrease in the global organic carbon burial. This too tends to increase the proportion of light carbon in the ocean. These two effects can explain the low $\delta$13C values across the PT boundary, and methane release need not be invoked to explain the $\delta$13C fluctuations. It is proposed that the phosphorus cycle, which drives primary production in the model, plays an important role on the recovery of productivity and the $\delta$13C variations.},

abstract = {The impact of cyanobacteria Gloeocapsa sp. on calcium carbonate precipitation has been examined by combining physico-chemical macroscopic and in-situ microscopic techniques. For this, Ca adsorption and assimilation and kinetic experiments were used to assess the existence of the metabolic process responsible for CaCO3 mineralization by Gloeocapsa sp. Experimental products were characterized by Scanning and Transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM and TEM) imaging, XRD analyses, coupled with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Raman micro-spectroscopy. Ca carbonate precipitation experiments were performed at an initial pH of 7.8 to 9.4 and 25°C in supersaturated solutions ($\Omega$calcite=1.5 to 150) in the presence of active cyanobacterial cells. During cyanobacterial photosynthesis, the solution pH increased up to 9.5-10.8 after the first 5-10days of growth, the Ca concentration decreased and the supersaturation index attained a maximum followed by a gradual decrease due to progressive CaCO3 precipitation. Ca adsorption at the surface of live and inactivated Gloeocapsa sp. cells and Ca intracellular assimilation during cell growth were measured as a function of pH and Ca concentration in solution. The contribution of surface adsorption and intracellular uptake to total Ca removal from solution due to biocalcification does not exceed 10{\%}. The presence of calcium carbonate, identified as calcite using Raman spectroscopy, on active Gloeocapsa sp. surfaces and in the vicinity of bacterial cell surfaces was evidenced using SEM. TEM and CLSM demonstrated cyanobacterial cell encrustation by CaCO3 precipitated in the form of nano-spheres adjacent to the cell surface. In contrast to other previously investigated calcifying bacteria, no cellular protection mechanism against Ca2+ adsorption and subsequent carbonate precipitation has been demonstrated for Gloeocapsa sp.

abstract = {Significant changes in global climate and carbon cycling occurred during the Early Cretaceous. This study examines the expression of such climatic events in high-latitude Svalbard together with the stratigraphic utility of carbon-isotope stratigraphies. Isotopic analysis of fossil wood fragments (from the Rurikfjellet, Helvetiafjellet, and Carolinefjellet formations, Festningen, Spitsbergen) record a distinctive pattern including a negative isotope excursion preceding a positive event, correlatable with the global early Aptian isotope event. Our carbon-isotope profile improves the stratigraphic correlation and relative dating of the succession. We show that the upper part of the Helvetiafjellet Formation was deposited during the early Aptian, and not the late Barremian, as previously thought. Furthermore, we estimate an age for the abrupt contact of the Rurikfjellet Formation with the overlying Helvetiafjellet Formation (associated with a pulse of igneous activity) to be ca. 129 Ma or ca. 124 Ma, depending on which age model for the Early Cretaceous is used.The well-known dinosaur footprints of the Helvetiafjellet Formation at Festningen are constrained to the middle Barremian and, coupled with floral data, support a warm late Barremian prior to the Aptian carbon-isotope event. The appearance of glendonites at 655 m in the Carolinefjellet Formation is consistent with global cooling in the late Aptian–early Albian.},

abstract = {Carbon isotopic studies from marine organic matter of the Permian-Triassic Maitai Group, New Zealand, reveal a significant 513Corg shift toward more negative values within the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. These isotopic data chemostratigraphically define the previously debated position of the Permian-Triassic boundary in the Maitai Group. The Permian-Triassic record of the Maitai Group is also important because of its high paleolatitudinal setting and the deposition at intermediate depths in the ocean (c. 400 m) within a volcanic arc-related basin. Marine Permian-Triassic strata deposited at water depths deeper than shelf areas are rare. High latitude Permian-Triassic boundary sections document a significantly larger isotopic offset across the boundary compared with lower latitude settings. Carbon isotopic values decrease rapidly by an average of 7{\%}o from homogeneous values (x -25{\%}o) in the Tramway and lower Little Ben Sandstone Formation to highly lluctuating and very depleted values (x -32{\%}o) within the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. The lowermost Big Ben and Tramway Formations are considered to be Permian in age, based on their homogeneous and comparably heavier carbon isotopic values and supported by fossil atomodesmatinid bivalves. Based on the distinct 513Corg excursion toward negative values and the concurrent onset of strong isotopic fluctuations, the Permian-Triassic boundary is placed in the lower half of the Little Ben Sandstone Formation. Very depleted 813C values in the Little Ben Sandstone Formation of-38{\%}o indicate a contribution from isotopically light methane. A possible methane source is clathrates, released by large submarine slides or warming-induced melting of permafrost. The Little Ben Sandstone Formation has been interpreted as a massive event deposit from a submarine slide (Landis 1980). This hypothesised methane release could have been in part responsible for the larger Permian-Triassic isotopic shift in high latitudes compared with low latitudes because large volumes of clathrates are trapped in continental shelves and high-latitude permafrost. },

abstract = {Basin-scale correlations in the subsurface generally rely on lithostratigraphic information synthesized from wireline logs, and, in some cases, well cuttings, and cores. However, lithostratigraphic boundaries are often diachronous, and, as such, the correlations based upon them may not provide reliable timelines. In this paper, we use BLTN12231eq1 data from well cuttings and a core to generate chronostratigraphic logs of Late Ordovician strata spanning the Black River Group, Trenton Group, and Utica Shale across the subsurface of New York State. Although particular BLTN12231eq2 values may be impacted by (primary) variability in local dissolved inorganic carbon reservoirs and/or (secondary) diagenetic alteration, it is possible to identify spatially and stratigraphically coherent patterns in BLTN12231eq3, which can be used to effectively correlate time-equivalent strata on a basin-wide (or even global) scale, including across lithologies (e.g., between limestone and calcareous shale). The present study emphasizes the use of well cuttings, as these are commonly collected during drilling and can provide the maximum lateral resolution for subsurface correlation. Parallel geochemical (percent carbonate and total organic carbon) and isotopic (BLTN12231eq4 and BLTN12231eq5) data are used to understand the origin of stratigraphic and spatial variability in the BLTN12231eq6 signal and to identify diagenetic alteration. Stratigraphically coherent BLTN12231eq7 trends across New York were used to identify six isotopically distinct packages of time-equivalent strata within these formations. Pairing chemostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic data improves our ability to document the diachronous nature of lithologic contacts, including the base of the Utica Shale, which is progressively younger moving west through New York.},

Because there is typically a greater abundance of235U16O+ and238U16O+ molecular secondary ions than235U+ and238U+ atomic ions when uranium-bearing materials are sputtered with an oxygen primary ion beam, the goal was to understand whether use of235U16O/238U16O has the potential for improved accuracy and precision when compared to the235U/238U ratio. The UO2 and silicate reference materials showed the greatest potential for improved accuracy and precision through use of the235U16O/238U16O ratio as compared to the235U/238U ratio. For the UO2, which was investigated at a variety of primary beam currents, and the silicate reference materials, which were only investigated using a single primary beam current, this improvement was especially pronounced at low235U+ count rates. In contrast, comparison of the235U16O/238U16O ratio versus the235U/238U ratio from the other uranium compounds clearly indicates that the235U16O/238U16O ratio results in worse precision and accuracy. This behavior is based on the observation that the atomic (235U+ and238U+) to molecular (235U16O+ and238U16O+) secondary ion production rates remain internally consistent within the UO2 and silicate reference materials, whereas it is highly variable in the other uranium compounds. Efforts to understand the origin of this behavior suggest that irregular sample surface topography, and/or molecular interferences arising from the manner in which the UO2F2, UO3, UO2(NO3)2{\textperiodcentered}6(H2O), and UF4 were prepared, may be a major contributing factor to the inconsistent relationship between the observed atomic and molecular secondary ion yields. Overall, the results suggest that for certain bulk compositions, use of the235U16O/238U16O may be a viable approach to improving the precision and accuracy in situations where a relatively low235U+ count rate is expected.},

This reveals that Hindeodus increased and Clarkina sharply declined in abundance during a phase of relative sea-level rise which began at the end-Permian (Bed 25) and extended into Early Triassic. This was associated with the development of anoxic conditions. This distribution does not accord with previous suggestions that Hindeodus was a nearshore, shallow water taxon. The decline of the supposed deeper water genus Clarkina is also somewhat surprising but it may relate to the inhibition of a nektobenthic genus by dysoxic-anoxic bottom waters. The widespread facies and geographic distribution of Hindeodus suggests it was a pelagic type unaffected by anoxic bottom waters. Hence, the Hindeodus lineage provides a reliable criterion for identification of the Permian-Triassic boundary. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights: reserved.},

abstract = {Oxygenation of the Earth's surface is increasingly thought to have occurred in two steps. The first step, which occurred approximately 2,300 million years (Myr) ago, involved a significant increase in atmospheric oxygen concentrations and oxygenation of the surface ocean. A further increase in atmospheric oxygen appears to have taken place during the late Neoproterozoic period ( approximately 800-542 Myr ago). This increase may have stimulated the evolution of macroscopic multicellular animals and the subsequent radiation of calcified invertebrates, and may have led to oxygenation of the deep ocean. However, the nature and timing of Neoproterozoic oxidation remain uncertain. Here we present high-resolution carbon isotope and sulphur isotope records from the Huqf Supergroup, Sultanate of Oman, that cover most of the Ediacaran period (approximately 635 to approximately 548 Myr ago). These records indicate that the ocean became increasingly oxygenated after the end of the Marinoan glaciation, and they allow us to identify three distinct stages of oxidation. When considered in the context of other records from this period, our data indicate that certain groups of eukaryotic organisms appeared and diversified during the second and third stages of oxygenation. The second stage corresponds with the Shuram excursion in the carbon isotope record and seems to have involved the oxidation of a large reservoir of organic carbon suspended in the deep ocean, indicating that this event may have had a key role in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms. Our data thus provide new insights into the oxygenation of the Ediacaran ocean and the stepwise restructuring of the carbon and sulphur cycles that occurred during this significant period of Earth's history.},

abstract = {Microbially mediated sulfate reduction affects the isotopic composition of dissolved and solid sulfur species in marine sediments. Experiments and field data show that the $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - composition is also modified in the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms. This has been attributed either to a kinetic isotope effect during the reduction of sulfate to sulfite, cell-internal exchange reactions between enzymatically-activated sulfate (APS), and/or sulfite with cytoplasmic water. The isotopic fingerprint of these processes may be further modified by the cell-external reoxidation of sulfide to elemental sulfur, and the subsequent disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate or by the oxidation of sulfite to sulfate. Here we report $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - values from interstitial water samples of ODP Leg 182 (Site 1130) and provide the mathematical framework to describe the oxygen isotope fractionation of sulfate during microbial sulfate reduction. We show that a purely kinetic model is unable to explain our $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - data, and that the data are well explained by a model using oxygen isotope exchange reactions. We propose that the oxygen isotope exchange occurs between APS and cytoplasmic water, and/or between sulfite and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) during APS formation. Model calculations show that cell external reoxidation of reduced sulfur species would require up to 3000 mol/m3 of an oxidant at ODP Site 1130, which is incompatible with the sediment geochemical data. In addition, we show that the volumetric fluxes required to explain the observed $\delta$ 18 OSO42 - data are on average 14 times higher than the volumetric sulfate reduction rates (SRR) obtained from inverse modeling of the porewater data. The ratio between the gross sulfate flux into the microbes and the net sulfate flux through the microbes is depth invariant, and independent of sulfide concentrations. This suggests that both fluxes are controlled by cell density and that cell-specific sulfate reduction rates remain constant with depth. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Here, we show that the bioavailability of dissolved Fe may decline because of ocean acidification. Acidification of media containing various Fe compounds decreases the Fe uptake rate of diatoms and coccolithophores to an extent predicted by the changes in Fe chemistry. A slower Fe uptake by a model diatom with decreasing pH is also seen in experiments with Atlantic surface water. The Fe requirement of model phytoplankton remains unchanged with increasing CO2. The ongoing acidification of seawater is likely to increase the Fe stress of phytoplankton populations in some areas of the ocean.},

abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO(2) (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

abstract = {Veacute;rard et al. (2015, Journal of Palaeogeography, 4(1): 64-84) claim that their global geodynamic model allows one to reconstruct the surface features of topography on land and in adjacent oceans (i.e., paleobathymetry) anywhere on the globe and at any geological time during the past 600 million years (Ma). Such a grand model requires a rigorous scrutiny. The purpose of this discussion is to illustrate that the model suffers from (1) the selective omission of real-world datasets that do not fit the model, (2) the inclusion of datasets without revealing their original sources or without citing relevant peer-reviewed publications, (3) the emphasis on ‘unpublished' internal company datasets that disallow open access to the international scientific community, and (4) the use of poorly understood concepts without providing the basic conceptual clarity. These deficiencies undermine the credibility of the heuristic model.},

abstract = {The crater lake of the small volcanic island Satonda, Indonesia, is unique for its red-algal microbial reefs thriving in marine-derived water of increased alkalinity. The lake is a potential analogue for ancient oceans sustaining microbialites under open-marine conditions. Current reef surfaces are dominated by living red algae covered by non-calcified biofilms with scattered cyanobacteria and diatoms. Minor {\{}{\{}{\}}CaCO3{\{}{\}}{\}} precipitates are restricted to the seasonally flooded reef tops, which develop biofilms up to 500 $\mu$m thick dominated by the cyanobacteria Pleurocapsa, Calothrix, Phormidium, and Hyella. Microcrystalline aragonite patches form within the biofilm mucilage, and fibrous aragonite cements grow in exopolymer-poor spaces such as the inside of dead, lysed green algal cells, and reef framework voids. Cementation of lysed hadromerid sponge resting bodies results in the formation of {\{}{\{}{\}}"Wetheredella-like"{\{}{\}}{\}} {\{}{\{}{\}}structures.Hydrochemistry{\{}{\}}{\}} data and model calculations indicate that {\{}{\{}{\}}CO2{\{}{\}}{\}} degassing after seasonal mixis can shift the carbonate equilibrium to cause {\{}{\{}{\}}CaCO3{\{}{\}}{\}} precipitation. Increased concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon limit the ability of autotrophic biofilm microorganisms to shift the carbonate equilibrium. Therefore, photosynthesis-induced cyanobacterial calcification does not occur. Instead, passive, diffusion-controlled {\{}{\{}{\}}EPS-mediated{\{}{\}}{\}} permineralization of biofilm mucus at contact with the considerably supersaturated open lake water takes place. In contrast to extreme soda lakes, the release of Ca2+ from aerobic degradation of extracellular polymeric substances does not support {\{}{\{}{\}}CaCO3{\{}{\}}{\}} precipitation in Satonda because the simultaneously released {\{}{\{}{\}}CO2{\{}{\}}{\}} is insufficiently {\{}{\{}{\}}buffered.Subfossil{\{}{\}}{\}} reef parts comprise green algal tufts encrusted by microstromatolites with layers of fibrous aragonite and an amorphous, unidentified {\{}{\{}{\}}Mg-Si{\{}{\}}{\}} phase. The microstromatolites probably formed when Lake Satonda evolved from seawater to Ca2+-depleted raised-alkalinity conditions because of sulfate reduction in bottom sediments and pronounced seasonality with deep mixing events and strong {\{}{\{}{\}}CO2{\{}{\}}{\}} degassing. The latter effect caused rapid growth of fibrous aragonite, while {\{}{\{}{\}}Mg-Si{\{}{\}}{\}} layers replaced the initially Mg-calcite-impregnated biofilms. This could be explained by dissolution of siliceous diatoms and sponge spicules at high {\{}{\{}{\}}pH{\{}{\}}{\}}, followed by Mg-calcite dissolution and Mg-silica precipitation at low {\{}{\{}{\}}pH{\{}{\}}{\}} due to heterotrophic activity within the entombed biofilms.},

abstract = {Over the Early-Middle Frasnian boundary interval (Late Devonian), the oceans experienced major changes in global carbon cycling and nutrient dynamics with a prominent positive carbon isotope shift at the base of the Palmatolepis punctata Zone (Middle Frasnian). The aim of this study was to construct seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratio curves for the Pa. transitans-Pa. hassi zonal interval using well-preserved conodont apatite from two sections in the Holy Cross Mountains, south-central Poland. The final curves suggest that seawater 87Sr/86Sr values were steady at {\~{}} 0.70794-0.70799 during the transitans Zone but began to rise in the early punctata Zone towards a value of {\~{}} 0.70814 in the late punctata Zone (an increase of {\~{}} 0.0002). The increase in seawater 87Sr/86Sr values over the Early-Middle Frasnian boundary appears to be the second of two prominent short-term rises in 87Sr/86Sr values, which led to an overall shift in values from a Givetian plateau of between {\~{}} 0.70780 and 0.70785 to a Late Frasnian plateau of between 0.7080 and 0.7082. Correlation with a regional positive ??13C anomaly and evidence for eutrophication in the marine environment suggests that the causes of these phenomena may be linked and that the positive 87Sr/86Sr shift was caused by an increase in the continental flux of Sr to the oceans, i.e., the weathering flux. A possible explanation for an increase in the weathering flux is the denudation of a new Acadian-Eovariscan orogen, which would have been mostly weathered in the humid, warm tropical/equatorial region. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The pre-Rhaetian Triassic succession in the Danish Basin is generally dominated by red bed deposits unsuitable for preservation of organic material. However, during the late Middle Triassic a temporary change to wetter conditions resulted in preservation of diverse palynofloral assemblages, dominated by corystospermous seed fern pollen of Alisporites/Falcisporites and characterized by high abundances of the conifer pollen Protodiploxypinus gracilis, as well as common to abundant lycophyte spores assigned to Aratrisporites spp. A mid-Ladinian to early Carnian (earliest Julian) age is inferred for this interval based on the presence of the probable gymnosperm pollen Staurosaccites quadrifidus, rare Retisulcites perforatus (of unknown affinity) and Enzonalasporites vigens of probably voltzialean affinity. No marine palynomorphs were recorded, only rare specimens of Ovoidites sp. and Plaesiodictyon mosellanum. Thus, together with previously recorded other fossils (a fish microfauna, an ostracod, plant remains and characeans) the recorded palynoflora indicates semi-arid conditions and deposition in a terrestrial to marginal fresh- or brackish water environment. After this, red bed deposition resumed in the area, and it is not until the mid-Rhaetian that well preserved and diverse palynofloras are again encountered in the succession. The Rhaetian palynofloras are significantly different to the Ladinian–early Carnian assemblages, being dominated by tree fern spores (Deltoidospora spp.), taxodiacean/cupressacean pollen (Perinopollenites elatoides), and the enigmatic gymnosperm pollen assigned to Ricciisporites tuberculatus. As much as 62{\%} of the mid-Ladinian to Early Carnian spore-pollen taxa were not recorded in the Rhaetian, suggesting that major restructuring of the terrestrial ecosystem took place in this area during the Carnian and Norian. In comparison, 34{\%} of the Rhaetian spore-pollen taxa recorded in this study, e.g. R. tuberculatus, Polypodiisporites polymicroforatus, Limbosporites lundbladiae and Cingulizonates rhaeticus, disappeared during the well-recognized end-Triassic event. The extinction interval is also characterized by a dramatic increase in the number of reworked palynomorphs, indicating erosion of the hinterland at this time. There is a marked drop in diversity from the Late Triassic to the earliest Jurassic. The palynology indicates that the established post-extinction vegetation was dominated by tree ferns (Deltoidospora) and pinacean conifers (Pinuspollenites minimus), along with common taxodiacean/cupressacean conifers, ginkgos/cycads and corystospermous seed ferns, and that it remained relatively stable during the Hettangian to early Sinemurian.},

abstract = {Data from five marine sections across the Permian-Triassic boundary in southern China reveal a pattern of 13C-depleted carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb) in different facies spanning carbonate platform to lower slope. A gradual decrease of $\delta$13Ccarb is evident in all sections and matched by an opposing change in 87Sr/86Sr from the Late Permian to the Induan (Early Triassic). These complementary trends in strontium and carbon isotope data imply an extended period of enhanced continental uplift and weathering of silicates and organic matter across the Permian-Triassic event boundary (PTEB). A pronounced sharp drop of $\delta$13Ccarb at the PTEB is most recognizable in the upper ramp environment of Meishan, occurs weakly in shallow water environments and cannot be discerned in the deepest water setting. We propose that this pattern reflects an enhancement of stratified-ocean conditions in the immediate aftermath of the latest Permian transgression. The sharp drop in $\delta$13Ccarb at the PTEB in the platform ramp environments likely resulted from the depth-selective calcification of 13C-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) formed by respiration of organic matter including, perhaps, methane. Indeed, massive volcanism at the PTEB would have enhanced eutrophication and stratification thereby slowing the mixing of 13C-depleted DIC into deeper-water environments.},

abstract = {Many negative $\delta$(13)C excursions in marine carbonates from the geological record are interpreted to record significant biogeochemical events in early Earth history. The assumption that no post-depositional processes can simultaneously alter carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C values towards more negative values is the cornerstone of this approach. However, the effects of post-depositional alteration on the relationship between carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C values have not been directly evaluated. Here we present paired carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C records that exhibit a coupled negative excursion resulting from multiple periods of meteoric alteration of the carbonate $\delta$(13)C record, and consequent contributions of isotopically negative terrestrial organic matter to the sedimentary record. The possibility that carbonate and organic $\delta$(13)C records can be simultaneously shifted towards lower $\delta$(13)C values during periods of subaerial exposure may necessitate the reappraisal of some of the $\delta$(13)C anomalies associated with noteworthy biogeochemical events throughout Earth history.},

abstract = {Sapropel layers in the sediment record of the Mediterranean Sea reflect periods of climate-induced elevated marine production associated with precessional minima. Some of these layers feature interruptions that represent centennial-to-millennial returns to the predominantly low-productivity conditions of this sea. We have measured multiple geochemical paleoproductivity proxies in the interrupted sapropel layer that corresponds to insolation cycle 90 (955 ka) at 1-cm intervals in a four-site transect from the Balearic Basin to the Levantine Basin to assess similarities and differences in its expression at the four locations. The interrupted sapropels are similarly divided by an organic-carbon-poor interval into an upper layer in which organic carbon concentrations reach 2-7 wt.{\%} and a lower layer in which they peak between 1 and 3 wt.{\%}. The interruption was essentially synchronous in the Balearic Basin, the Tyrrhenian Basin, and the Ionian Basin, but it was delayed and shorter in the Levantine Basin. Lighter nitrogen isotope compositions consistently accompany higher organic carbon accumulation rates in the sapropel layers, which implies a shift from coccolith-dominated organic matter production towards a mode of primary production in which cyanobacteria were important during times of sapropel deposition. Organic carbon isotopic compositions become heavier as organic carbon accumulation increases at three of the locations, which is consistent with elevated productivity. However, they become lighter at the Levantine Basin site, which suggests greater delivery of isotopically light fluvial waters to this part of the Mediterranean Sea. The local paleoclimate conditions conducive to sapropel formation evidently were not completely uniform across the Mediterranean region but their occurrences were synchronous. Moreover, the co-existence of an essentially same-age interruption of the sapropels at the four locations shows that climate could change rapidly and concordantly across the region at much less than precessional intervals. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Thus, it is not surprising that these taxa suffered conspicuous mass extinctions at the times of three negative Early Triassic global carbon isotopic excursions that resembled those associated with the two preceding Permian mass extinctions. In keeping with their high rates of origination, both the ammonoids and conodonts rediversified dramatically between the Early Triassic crises. Other marine taxa, characterized by much lower intrinsic rates of origination, were held at low levels of diversity by the Early Triassic crises; because global mass extinctions affect all marine life, these taxa must have experienced relatively modest expansions and contractions that have yet to be discovered, because they do not stand out in the fossil record and because the stratigraphic ranges of these taxa, being of little value for temporal correlation, have not been thoroughly studied.},

abstract = {Interstitial water samples from seven ODP sites (Leg 181, Sites 1119-1125) of the southwestern Pacific Ocean have been analyzed for the stable sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate along with major and minor ions. Sulfate from the interstitial fluids ($\delta$34S values between +20. 7 and +60‰ vs. the SO2-based Vienna-Canyon Diablo troilite standard) was enriched in 34S with respect to modern sea water ($\delta$34S≈+20.6‰) indicating that microbial sulfate reduction takes place to different extents at all investigated sites. Microbial sulfate reduction (MSR) was found at all sites, the intensity depending on the availability of organic matter which is controlled by paleo-sedimentation conditions (sedimentation rate, presence of turbidites) and productivity. Microbial net sulfate reduction was additionally confirmed by modeling interstitial water sulfate profiles. Areal net sulfate reduction rates up to 14 mmol m-2 yr-1 have been calculated which were positively related to sedimentation rates. Total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS; essentially pyrite) as a product of microbial sulfate reduction was isotopically characterized in squeeze cake samples and gave $\delta$ 34S values between -51 and +9‰ indicating pyrite formation both close to the sediment-water interface and later diagenetic contributions. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract – The intensity and extent of anoxia during the two Kellwasser anoxic events has been
investigated in a range of European localities using amultidisciplinary approach (pyrite framboid assay,
gamma-ray spectrometry and sediment fabric analysis). The results reveal that the development of the
Lower Kellwasser Horizon in the early Late rhenana Zone (Frasnian Stage) in German type sections
does not always coincide with anoxic events elsewhere in Europe and, in some locations, seafloor
oxygenation improves during this interval. Thus, this anoxic event is not universally developed. In
contrast, the Upper Kellwasser Horizon, developed in the Late linguiformis Zone (Frasnian Stage) in
Germany correlates with a European-wide anoxic event that is manifest as an intensification of anoxia
in basinal locations to the point that stable euxinic conditionswere developed (for example, in the basins
of the Holy Cross Mountains, Poland). The interval also saw the spread of dysoxic waters into very
shallow water (for instance, reefal) locations, and it seems reasonable to link the contemporaneous
demise of many marine taxa to this phase of intense and widespread anoxia. In basinal locations,
euxinic conditions persisted into the earliest Famennian with little change of depositional conditions.
Only in the continental margin location of Austria was anoxia not developed at any time in the Late
Devonian. Consequently it appears that the Upper Kellwasser anoxic event was an epicontinental
seaway phenomenon, caused by the upward expansion of anoxia from deep basinal locales rather than
an ‘oceanic' anoxic event that has spilled laterally into epicontinental settings.},

abstract = {Stable isotope ratios of the life science elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen vary slightly, but significantly in major compartments of the earth. Owing mainly to antropogenic activities including land use change and fossil fuel burning, the 13C/12C ratio of CO2 in the atmosphere has changed over the last 200 years by 1.5 parts per thousand (from about 0.0111073 to 0.0110906). In between interglacial warm periods and glacial maxima, the 18O/16O ratio of precipitation in Greenland has changed by as much as 5 parts per thousand (0.001935-0.001925). While seeming small, such changes are detectable reliably with specialised mass spectrometric techniques. The small changes reflect natural fractionation processes that have left their signature in natural archives. These enable us to investigate the climate of past times in order to understand how the Earth's climatic system works and how it can react to external forcing. In addition, studying contemporary isotopic change of natural compartments can help to identify sources and sinks for atmospheric trace gases provided the respective isotopic signatures are large enough for measurement and have not been obscured by unknown processes. This information is vital within the framework of the Kyoto process for controlling CO2 emissions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Paleozoic Middle East terranes, neighboring the present-day Arabian and Levant plates, are shown by most authors to consist of ten major tectonic units: (1 and 2) the Helmand and Farah terranes of Afghanistan, southwest Pakistan and southeast Turkmenistan; (3 to 6) the Alborz, Central Iran (Lut, Yazd and Tabas) and Sanandaj-Sirjan terranes of Iran, and Northwest Iran (possibly extending into eastern Turkey); (7 and 8) the Pontides and Taurides terranes of Turkey; and (9 and 10) the Greater and Lesser Caucasus terranes between the Caspian and Black seas (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia and southwest Russia). Published plate-tectonic reconstructions indicate that all ten terranes may have broken off from either: (1) the Gondwana Supercontinent in the mid-Silurian as part of the Hun Superterrane; or (2) the Pangea Supercontinent during the mid-Permian - Triassic as part of the Cimmeria Superterrane. To the north of Gondwana and Pangea, three successively younger Tethyan oceans evolved: (1) Proto-Tethys (Cambrian - Devonian); (2) Paleo-Tethys (mid-Silurian - Mesozoic); and (3) Neo-Tethys (mid-Permian - Cenozoic). Two regional Paleozoic unconformities in the Arabian Plate are generally linked to major regional-scale structural events, and commonly correlated to the Caledonian and Hercynian orogenies. These orogenies took place many thousands of kilometers away from the Arabian Plate and are considered unlikely causes for these unconformities. Instead, the breakaway of the Hun and Cimmeria superterranes are considered as alternative near-field tectonic sources. The older unconformity (middle Paleozoic event), represented by a mid-Silurian to Middle Devonian hiatus in North Arabia (Iraq and Syria), reflects an episode of epeirogenic uplift, which might be related to the mid-Silurian rift of the Hun Superterrane. The younger mid-Carboniferous Arabia-wide angular unconformity involved compressional faulting and epeirogenic uplift, and might be related to the earliest phase of subduction by the Paleo-Tethyan crust beneath Cimmeria (Sanandaj-Sirjan and nearby regions) before it broke off. Based on our review and regional considerations, we assign the Helmand, Farah, Central Iran, Alborz, Sanandaj-Sirjan, Northwest Iran, Lesser Caucasus, Taurides and Pontides to Cimmeria, whereas the Greater Caucasus is considered Hunic.},

abstract = {Detailed sampling and analysis of Jurassic pelagic limestones and marls from Italy, Hungary and Switzerland have enabled construction of an isotope stratigraphy across the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary with resolution to the zonal level. The oxygen-isotope record is unremarkable. The carbon isotopes, however, show two positive excursions: one, relatively minor, during the Pliensbachian, margaritatus Zone, subnodosus Subzone, the other, more Major, during the Toarcian, early falciferum Zone, where a maximum $\delta$[SUP13]C value of 4.52{\%}[SUB0PDB] is attained. These intervals are known to be favoured periods of organic-rich sedimentation in diverse parts of the globe and the isotopic excursions are interpreted as a response to abnormally high rates of storage of organic carbon in the sedimentary record. A comparable phenomenon has been documented from the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary in the Cretaceous where it has been referred to the influence of an 'Oceanic Anoxic Event'. Some Italian sections spanning this Lower Jurassic interval contain organic-rich shales in the falciferum Zone; the isotopic signatures from their included, locally manganiferous carbonate betray a considerable Zone; the isotopic signatures from their included, locally manganiferous carbonate betray a considerable diagenetic overprint and they cannot therefore be incorporated in a composite isotopic curve. Carbon isotopes from the organic carbon itself are extremely negative, falling to -33{\%}[SUB0PDB] and, in one section examined in detail, correlate with the calcium-carbonate content of the shales; they may reflect a partial change to a non-calcified planktonic biota during deposition of this lime-poor interval, possibly responding to upwelling and increased fertility of near-surface water. The onset of upwelling may have been as early as spinatum-tenuicostatum Zone time, that is, at the Pliensbachian-Toarcian boundary.

abstract = {A 2-4{\%} negative shift of $\delta$13C has been reported from many Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary sections around the world. Our carbon isotopic measurements of bulk carbonate and organic matter from the Meishan section, South China show that a -3{\%} shift of $\delta$13C spanned 30 ka over the end-Permian mass extinction. Carbon isotopic excursions ($\delta$13Ccarb, $\delta$13Corg) coupled with $\Delta$13C (=$\delta$13Ccarb-$\delta$13Corg), marine kerogen {\%}, 87Sr/86Sr of siliciclastics and total organic carbon show geochemical signals underwent six geochemical variation zones (GVZ) over the P/Tr transition. Of these, GVZ 1 corresponds to the lower-middle parts of Bed 24e-1, GVZ 2 to the upper part of Bed 24e-1, GVZ 3 to Beds 24e-2, 24e-3, 25-2 and 25-2, GVZ 4 to Bed 25-3, GVZ 5 to Bed 26, and GVZ 6 to Beds 27-29. A-1{\%}shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka before the main extinction was probably generated by possible dissociation of methane hydrate by warming. Subsequent mixing of anoxic stratified ocean led to another-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 5 ka during the extinction. The-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka after the main extinction has probably resulted from massive denudation of soil and sediments caused by the collapse of forests and possible dissociation of methane hydrate at the end of the Permian. Furthermore, a dramatic drop of $\Delta$13C values from 29-30{\%} in Bed 24e-3 to 25{\%} in Bed 25 indicates an abrupt proliferation of phototrophic sulfur bacteria immediately after the main episode of the end-Permian mass extinction. The $\Delta$13C value increases to 29-30{\%} in Bed 26 again, and this is probably due to massive denudation of soil and sediment caused by the collapse of forests between 0 and 27 ka after the main extinction, as revealed by negative shift of $\delta$13C. Low $\Delta$13C value recorded in Beds 27-29 indicates that phototrophic sulfur bacteria may have thrived again and lasted more than 150 ka after the main extinction in the low-latitude Paleo-Tethys. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of Australia.},

abstract = {Thermally unaltered conodont elements, brachiopods, and vertebrates were analyzed with reverse phase high profile liquid chromatography to locate and quantify amino acid remnants of the original organic matrix in the fossils. No consistent similarities in amino acid content were found in conodont taxa, and criteria based on organic residues appear to have no taxonomic significance in the fossils tested from these localities. However, hydroxyproline, an amino acid that is found in the collagen molecules of animals, as well as in the glycoproteins in the cell walls and reproductive tissues of certain plants, is represented in most taxa. The organic matter retained in the impermeable crowns of conodont elements might have been derived originally from a form of collagen. Biochemical analyses, correlated with histochemical tests, demonstrate that organic matter is an integral part of the hyaline tissue of the element crown and not the result of surface contamination. Tests of a range of vertebrate and invertebrate fossil hard tissues produced similar results. The analyses indicate that hyaline tissue in the conodont element crown is not a form of vertebrate enamel, which contains no collagen. Albid tissue, with little or no organic content, is not a form of vertebrate bone or dentine, both based on collagen and low in mineral. Although these results do not help to determine the phylogenetic affinities of conodont animals, they indicate that conodont elements do not contain hard tissues characteristic of vertebrate animals.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. Mixing of sediments by moving animals becomes apparent in the trace fossil record from about 550 million years ago (Ma), loosely overlapping with the tail end of the extreme carbonate carbon isotope $\delta$ 13 C carbonate fluctuations that qualitatively distinguish the Proterozoic geochemical record from that of the Phanerozoic. These Precambrian-scale fluctuations in $\delta$ 13 C carbonate (PSF-$\delta$ 13 C carbonate ) remain enigmatic, due to their high amplitude and inclusion of global-scale negative $\delta$ 13 C carbonate values, below anything attributable to mantle input. Here, we note that different biogeochemical-model scenarios plausibly explaining globally synchronous PSF-$\delta$ 13 C carbonate converge: via mechanistic requirements for extensive anoxia in marine sediments to support sedimentary build-up of 13 C-depleted carbon. We hypothesize that bioturbation qualitatively reduced marine sediment anoxia by exposing sediments to oxygenated overlying waters, which ultimately contributed to decreasing the carbon cycle's subsequent susceptibility to PSF- $\delta$ 13 C carbonate . Bioturbation may also have reduced the quantity of (isotopically light) organic-derived carbon available to contribute to PSF- $\delta$ 13 C carbonate via ocean crust carbonatization at depth. We conduct a comparative modelling exercise in which we introduce bioturbation to existing model scenarios for PSF- $\delta$ 13 C carbonate : expressing both the anoxic proportion of marine sediments, and the global organic carbon burial efficiency, as a decreasing function of bioturbation. We find that bioturbation's oxygenating impact on sediments has the capacity to prevent PSF- $\delta$ 13 C carbonate caused by authigenic carbonate precipitation or methanogenesis. Bioturbation's impact on the f-ratio via remineralization is partially offset by liberation of organic phosphate, some of which feeds back into new production. We emphasize that this study is semiquantitative, exploratory and intended merely to provide a qualitative theoretical framework within which bioturbation's impact on long-term, first-order $\delta$ 13 C carbonate can be assessed (and it is hoped quantified in more detail by future work). With this proviso, we conclude that it is entirely plausible that bioturbation made a decisive contribution to the enigmatic directionality in the $\delta$ 13 C carbonate record, from the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian boundary onwards.},

For the first time, it allows an exact correlation of the PTB in all marine facies and faunal realms. The following features of the extinction and recovery patterns near the PTB are most important for the search for causes of the PTB biotic crisis: (1) most strongly affected were the (siliceous) plankton (radiolarians) and the warm-water benthos and nekton; (2) most of the cold-water faunas were not significantly affected; (3) the recovery of the warm-water benthos and siliceous plankton occurred only after an unusually long time (during the late Olenekian and Middle Triassic); (4) the productivity of the terrestrial plants dropped strongly and the recovery was mainly in the upper Olenekian and in the Middle Triassic; (5) several terrestrial extinction events occurred at different levels within the Upper Permian, considerable before the marine PTB; at or close to the FAD of Lystrosaurus no extinction event in the terrestrial faunas can be observed; (6) terrestrial faunal elements that survived the Dzhulfian-Dorashamian extinctions were able to survive some months of extreme climatic conditions by hibernation-like life stages (vertebrates), or by dry- and freezing-resistant eggs (conchostracans); (7) about 50{\%} of the genera that disappeared at the PTB re-appeared in the Olenekian-Middle Triassic interval (Lazarus taxa), or in this time interval genera appeared that had undoubtedly evolved from genera that had disappeared at the PTB; and (8) the PTB is preceded by mass occurrences of marine (and continental?) fungi, and the fungal spike ends abruptly a little before the PTB. A scenario for the PTB biotic crisis is elaborated that takes into consideration: the real (not interpolated) diversity patterns of different marine and continental fossil groups, the exact correlation of bioevents in different faunal realms and facies, the strong biotic crisis in the Tethyan warm-water faunas in contrast to the much weaker biotic event in cold-water faunas, the severe Dzhulfian-Dorashamian climate in many parts of the world caused by the continent-ocean configuration and by Siberian Trap volcanism, the cooling of the Boreal area by the northward drift of Pangaea that interrupted the exchange of warm-water benthos between the Tethys and western North America during the Guadalupian, the extinction event at the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary that restricted most of the affected warm-water faunas to the Tethys, the importance of lower Scythian anoxia that reached an unusually shallow level, and above all the effects of the contemporaneous huge volcanic events about 250 m.y. ago on the Siberian Platform and in the eastern Tethys that caused a 3-6-months-lasting volcanic winter with strong cooling in low latitudes, followed by a strong global warming.},

abstract = {In the southern and central Black Sea, reduced sulfur comprises nearly 1{\%} of the total particulate flux in the anoxic water column, as measured by time-series sediment traps. Sulfur isotopic composition of particulate sulfide fluxes indicates an origin near the oxic-anoxic interface, where dissolved sulfide is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulfide below 175 m due to chemical oxidation A strong seasonal correlation exists between sulfur and organic carbon fluxes; this, together with particulate sulfide precipitation at the oxic-anoxic interface, suggests that sulfides are scavenged from the interface during maximum production of settling organic aggregates, particularly during the late summer coccolithophorid blooms. Sulfide precipitation deeper in the water column and in sediments may be limited by availability of iron and/or polysulfides, since there are no particulate sulfide fluxes which have the same isotopic composition as ambient dissolved sulfide at trap depths. Since sulfides in surface sediments are often isotopically similar to dissolved sulfide at the top of the sulfide zone and to sediment trap fluxes, sedimentary sulfides could originate from metal sulfide fluxes forming at the oxic-anoxic interface and would reflect sulfur-cycling processes at the oxic-anoxic interface Sedimentary sulfate reduction rates estimated from assuming 6580{\%} utilization of particulate organic carbon fluxes agree reasonably well with other estimates of sulfate reduction and sulfide production rates. A sulfur isotope-based box model for sulfur cycling between dissolved and particulate phases in the water column and sediments is presented.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Astronomical observations of Centaurs and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) yield two characteristic features – near-infrared (NIR) reflectance and low geometric albedo. The first feature apparently originates due to complex organic material on their surfaces, but the origin of the material contributing to low albedo is not well understood. Titan tholins synthesized to simulate aerosols in the atmosphere of Saturn's moon Titan have also been used for simulating the NIR reflectances of several Centaurs and TNOs. Here, we report novel detections of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nanoscopic soot aggregates and cauliflower-like graphite within Titan tholins. We put forth a proof of concept stating the surfaces of Centaurs and TNOs may perhaps comprise of highly ‘carbonized' complex organic material, analogous to the tholins we investigated. Such material would apparently be capable of contributing to the NIR reflectances and to the low geometric albedos simultaneously.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

It is shown that the spheroidal form can o,:cur independently of the microcryst organisation and that aggregates of organised microcrysts are also observed in irregular non-spheroidal textures. Genetically, therefore, these two characteristic framboidal features are consideced separately. The development of the internal structure of the framboids is explained entirely as a function of the formation processes of pyrite, and the surface and crystal chemistry of the microcrysts. However, the spheroidal form is an inherited characteristic. It is shown that the physico-chemical, mechanical and spatial requirements of this texture are satisfied by processes involving the replacement or infilling of organic globules and gaseous vacuoles.},

abstract = {1 We compiled and standardized sediment trap data below 1000 m depth from 52 locations around the globe to infer the implications of the Armstrong et al. 2002 "ballast'' model to the ratio of organic carbon to calcium carbonate in the deep sea (the rain ratio). We distinguished three forms of mineral ballast: calcium carbonate, opal, and lithogenic material. We concur with Armstrong et al. 2002 that organic carbon sinking fluxes correlate tightly with mineral fluxes. Based on the correlations seen in the trap data, we conclude that most of the organic carbon rain in the deep sea is carried by calcium carbonate, because it is denser than opal and more abundant than terrigenous material. This analysis explains the constancy of the organic carbon to calcium carbonate rain ratio in the deep sea today, and argues against large changes in the mean value of this ratio in the past. However, sediment trap data show variability in the ratio in areas of high relative calcium carbonate export (mass CaCO3/mass ratio {\textgreater} 0.4), unexplainable by the model, leaving open the possibility of regional variations in the rain ratio in the past.},

abstract = {Burial of fish bones, which consist primarily of hydroxyapatite, has been recognized as a mechanism to remove reactive phosphorus from the oceans. In this study, a new method is presented, which differentiates P associated with biogenous apatite (Pfish with 2 M NH4 ) from other P fractions. The method, consisting of a sequential chemical extraction Cl, has been successfully tested on standard materials. It enables us, for the first time, to quantify fish debris in sediment records and to assess their importance for the marine phosphorus cycle. The NH4 significantly higher in sediments located above 1,200 m water depth than it is for deeper sediments. The distribution of Pfish related to differences in water depth and sedimentation rates. In addition, a good correlation between high sedi- mentary Pfish Cl extraction has been applied to sediment samples from the Arabian Sea. Preservation of fish debris is contents in surface sediments is predominantly governed by the extent of fish debris regeneration, which is contents and low oxygen bottom water concentrations suggests that the presence of the intense oxygen minimum zone may account for the enhanced preservation of fish debris in continental slope sediments.},

abstract = {The Early Cretaceous Epoch, about 145-100 million years ago, is generally thought of as a greenhouse period, with high atmospheric CO2 concentrations(1) and high global mean temperatures(2). But evidence for episodes of cooler conditions, and even transient glaciations, has been proposed(3-9). Here we present sea-surface temperature records spanning the period from 142 to 128 million years ago (Berriasian-Barremian ages) from low and mid latitudes, reconstructed using the TEX86 palaeotemperature proxy. During this period, we find sea-surface temperatures exceeding 32 degrees C at 15 degrees-20 degrees N and averaging 26 degrees C at similar to 53 degrees S. These temperatures substantially exceed modern temperatures at equivalent latitudes, and are incompatible with the notion of consistently cooler conditions in the earliest Cretaceous. Moreover, we find little variability in the sea-surface temperature records, even during the Valanginian carbon-isotope excursion similar to 138-135 million years ago, which was thought to be associated with marked temperature fluctuations(5). We conclude that the earliest Cretaceous was characterized by a warm, stable climate, with a lower meridional temperature gradient than today.},

abstract = {Ocean anoxic events were periods of high carbon burial that led to drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering of bottom-water oxygen concentrations and, in many cases, significant biological extinction. Most ocean anoxic events are thought to be caused by high productivity and export of carbon from surface waters which is then preserved in organic-rich sediments, known as black shales. But the factors that triggered some of these events remain uncertain. Here we present stable isotope data from a mid-Cretaceous ocean anoxic event that occurred 112 Myr ago, and that point to increased thermohaline stratification as the probable cause. Ocean anoxic event 1b is associated with an increase in surface-water temperatures and runoff that led to decreased bottom-water formation and elevated carbon burial in the restricted basins of the western Tethys and North Atlantic. This event is in many ways similar to that which led to the more recent Plio-Pleistocene Mediterranean sapropels, but the greater geographical extent and longer duration (approximately 46 kyr) of ocean anoxic event 1b suggest that processes leading to such ocean anoxic events in the North Atlantic and western Tethys were able to act over a much larger region, and sequester far more carbon, than any of the Quaternary sapropels.},

abstract = {Profiles of carbon isotopes were studied in marine limestones of Late Permian and Early Triassic age of the Tethyan region from 20 sections in Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Armenian SSR, Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and China. The Upper Permian sections continue the high positive values of delta13C previously found in Upper Permian basins in NW Europe and western USA. In the more complete sections of Tethys it can now be demonstrated that the values of delta13C drop from the Murgabian to the Dzhulfian Stages of the Upper Permian, then sharply to values near zero during the last two biozones of the Dorashamian. These levels of delta13C sample the Tethys Sea and the world ocean, and equal values from deep-water sediments at Salamis Greece indicate that they apply to the whole water column. We hypothesize that the high values of delta13C are a consequence of Late Paleozoic storage of organic carbon, and that the declines represent an episodic cessation of this organic deposition, and partial oxidation of the organic reservoir, extending over a period of several million years. The carbon isotope profile may reflect parallel complexity in the pattern of mass extinction in Late Permian time.},

@article{Soetaert2006,
abstract = {We investigated long-term trends (1965–2002) in dissolved inorganic nutrients in the tidal part of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium, The Netherlands). Annually averaged concentrations of dissolved silicate (DSi), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), and phosphate (DIP) increased significantly until the mid-1970s, after which they declined linearly at rates of 0.6, 2.9, and 0.3 umol L21 yr21, respectively. This co-occurred with a deterioration followed by a restoration of water column oxic conditions. Because of the differences in the reduction rate of DSi (1.2{\%} yr21), DIN (1.7{\%} yr21), and DIP (5.4{\%} yr21), the N: P and Si : P ratios more than doubled from 1980 to 2002. The Si :N ratio varied from 0.2 to 0.4 and was positively correlated with river discharge. The part downstream from the confluence of the main rivers was a net sink for DSi during the entire period but evolved from a net sink to a net source for DIP, while the reverse was true for DIN. This differential behavior of the estuary with respect to DIN and DIP strongly buffered the altered loadings to the upper estuary. The input of oxygen-consuming substances at the head of the estuary triggered a sequence of oxidation reactions. In the early 1970s, high loadings of ammonium and organic matter caused oxygen depletion and intense water-column denitrification in the upstream part and intense nitrification downstream, with a nitrate maximum succeeding a nitrite peak. With oxic conditions improving and the input of ammonium decreasing, water-column denitrification declined, the nitrification front migrated upstream, and the estuary evolved from a net producer of nitrite to a net consumer. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, nitrate behaves almost conservatively over the entire estuary.},

abstract = {New Late Triassic-earliest Jurassic magneto-biostratigraphic data have been obtained from three overlapping sections in the Southern Alps, Italy (Costa Imagna, Brumano, Italcementi Quarry), composed of {\~{}} 520 m of shallow-marine carbonates outcropping in stratigraphic continuity. Characteristic magnetic components of presumed depositional age record a sequence of 9 normal and reverse polarity magnetozones (as defined by at least three stratigraphically superposed samples) linked by conodont and palynofloral evidence from this study and the literature to Rhaetian to Triassic-Jurassic boundary age. This represents a significantly larger number of polarity zones than previously recognized in more condensed Rhaetian sections from the literature, and by inference represents more time. These data are placed in a broader Late Triassic temporal framework by means of correlations to published magneto-biostratigraphic data from the Tethyan marine Pizzo Mondello section and the Newark astronomical polarity time scale (APTS). This framework is consistent with a position of the Norian-Rhaetian boundary (as defined at Brumano and Pizzo Mondello by the first appearance of Misikella posthernsteini) within Newark magnetozones E17r-E19r in the {\~{}} 207-210 Ma time interval, in basic agreement with the position originally estimated in the Newark using pollen biostratigraphy (E18 at 208-209 Ma). This framework is also consistent with the position of the Triassic-Jurassic boundary interval (placed at Italcementi Quarry at the acme of Kraeuselisporites reissingeri coincident with a negative carbon isotope excursion) correlative to just above Newark magnetozone E23r and just below the oldest CAMP lavas dated at {\~{}} 202 Ma.

abstract = {The $\delta$18O of ostracod valves is widely used to infer water $\delta$18O and temperature. However, ostracod $\delta$18O appears sensitive to other environmental variables. In addition, there is species-dependent ostracod calcite 18O enrichment, relative to slowly precipitated inorganic calcite under the same conditions. Together these uncertainties complicate ostracod paleoclimate reconstructions. This study presents a new understanding of the causes of ostracod $\delta$18O variations based on a global database of published ostracod $\delta$18O values in lake, marine and coastal environments, and from culture experiments. The database includes associated field/experiment host water parameters including temperature (−1 to 32 °C), water $\delta$18O (−13.2‰ to 4.3‰ VSMOW), pH (6.9–10.4), salinity (0–72 g/kg), calcite saturation states (0.6–26), and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration [DIC] (0.9–54.3 mmol/kg). The data show that: (1) the $\delta$18O of marine and non-marine ostracods reflects the 18O/16O of the sum of host water CO32− and HCO3− ions. For example, at a given temperature, the $\delta$18O of non-marine ostracods decreases by 4‰ to 6‰ as [CO32−]/[DIC] reaches 70{\%}, depending on the ostracod species. In low [CO32−]/[DIC] settings (i.e. high HCO3−/CO32−), ostracod 18O/16O is close to the 18O/16O of HCO3− ions, which explains why on average ostracod $\delta$18O is higher than the $\delta$18O of inorganic calcite precipitated slowly under the same conditions. (2) Taxonomic offsets in ostracod $\delta$18O vary with the host water [CO32−]/[DIC]. In environments where HCO3− ≫ CO32− (i.e. most freshwater lakes), the 18O/16O of Candonids is indistinguishable from the 18O/16O of HCO3− ions (difference of 0.10 ± 0.16‰) while the 18O/16O of Cyprids is lower than the 18O/16O of HCO3− ions by −0.77‰ to −0.32‰, Cytherids by −0.88 ± 0.29‰, and Limnocytherids by −1.12 ± 0.05‰. (3) The sensitivity of ostracod $\delta$18O to [CO32−]/[DIC] also varies with taxonomy. For each percent increase in [CO32−]/[DIC], Candonids $\delta$18O decreases by −0.098 ± 0.024‰, Cyprids by −0.075 ± 0.004‰, Cytherids by −0.057 ± 0.012‰, and Limnocytherids by −0.058 ± 0.005‰. (4) The similarity in 18O/16O between ostracod calcite and the sum of host water ‘HCO3− and CO32−' (despite species-specific offsets) suggests rapid precipitation of a finite DIC pool in the ostracod calcifying fluid. We propose an ostracod $\delta$18O model whereby the more negative the 18O/16O of a given species relative to the sum of CO32− and HCO3−, the greater the isotopic equilibrium between the DIC pool and H2O in the ostracod calcifying fluid. (5) Higher host water salinities and pH induce higher [CO32−]/[DIC], resulting in lower ostracod $\delta$18O, which explains the variable salinity and pH effects on ostracod $\delta$18O. Our database and ostracod $\delta$18O model shows that ostracod $\delta$18O records from closed basin environments likely reflect high or variable [CO32−]/[DIC], rather than water temperature and $\delta$18O alone. Our study reconciles contradictory observations of controls on ostracod $\delta$18O and paves the way for improved paleo-environmental interpretations and reconstructions of past water [CO32−]/[DIC].},

abstract = {Reduced sulfur accumulation in Holocene and latest Pleistocene euxinic marine sediments from the Cariaco Basin, Venezuela, was investigated to constrain the timing and possible pathways of organic matter (OM) sulfurization. Data were collected for a diverse suite of sulfur species, including concentrations and sulfur isotope compositions of pore-water sulfide, pore-water sulfate, pyrite sulfur, total organic sulfur (TOS), kerogen sulfur (KS), and polar bitumen sulfur (PBS). Results suggest that there was a period during which almost no diagenetic pyrite formed in the sediments of the Cariaco, coincident with a shift from high to lower sedimentation rates and a concomitant change in the delivery of organic matter to the sediments. The sulfur isotope composition of organic matter was predicted based on assumed pathways using weighted isotopic mass balance calculations and compared to measured isotope values for organic sulfur. These results indicate that organic sulfur is derived primarily from pore-water sulfide, with minor contributions from primary bio-sulfur (e.g., in proteins derived from algae and bacteria). The predicted sulfur isotope values of organic sulfur compounds (OSC) suggest that pore-water sulfide is the ultimate source of reduced sulfur for incorporation into organic matter. It is possible, however, that reactive sulfur intermediates such as elemental sulfur or polysulfides react directly with organic matter. These intermediate sulfur species are likely formed through partial oxidation of sulfide by anaerobic sulfide-oxidizing microbes living in the sediments. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 CSIC. The aim of this work was to assess the uptake of Fe(II) by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from the acidophilic bacterium Acidiphillium 3.2Sup(5). These EPS were extracted using EDTA. EPS of A. 3.2Sup(5) loaded in sorption tests with Fe(II), were characterized using the following experimental techniques: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The experimental results indicate that EPS adsorb ferrous iron according to Freundlich model with a metal sorption uptake of K = 1.14 mg 1-1/n L 1/n g -1 and a sorption intensity of 1/n = 1.26. In addition, ferrous iron sorption by EPS took place by preferential interaction with the carboxyl group which promotes the formation of ferrous iron oxalates (FeC 2 O 4 ). Since the interaction reaction was reversible (Log K = 0.77 ± 0.33), that means that the cation sorption can be reversed at convenience. Copyright:},

abstract = {Latest Permian to the Middle Triassic mixed siliciclastic-carbonate shelf deposits of the northern Gondwana margin have been studied in four sections (Nammal, Chhidru, Chitta-Landu, and Narmia) in the Salt Range and Surghar Range of Pakistan. Sedimentological and palynofacies patterns combined with a high resolution ammonoid based age control have been used to assess environmental changes such as sea-level change, distance from the shore, and oxygenation conditions of the sections in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. The base and the top of the Early Triassic are marked by second order sequence boundaries (SRT1, SRT8). Within the Early Triassic two third order sequence boundaries could be delineated by means of palynofacies analysis and sedimentology, one near the Dienerian-Smithian (SRT2) and the second one near the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SRT5). The extinction event at the Smithian-Spathian boundary seems to be closely associated to the latter globally recorded sea-level low stand. Five additional sequences of undetermined order (SRT3, SRT 4, SRT5/1, SRT6, and SRT7) are reflected in the sedimentological record of the studied sections. The observed changes in the composition of the particulate organic matter (POM) indicate a general shallowing upward trend, which is modulated by smaller transgressive-regressive cycles supporting the sedimentologically defined sequences. The POM is mostly dominated by terrestrial phytoclasts and sporomorphs. The strongest marine signal is reflected by increased abundance of amorphous organic matter (AOM) in the lower part of the Ceratite Marls at Nammal (late Dienerian) and Chhidru (earliest Smithian) and the Lower Ceratite Limestone at Chitta-Landu (late Dienerian). AOM of marine origin is characteristic for deeper, distal basinal settings and is preferentially preserved under dysoxic and anoxic conditions, indicating reduced oxygen conditions during these intervals. Up-section transgressive events are reflected by increased numbers of acritarchs, reaching up to 50{\%} of the POM. Well oxygenated conditions and low total organic carbon contents (TOC) continue up to the top of the Early Triassic (Mianwali Formation). The most pronounced terrestrial influx is expressed in the Middle Triassic. Organic carbon isotope data parallel the carbonate carbon isotope records from the Tethyan realm; therefore, they reflect real global changes in the carbon cycle independent of the OM composition. The biomarker study of the apolar hydrocarbons of three samples from the Nammal section indicates an enhanced bacterial productivity, especially in the Smithian and Spathian, reflected in high relative abundances of hopanes. POM, TOC data and redox sensitive biomarkers together with high resolution biostratigraphy demonstrate that well-oxygenated environmental conditions prevailed in the Early Triassic with the exception of the Dienerian to earliest Smithian interval. The POM assemblages of Late Permian to late Griesbachian age indicate well oxygenated conditions during this time interval. There is no evidence in support of an anoxic event in the late Griesbachian in these sections.},

abstract = {Methane on Mars is a topic of special interest because of its potential association with microbial life. The variable detections of methane by the Curiosity rover, orbiters, and terrestrial telescopes, coupled with methane's short lifetime in the martian atmosphere, may imply an active gas source in the planet's subsurface, with migration and surface emission processes similar to those known on Earth as "gas seepage." Here, we review the variety of subsurface processes that could result in methane seepage on Mars. Such methane could originate from abiotic chemical reactions, thermogenic alteration of abiotic or biotic organic matter, and ancient or extant microbial metabolism. These processes can occur over a wide range of temperatures, in both sedimentary and igneous rocks, and together they enhance the possibility that significant amounts of methane could have formed on early Mars. Methane seepage to the surface would occur preferentially along faults and fractures, through focused macro-seeps and/or diffuse microseepage exhalations. Our work highlights the types of features on Mars that could be associated with methane release, including mud-volcano-like mounds in Acidalia or Utopia; proposed ancient springs in Gusev Crater, Arabia Terra, and Valles Marineris; and rims of large impact craters. These could have been locations of past macro-seeps and may still emit methane today. Microseepage could occur through faults along the dichotomy or fractures such as those at Nili Fossae, Cerberus Fossae, the Argyre impact, and those produced in serpentinized rocks. Martian microseepage would be extremely difficult to detect remotely yet could constitute a significant gas source. We emphasize that the most definitive detection of methane seepage from different release candidates would be best provided by measurements performed in the ground or at the ground-atmosphere interface by landers or rovers and that the technology for such detection is currently available.},

abstract = {We report on the iron-sulfur systematics and S-isotopic compositions of upper Paleoproterozoic carbonaceous shales from the Wollogorang and lower Reward formations, McArthur Basin, northern Australia. Iron speciation in these rocks is similar to that of modern euxinic Black Sea sediments and distinct from sediments depositing from oxygenated water, providing persuasive evidence of euxinic depositional environments in a mid-Proterozoic marine basin. High values of Degree of Pyritization (DOP) also indicate anoxic bottom-water conditions at the time of shale deposition as does the relatively uniform isotopic composition of sedimentary sulfides. The isotopic composition of the sulfides is, however, quite enriched in 34 S and for the lower Reward Formation similar to contemporaneous seawater sulfate. These 34 S-enriched sulfides are consistent with extensive, or even complete, sulfate depletion within the euxinic basins in which the sediments were deposited. Based on analogy with modern euxinic environments and further constrained by model results, middle Proterozoic seawater sulfate concentrations were probably within the range of 0.5 to 2.4 mM. Taken together, our results indicate a relatively low-sulfate late Paleoproterozoic ocean and sulfidic deep waters in the McArthur seaway, a condition that could have encompassed much larger regions of the ocean.},

abstract = {Sub-arctic Cretaceous (Berriasian-late Valanginian, ca. 145-134 Ma) marine temperatures obtained from fossil mollusks (belemnites) are determined using carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, an approach based on the "clumping" of 13C and 18O in the carbonate mineral lattice into bonds with each other. From our analyses we infer sub-arctic Early Cretaceous marine temperatures ranging from 10 {\{}degrees{\}}C to 20 {\{}degrees{\}}C. These possibly seasonally biased, warm sub-arctic temperatures are warmer than present mean summer water temperatures at 60-65{\{}degrees{\}}N and are therefore consistent with a warmer "greenhouse" world featuring a shallow (equable) latitudinal temperature gradient. Our combined temperature and {\{}delta{\}}18Obelemnite data imply seawater {\{}delta{\}}18O values that have a remarkably modern character in that they are similar to modern high-latitude seawater but more positive than modeled Cretaceous seawater. We identify a cooler late Valanginian interval (ca. 134 Ma) with temperatures consistent with polar regions a few degrees above freezing and also coincident with increased {\{}delta{\}}18O seawater values. Thus we find evidence of intervals when polar ice was unlikely, and also when polar ice was plausible. Both scenarios support the view of generally warm but dynamic polar climates during greenhouse intervals that were punctuated by periods of ice growth.},

abstract = {The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) has long been proposed as having a causal relationship with the end-Triassic extinction event (∼201.5 Ma). In North America and northern Africa, CAMP is preserved as multiple basaltic units interbedded with uppermost Triassic to lowermost Jurassic sediments. However, it has been unclear whether this apparent pulsing was a local feature, or if pulses in the intensity of CAMP volcanism characterized the emplacement of the province as a whole. Here, six geographically widespread Triassic-Jurassic records, representing varied paleoenvironments, are analyzed for mercury (Hg) concentrations and Hg/total organic carbon (Hg/TOC) ratios. Volcanism is a major source of mercury to the modern environment. Clear increases in Hg and Hg/TOC are observed at the end-Triassic extinction horizon, confirming that a volcanically induced global Hg cycle perturbation occurred at that time. The established correlation between the extinction horizon and lowest CAMP basalts allows this sedimentary Hg excursion to be stratigraphically tied to a specific flood basalt unit, strengthening the case for volcanic Hg as the driver of sedimentary Hg/TOC spikes. Additional Hg/TOC peaks are also documented between the extinction horizon and the Triassic-Jurassic boundary (separated by ∼200 ky), supporting pulsatory intensity of CAMP volcanism across the entire province and providing direct evidence for episodic volatile release during the initial stages of CAMP emplacement. Pulsatory volcanism, and associated perturbations in the ocean-atmosphere system, likely had profound implications for the rate and magnitude of the end-Triassic mass extinction and subsequent biotic recovery.},

abstract = {In order to reveal environmental changes across the Permo-Triassic boundary (PTB), the detailed lithostratigraphy of the PTB interval is analyzed at Chaotian in northern Sichuan, China. The studied section is composed of the Changhsingian (Upper Permian) Dalong Formation and the Induan (Lower Triassic) Feixianguan Formation of a lower-slope facies deposited on the northwestern margin of the Yangtze carbonate platform. The 12-m-thick interval across the PTB consists mainly of bedded carbonates and mudstone, and is lithologically divided into 7 units, i.e., Units A to G, in ascending order. The main extinction horizon of Permian taxa is recognized at the Unit D/E boundary where various fossil metazoans and protists, such as ammonoids, brachiopods, bivalves, conodonts, and radiolarians, rapidly disappeared or became scarce. The complete disappearance of radiolarians at the Unit D/E boundary emphasizes that the PTB extinction affected not only various Late Permian benthic and free-swimming metazoans but also planktonic protozoans. The lowest Induan index conodont Hindeodus parvus first occurs at the base of Unit F, marking the biostratigraphically defined PTB horizon. Unit E composed of unique bedded marl between the main extinction horizon and the first occurrence of Triassic taxon represents a period of strong environmental stresses that suppressed productivity both of silica- and carbonate-secreting organisms. By changing their size, radiolarians reacted most sensitively to the environmental change that already started in the late Changhsingian, appreciably before the final extinction event. The frequent intercalation of rhyo-dacitic tuff beds, particularly in Unit D and the lower part of Unit E across the main extinction horizon, suggests that intermittent felsic volcanism and relevant environmental change may have been responsible for the mass extinction of the Permian taxa and for the prolonged post-extinction lag time before the initial recovery. The frequent ash falls during the late Changhsingian indicate that the volcanism-induced environmental change had already started earlier than the main extinction. All the biological production (carbonate, silica, and organic matter) collapsed at the Unit D/E boundary when the environmental stresses may have passed a critical threshold for maintaining ecological stability. The PTB interval between the extinction and the first appearance of Triassic taxon at Chaotian is ca. 1.4 m thick, apparently almost eight times thicker than that at the Global Stratotype Section and Point of PTB in Meishan (19 cm). The Chaotian section, as well as the neighboring Shangsi section in northern Sichuan, may provide a better chance for high-resolution chemostratigraphic analyses that may allow detection and correlation of subtle environmental changes across the PTB.},

abstract = {Detailed fluorescent microscopic observations and organic geochemical analyses for insoluble sedimentary organic matter (kerogens) are conducted on the end-Permian to earliest Triassic sediments in the Meishan section A of South China. The main objectives of the present study are to reconstruct variations of marine and terrestrial environments, and to evaluate bulk characteristics of terrestrial input in the palaeo-Tethys ocean for the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB). Most of kerogens in the Meishan section are mainly composed of marine algae-derived amorphous organic matter, while terrestrial plant-derived amorphous organic matter is remarkably dominant in the mass extinction horizon reported previously. The relative abundances of marine organic matter may vary depending on marine production rather than terrestrial input in the palaeo-Tethys associated with changing terrestrial vegetation. We also identified aromatic furans as major compounds in kerogen pyrolysate of all layers. It is possible that sources of aromatic furans with alkyl group, fungi and lichen, proliferated as disaster biota in terrestrial ecosystem through the PTB. Higher abundances of herbaceous organic matter are observed in the layers above the mass extinction horizon. However, the conifer biomarker retene can be identified in kerogen pyrolysates of all layers. These results imply that the productions of herbaceous plants increased as dominant pioneer biota in early stage of recovery for terrestrial ecosystem after its collapse, but also that woody plant potentially continued to be produced in land area throughout the end-Permian and earliest-Triassic.},

abstract = {Basal Triassic carbonates of the Gerennav{\'{a}}r Formation (B{\"{u}}kk Mountains, Northern Hungary) were studied. The succession was deposited in an open marine deep ramp environment of the western Tethys, and can be divided into three parts on the basis of the dominant microfacies. The lowermost 0.5 m-thick interval is made up by thin-bedded and bioturbated mudstones which contain ostracods and Earlandia along with relict skeletal fragments. The successive 8 m-thick deposits consist of planar stromatolites with well-preserved microfabrics. The most characteristic microfabric elements are sphere clusters in a dense micrite groundmass, bushy aggregates of micrite clots, bundles of prostrate micrite threads, and peloids. The formation of the spheres and the surrounding dense micrite is attributed to calcification of a coccoid-cyanobacteria dominated mat community. The tufted micrite clot clusters crudely resemble Angusticellularia. A filamentous microbial origin is likely for the thread bundles. The peloids are interpreted either as reworked pieces of calcified mat, or rolled microbial clumps. The reduced preservation of microfabric components in the upper unit refers to less favourable condition for mat development which is probable due to deepening of the depositional environment. The overlying mudstone unit is very poor in fossils. The preservation of microbial microfabrics in the stromatolites indicates that early lithification by carbonate precipitation was widespread and intense even in open marine environments following the end-Permian boundary events. This supports the assumption that significant changes took place in geochemistry of seawater during the Late Permian-Early Triassic time interval. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Biological activity is a major factor in Earth's chemical cycles, including facilitating CO2 sequestration and providing climate feedbacks. Thus a key question in Earth's evolution is when did life arise and impact hydrosphere–atmosphere–lithosphere chemical cycles? Until now, evidence for the oldest life on Earth focused on debated stable isotopic signatures of 3,800–3,700 million year (Myr)-old metamorphosed sedimentary rocks and minerals from the Isua supracrustal belt (ISB), southwest Greenland. Here we report evidence for ancient life from a newly exposed outcrop of 3,700-Myr-old metacarbonate rocks in the ISB that contain 1–4-cm-high stromatolites—macroscopically layered structures produced by microbial communities. The ISB stromatolites grew in a shallow marine environment, as indicated by seawater-like rare-earth element plus yttrium trace element signatures of the metacarbonates, and by interlayered detrital sedimentary rocks with cross-lamination and storm-wave generated breccias. The ISB stromatolites predate by 220 Myr the previous most convincing and generally accepted multidisciplinary evidence for oldest life remains in the 3,480-Myr-old Dresser Formation of the Pilbara Craton, Australia. The presence of the ISB stromatolites demonstrates the establishment of shallow marine carbonate production with biotic CO2 sequestration by 3,700 million years ago (Ma), near the start of Earth's sedimentary record. A sophistication of life by 3,700 Ma is in accord with genetic molecular clock studies placing life's origin in the Hadean eon ( {\textgreater} 4,000 Ma).},

abstract = {We developed a plate tectonic model for the Paleozoic and Mesozoic (Ordovician to Cretaceous) integrating dynamic plate boundaries, plate buoyancy, ocean spreading rates and major tectonic and magmatic events. Plates were constructed through time by adding/removing oceanic material, symbolized by synthetic isochrons, to major continents and terranes. Driving forces like slab pull and slab buoyancy were used to constrain the evolution of paleo-oceanic domains. This approach offers good control of sea-floor spreading and plate kinematics. This new method represents a distinct departure from classical continental drift reconstructions, which are not constrained, due to the lack of plate boundaries. This model allows a more comprehensive analysis of the development of the Tethyan realm in space and time. In particular, the relationship between the Variscan and the Cimmerian cycles in the Mediterranean-Alpine realm is clearly illustrated by numerous maps. For the Alpine cycle, the relationship between the Alpides senso stricto and the Tethysides is also explicable in terms of plate tectonic development of the Alpine Tethys-Atlantic domain versus the NeoTethys domain.},

abstract = {Carbonate diagenetic models have been heavily influenced by numerous studies of exposed Quaternary limestones. As a result, meteoric diagenesis is often assumed to be the principle means of altering aragonite-rich sediments into calcitic limestones. However, these models are limited by the scarcity of examples of aragonite-rich sediments buried in seawater that have never been influenced by meteoric fluids. The Bahamas transect cores recovered originally aragonite-rich sediments deposited in deep water beyond the easy reach of meteoric waters and provide an opportunity to test current diagenetic paradigms. The Bahamas transect consists of seven cores drilled in the prograding western margin of Great Bahama Bank. The two proximal cores (Clino and Unda) were drilled on the platform top and recovered shallow-water platform to reef facies overlying deeper margin and proximal slope facies. The five distal cores were drilled by ODP Leg 166 in up to 660 m of water and recovered carbonate slope facies. All studied sections are Neogene to Pleistocene in age. Diagenetic environments were identified based on petrographic and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations, XRD mineralogy, carbon and oxygen stable isotopic data, and trace elements. The upper 100-150 m of the two proximal cores were altered in meteoric to mixing-zone diagenetic environments but all other intervals were altered exclusively in marine pore fluids during seafloor, marine-burial, and deep-burial diagenesis. Several of the findings of this study question current carbonate diagenetic paradigms. These include: (1) large-scale sea level lowstands may not have chemically active meteoric lenses as we found no meteoric alteration at the -120 m elevation of the latest Pleistocene lowstand. Rather, phreatic meteoric diagenesis appears restricted to within approximate to10 m of the land surface. (2) Mixing-zone diagenesis includes aragonite dissolution and minor LMC cementation but does not show the cavernous porosity or dolomitization predicted by mixing-zone diagenetic models. Current models are based on coastal mixing zones, which do not appear to be applicable to these more inland, and perhaps more typical, locations. (3) Marine-burial diagenesis produces a mature limestone with fabrics formerly considered diagnostic for meteoric diagenesis such as moldic porosity, aragonite neomorphism, blocky calcite spar and calcite microspar. However, oxygen stable isotopic data (average delta(18)O = +1parts per thousand) indicate alteration in marine pore fluids only. The character of marine-burial diagenesis is partially controlled by the nature of the sediment being altered. We have identified two end-member styles, an open-system style characterized by dissolution of aragonite without significant cementation and a more closed-system style with aragonite dissolution accompanied by calcite cementation. The sediments examined were deposited well above the aragonite compensation depth, so seawater entering the sediment is saturated with respect to aragonite. The under-saturation needed to drive diagenesis is likely the result of bacterial oxidation of organic matter using sulfate. (4) Microspar forms in these sediments as a cement based on petrographic and SEM examination of partly to completely altered samples. This contradicts the common assumption that microspar forms by aggrading neomorphism of micrite. (5) Strontium content of sediments altered in marine pore fluids can show an extreme range of values, formerly thought to indicate different environments. The opportunity to finally examine the diagenesis of aragonite-rich sediments buried in seawater challenges current diagenetic paradigms and emphasizes the importance of integrated studies.

abstract = {The term 'stromatolite' was proposed by Kalkowsky (1908. Z. dt. geol. Ges. 60, 68-125) for structures he discovered in the carbonates of the Lower Triassic Buntsandstein of the Harz Mountains in central Germany. We have re-examined these localities to clarify Kalkowsky's descriptions and to deduce the environmental conditions of stromatolitic growth. The Lower Buntsandstein was deposited in a closed lacustrine basin, the Central European Permo-Triassic Basin. The depositional environment was a playa lake with variable salinity. In the centre of the basin oolite beds are intercalated in the mainly siliciclastic succession which is composed of {\textgreater}20 fining upward cycles thought to have been produced by climatic variations. Stromatolites occur almost exclusively on the surface of oolite beds. Stromatolitic structures consist of millimetre-thick laminated crusts and centimetre-high branching columnar forms. Smaller and bigger ({\textgreater}2 m high) domes are composed of secondary order columns and intercalated crusts. Occasionally, upper surfaces of the domes are pitted due to syndepositional dissolution. Despite of the overall intense sparitization, two groups of stromatolitic microstructures can be distinguished, spongy-fenestrate and fan-like fabrics. The spongy-fenestrate fabric is similar to that one caused by the recent cyanobacteria Phormidium, Calothrix and Dichothrix, and the fan-like fabric to Rivularia. Laminated crusts called stromatoid by Kalkowsky are interpreted as being of cement origin and formed by quick precipitation. The change from columnar to domical forms may reflect changes of hydrodynamic conditions. Clear photoautotrophism suggests that cyanobacteria or eukaryotes were the dominant organisms involved in the formation of Kalkowsky's stromatolites. Influx of ooids or siliciclastic mud interrupted or terminated the stromatolitic growth. The morphology, growth pattern and fabrics of stromatolites were most likely controlled by ecological factors which all seem to be related to the general hydro-climatic evolution of the Lower Buntsandstein.

abstract = {One of the five largest mass extinctions of the past 600million years occurred at the boundary of the Triassic and Jurassic periods, 201.6million years ago. The loss of marine biodiversity at the time has been linked to extreme greenhouse warming, triggered by the release of carbon dioxide from flood basalt volcanism in the central Atlantic Ocean. In contrast, the biotic turnover in terrestrial ecosystems is not well understood, and cannot be readily reconciled with the effects of massive volcanism. Here we present pollen, spore and geochemical analyses across the Triassic/Jurassic boundary from three drill cores from Germany and Sweden. We show that gymnosperm forests in northwest Europe were transiently replaced by fern and fern-associated vegetation, a pioneer assemblage commonly found in disturbed ecosystems. The Triassic/Jurassic boundary is also marked by an enrichment of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which, in the absence of charcoal peaks, we interpret as an indication of incomplete combustion of organic matter by ascending flood basalt lava. We conclude that the terrestrial vegetation shift is so severe and wide ranging that it is unlikely to have been triggered by greenhouse warming alone. Instead, we suggest that the release of pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and toxic compounds such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons may have contributed to the extinction.},

@article{Huang2007,
abstract = {By combining the carbon cycle model with the records of carbonate and organic (kerogen) carbon isotope, this paper presents the calculation of the fraction of organic carbon burial (f org) of beds 23-40 at the global boundary stratotype section and point (GSSP) of the Permian-Triassic boundary at Meishan, Zhejiang Province. The resulting calculation produces two episodes of f org maxima observed to occur at beds 23-24 and 27-29, which respectively corresponds to the two episodic anoxic events indicated by the flourish of green sulfur bacteria. Two episodic forg minima occurred at beds 25-26 and 32-34, generally coincident with the flourish of cyanobacteria (bed 26 and upper part of beds 29 to 34) as shown by the high value of 2-melthyhopnoanes. It appears that the forg is related to the redox conditions, with greater forg values observed under the reductive condition. The relationship between forg and the total organic carbon (TOC) content was complex. The forg value was low at some beds with a high TOC content (such as bed 26), while high observed at some beds with a low TOC content (e.g. bed 27). This association infers the important contribution of primary productivity to the TOC content. The original organic burial could be thus calculated through the configuration of the function of the primary productivity and forg, which can be used to correct the residual TOC measured today. This investigation indicates that compiling the organic-inorganic carbon isotopes with the carbon cycle model favors to understand the fraction of organic carbon burial, providing information for the reconstruction of the coupling among biota, environments and organic burial. {\textcopyright} Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag 2007.},

The boundaries of the major terranes are considered and defined. Six new palaeogeographical maps at 30 Ma intervals, which ensure kinematic continuity, are presented for this period. The palaeomagnetic data are very useful for positioning terranes for the present-day North Atlantic area, of variable value for China and Tarim, and for much of the large superterrane of Gondwana (being notably poor during the Early Devonian and the Early Carboniferous), and are sparse or non-existent for much of the rest of Asia. The relative positions of Laurussia and Gondwana at the end of the Palaeozoic when they united to form Pangaea are discussed, and it is concluded that the most convincing reconstruction (Pangaea A) is obtained by assuming an octupole contribution of 10–15{\%} in combination with the main dipole of the Earth's magnetic field. As well as faunal and palaeomagnetic data, the disposition of the major sediment types, including coal deposits, evaporites and glacial deposits, has also been considered, especially in the late Carboniferous and Permian.},

In particular, we highlight a Mid-Mesozoic Revolution in the nature and location of carbonate deposition in the marine environment, driven by the ecological success of calcareous plankton. This drove the creation of a responsive deep-sea sedimentary sink of CaCO3. The result is that biologically driven carbonate deposition provides a significant buffering of ocean chemistry and of atmospheric CO2 in the modern system. However, the same calcifying organisms that under-pin the deep-sea carbonate sink are now threatened by the continued atmospheric release of fossil fuel CO2 and increasing acidity of the surface ocean. We are not yet in a position to predict what the impact on CaCO3 production will be, or how the uptake of fossil fuel CO2 by the ocean will be affected. This uncertainty in the future trajectory of atmospheric CO2 that comes from incomplete understanding of the marine carbonate cycle is cause for concern.},

abstract = {The oldest known seep deposits with macroinvertebrate taxa are Devonian in age. Although more and more examples continue to be discovered, the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic record of methane-seeps is still fragmentary. The relationship of ancient carbonate deposits to methane seepage is established by (i) the geological setting and structural features, (ii) the occurrence of low diversity but high abundance faunal assemblages, (iii) carbonate fabrics, (iv) low $\delta$13C values of early diagenetic carbonate phases, and (v) characteristic 13C-depleted biomarkers. In this review, special emphasis is placed on biogeochemical processes at ancient methane-seeps. Specific carbonate fabrics and phases include, in order of decreasing significance for seep-dominated environments, (i) inverted stromatactoid cavities, (ii) upside-down stromatolites, (iii) globular fabrics, (iv) botryoidal aragonite, (v) micritic nodules, (vi) fractures, (vii) clotted micrites, and (viii) constructive seams representing fossilised biofilms. The carbon of the early diagenetic carbonate phases was derived predominantly from the oxidation of methane which resulted in low $\delta$13C values. Pyrites enclosed in the seep limestones generally show low $\delta$34S values and a significant variability of their isotopic composition on a small scale, both indicating bacterial sulphate reduction as the sulphide-supplying process. 13C-depleted lipid biomarkers characterise the microbial populations involved in the cycling of carbon at ancient methane-seeps. Typical compounds include isoprene-based lipids from archaea, and linear and monomethyl-branched carbon skeletons assigned to sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), consistent with the syntrophic relationship of these microbes in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The core covers the late Holocene period with high overall sedimentation rate of ?573 cm kyr21. Pore fluid chemical analyses indicate that the depth of the present sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ) is at ?6 mbsf. The (DTA1 DCa1DMg)/DSO22 4 ratios suggest that both organoclastic degradation and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) drive sulfate reduction at the study site. The positive correlation between total organic carbon content (TOC) and chro- mium reducible sulfur (CRS) content indicates marked influence of organoclastic sulfate reduction on sulfid- ization. Coupled occurrence of 34S-enriched iron sulfide (pyrite) with 12C-enriched authigenic carbonate zones is the possible records of paleo-sulfate methane transition zones where AOM-driven-focused sulfate reduction was likely fueled by sustained high methane flux from underlying gas-rich zone. Aluminum nor- malized poorly reactive iron (FePR/Al) and La/Yb ratios suggest increasing contribution from Deccan basalts relative to that of Archean-Proterozoic granitic complex in sediment flux of Krishna-Godavari basin during the last 4 kyr. 1.},

abstract = {The global carbon cycle experienced a major perturbation during the Permian-Triassic transition, reflected inter alia in a large increase in the vertical (shallow-to-deep) gradient of carbonate ??13C (??13Ccarb) in Early Triassic seas. However, the effect of this perturbation on the vertical gradient of organic matter ??13C in seawater (??13Corg) is less known to date. Here, we examine geographic and secular variations in ??13Corg in Late Permian-Early Triassic seas of the South China craton and their implications for contemporaneous changes in microbial community composition and paleoredox conditions. Vertical ??13Corg gradients document the existence of a narrow and relatively shallow oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ) within the open-ocean Northern Deepwater Basin (NDW) and a deeper and thicker OMZ within the semi-restricted Nanpanjiang Basin (NPJB). For the pre-extinction interval, ??13Corg gradients between the shallow and intermediate watermasses of the NDB and between the shallow and deep watermasses of the NPJB record contributions to the sediment of organic matter from bacteria living below the ocean-surface layer. These bacteria were mainly anaerobic chemoautotrophs that inhabited suboxic to anoxic waters of an OMZ and that produced more strongly 13C-depleted organic matter than surface-water eukaryotic algae, thus increasing ??13Corg. For the post-extinction interval, a reversed ??13Corg in the NDB is attributed to blooms of green sulfur bacteria or other anaerobic photoautotrophic bacteria that were resident in a deep chlorophyll maximum layer and that had smaller carbon isotopic fractionation than surface-water algae. Although quantitatively important in intermediate- to deep-water areas during the Early Triassic, such bacteria were absent in coeval shallow-water sections, reflecting water-depth controls on microbial community composition. A concurrent flatting of the ??13Corg gradient in the NPJB was caused by a return of oxic conditions and/or a decline of primary productivity in the surface ocean. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Carbon and oxygen isotopic analyses have been performed on live-stained aragonitic and calcitic benthic foraminifera and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) from the Southern California Borderland to examine carbon isotopic fractionation in foraminifera. Temperature, salinity and pH data have also been collected to permit accurate determination of the $\delta$13C of bicarbonate ion and thus aragonite-HCO3and calcite-HCO-3isotopic enrichment factors ($\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}ar-band $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}cl-b, respectively). Only species which precipitate in18O equilibrium have been considered. $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}ar-bvalues based on Hoeglundina elegans range from 1.9{\%}. at 2.7°C to 1.1{\%}. at 9.5°C. Only the lower temperature values agree with a tentative carbon isotope equilibrium equation for aragonite based on the data of Rubinson and Clayton (1969) and Emrich et al. (1970). The temperature dependence of $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}ar-bis considerably greater than the equilibrium equation would predict and may be due to a vital effect. The calcitic foraminifera Cassidulina tortuosa, Cassidulina braziliensis, and Cassidulina limbata, Bank and Terrace dwellers, have similar $\delta$13C values and yield an average $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}cl-bvalue of -0.2 ± .1{\%}. between 8° and 10°C. Calcitic Uvigerina curticosta, Uvigerina peregrina, and megalospheric B. argentea, Slope and Basin dwellers, are -0.7 ± .1{\%}. enriched relative to ambient bicarbonate for 3 to 9°C. No temperature dependence for $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}cl-bwas observed for the species in either habitat. The $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}cl-bvalues for Cassidulina species are close (± 0.3{\%}.) to the values given by the tentative equilibrium curve for calcite, while Uvigerina and Bolivina species give values 0.2-0.8{\%}. less. The $\epsilon${\{}lunate{\}}cl-bdifference between the Cassidulina species and the Uvigerina and Bolivina species is attributed to the incorporation of13C-depleted pore water DIC by the latter group rather than to taxonomic or temperature differences. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {The quality of palaeoenvironmental reconstructions based on macrofossil carbonate critically depends on preservation of the shell material because post-depositional processes can modify its structural, chemical and isotopic composition, potentially overprinting or completely erasing palaeoenvironmental information. A suite of methods can be employed to evaluate the impact of diagenetic processes on the primary geochemical signatures of samples. Here we review the benefits and shortcomings of the most commonly employed optical (optical microscopy, cathodoluminescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy) and chemical (trace element abundances, isotopic ratios) screening techniques used to assess the alteration degree of low-Mg calcite macrofossils and summarize the findings on diagenetic trends observed for elemental and isotopic systems in such materials. For a robust evaluation of the preservation state of biogenic calcite, it is advisable to combine a set of complementary techniques. Absolute limiting values of element and isotope ratios for discarding diagenetically altered materials cannot be universally applied, but should rather be evaluated on a case to case basis. The evaluation can be improved by analyses of diagenetic carbonate and altered fossil materials, which help constraining the diagenetic trajectories in the sampled specimens. Quantification of post-depositional alteration is possible, but in most cases the complexity$\backslash$nof diagenetic systems hampers the possibility of retrieving original proxy values for palaeoenvironmental reconstructions from partially altered materials.},

abstract = {Stratigraphic completeness is a fundamental consideration when deciphering the mass accumulation history of sediments and the geologic record of earth and ocean processes. In this study, stratigraphic completeness was examined in the context of late Holocene sedimentary successions using published sediment accumulation rates for five ocean margin systems (Amazon shelf, Hudson estuary, northern California shelf, Mid-Atlantic slope, Santa Monica Bay). Plots of mass accumulation rate versus time span of averaging were used to determine how rates scale with measurement period, and to estimate levels of stratigraphic completeness for comparison within and among margin systems. Statistically significant inverse correlations between accumulation rate and time span of averaging are indicated for all but one of these systems-most of the sedimentary records examined are stratigraphically incomplete. At the 103-yr level of resolution, completeness is 20-48{\%} for strongly tidal estuarine (Hudson estuary) and deltaic shelf (Amazon shelf) sites, 51-91{\%} for accretionary shelves (northern California shelf) and slopes (Mid-Atlantic slope), and 85-100{\%} for a sediment-starved slope (Santa Monica bay). Mass accumulation rates converge to a relatively narrow range (0.01-0.1 g cm-2yr-1) at the 104-yr level of resolution, consistent with the notion that there are universal controls on sediment accumulation rate, i.e., rate of sea-level rise and sediment supply. Among sites on the Amazon and northern California shelves, within-system completeness varies by ∼10-20{\%} on account of site-specific sedimentary processes that preferentially trap or disperse suspended sediment. Overall, stratigraphic completeness increases with water depth shelf-to-slope, yet depth is not a robust predictor of completeness in general owing to differences in strata-forming processes among shallow-marine environments. Significantly, completeness varies inversely with instantaneous deposition rate as the most sediment-rich systems tend to exhibit the most incomplete sedimentary records. The findings of this study emphasize the importance of considering time span and fidelity when interpreting the accumulation history of modern and Holocene sedimentary strata. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, observational limitations have hindered a direct evaluation of model-projected changes in extreme precipitation. We used satellite observations and model simulations to examine the response of tropical precipitation events to naturally driven changes in surface temperature and atmospheric moisture content. These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.},

Accumulation of oxygen requires organic matter burial in sediments, which is largely controlled by the sheltering or preservational effects of detrital clay minerals in modern marine continental margin depocenters. Here, we show mineralogical and geochemical evidence for an increase in clay mineral deposition in the Neoproterozoic that immediately predated the first metazoans. Today most clay minerals originate in biologically active soils, so initial expansion of a primitive land biota would greatly enhance production of pedogenic clay minerals (the "clay mineral factory"), leading to increased marine burial of organic carbon via mineral surface preservation.},

This revealed the skeleton of a 28-year-old adult male woolly mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius), largely complete except for the cranium, the partial skeletons of four or five juveniles in the age range 3–6 years, plus sparse remains of a subadult individual. The adult skeleton bears several traces of pathology, particularly a badly fractured but re-healed scapula. The presence of blowfly puparia within bone cavities, together with other environmental data and a consideration of mammoth biology, allow a detailed reconstruction of the taphonomy of the skeletons, which appear to have become mired within the kettle-hole.

abstract = {Landscapes change because they are the expression of the dynamic interaction between natural and cultural forces in the environment. Cultural landscapes are the result of consecutive reorganization of the land in order to adapt its use and spatial structure better to the changing societal demands. Particularly in Europe, history has recorded many successive and even devastating landscape changes, which have left barely any relics today. Today, the changes are seen as a menace, as a negative evolution because they cause a loss of diversity, coherence and identity, which were characteristic for the traditional cultural landscapes that are rapidly vanishing. This growing concern is also expressed in the European Landscape Convention, which will be used as a start for the analysis in this article. Three periods of landscape dynamics are considered: the traditional landscapes before the important changes that started in the 18th century, the landscapes of the revolutions age of the 19th to 20th century, and the post-modern new landscapes. The combined effect of the driving forces such as accessibility, urbanization, globalization and the impact of calamities have been different in each of the periods and affected the nature and pace of the changes as well as the perception people have had about the landscape. Values change accordingly and so does the way of using and shaping the landscape. It is argued that this changing perception also influences what kind and aspects of landscapes are studied, protected and managed. Diversity and identity of cultural landscapes are central in the discussion. It is shown that coherence between small composing elements in a broader spatial context is important for the legibility of the landscape and that the ability to tell the (his)story of a place strongly enhances the identity and the overall value. This offers criteria for inventorying and assessing landscapes, which is needed to define future management and development. Although the general trends of future development of the European landscapes are rather well known, planning and managing future landscape remains difficult and extremely uncertain. The processes and management in past traditional landscapes and the manifold relations people have towards the perceivable environment and the symbolic meaning it generates, offer valuable knowledge for more sustainable planning and management for future landscapes. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In both the Paleoproterozoic [2500 to 1600 million years ago (Ma)] and Neoproterozoic (1000 to 542 Ma), extended intervals of anomalously high carbon isotope ratios ($\delta$(13)C) indicate high rates of organic matter burial and release of oxygen to the atmosphere; in the Neoproterozoic, the high $\delta$(13)C interval was punctuated by abrupt swings to low $\delta$(13)C, indicating massive oxidation of organic matter. We report a Paleoproterozoic negative $\delta$(13)C excursion that is similar in magnitude and apparent duration to the Neoproterozoic anomaly. This Shunga-Francevillian anomaly may reflect intense oxidative weathering of rocks as the result of the initial establishment of an oxygen-rich atmosphere.},

abstract = {In this article, we review the nature, occurrence and environmental relevance of the authigenic ferrous iron phosphate mineral vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2{\textperiodcentered}8H2O) in waterlogged soils and aquatic sediments. We critically discuss existing work from freshwater and marine systems, laboratory studies and microbial batch culture experiments aiming to deduce common characteristics of the mineral's occurrence, and the processes governing its formation. Vivianite regularly occurs in close association with organic remains in iron-rich sediments. Simultaneously, it is a biogenic mineral product of metal reducing bacteria. These findings suggest that vivianite nucleation in natural systems is directed by the activity of such bacteria and crystal growth is particularly favoured within protected microzones. Taking into account recent findings from coastal marine sediments where vivianite authigenesis has been shown to be coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane, small-scale microbially mediated reactions appear to be crucial for the formation of vivianite. Small-scale heterogeneity within the sediment matrix may also explain why saturation calculations based upon bulk pore water constitutions often fail to accurately predict the occurrence of the mineral. Vivianite is not restricted to a specific trophic state of a system. The mineral forms in oligotrophic- as well as in eutrophic waters. However, depending on the iron inventory, the production, supply and degradation of organic matter determine the relative contribution of iron sulphide formation to the iron pool, and the concentration of inorganic phosphate and Fe2+in pore waters. Thus, vivianite authigenesis is also governed by bulk chemical conditions such as the rate of sulphide formation relative to that of Fe2+production. This situation allows stimulation of vivianite formation by iron supplementation aimed at restoring eutrophic lakes. Recent results from coastal marine sediments suggest that vivianite authigenesis is of significance for P burial in the marine realm. Vivianite authigenesis is likely important at the global scale, but has so far largely been ignored.},

abstract = {Dramatic global climate change in the Early Cretaceous suggests that numerous boreal cool events perturbed otherwise warm conditions. Abundant glendonites in Valanginian and Aptian strata are thought to be key markers of cold conditions; however, their use as climate indicators has been questioned. Therefore, a detailed study of glendonites in the context of host-rock geochemistry was conducted on Cretaceous strata exposed on Ellef Ringnes Island, Sverdrup Basin, Canadian High Arctic, to elucidate paleoenvironment controls on periodic glendonite occurrence throughout the Early Cretaceous. Two prominent glendonite zones were identified in Valanginian and Aptian strata. Data for carbon stable isotopes show $\delta$13Ccarb values of -29.5‰ to -10.5‰, consistent with a carbon source from organic matter within the surrounding shale. Trace metal data suggest deposition occurred under an overall oxidizing water column in a setting with higher than average phosphorus and highly degraded organic matter. There is no variation in the geochemical parameters of the mudstones with or without glendonites. Glendonite-bearing zones are coincident, however, with regional evidence for brief periods of colder climate conditions within the otherwise warm Early Cretaceous. We conclude that while the overall conditions for glendonite formation were prevalent throughout the Cretaceous, it was the brief cold periods that provided the final range of stability for their preservation in discrete zones of Valanginian and Aptian strata. These results support the model of an overall warm Early Cretaceous climate being punctuate by several "cold snaps" of as-yet uncertain origin. {\textcopyright} 2017 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Dissolved and suspended loads of the main streams on the island of R{\'{e}}union have been analysed for their major and trace element contents in order to characterise both chemical and mechanical erosion products. The chemical composition of R{\'{e}}union surface waters is controlled by partial dissolution of the basaltic rocks they interact with, by atmospheric input and, in some cases, by thermal spring inflow. The elemental contributions arising from these three processes have been calculated using typical concentration ratios for each endmember. The contribution from oceanic type rains is important for Cl and Na and minor for Mg, Ca, K, and Sr. Some thermal springs join their nearest rivers in Piton des Neiges calderas and influence the sulphate, Li, and B concentrations, and to a lesser extent Ca, Sr, and Rb. For all the rivers that are not affected by the thermal springs, the contribution from basalt weathering is higher than 70{\%} of the total dissolved solids. The chemical composition of the suspended load in R{\'{e}}union rivers reflects a low weathering state for basalt in each drainage basin, implying that mechanical erosion is more important than chemical erosion. Assuming a steady-state between these two complementary erosion processes, we propose a mass budget between the dissolved and suspended erosion products and the local unweathered basalt for each of the main river catchments. Given the lack of reliable long-term measurements of river suspended load at R{\'{e}}union, this mass budget enables us to calculate the suspended load concentration that is required to counterbalance the concentration of total dissolved solids due to chemical weathering. The calculated suspended load concentration is much higher than that measured which implies that equilibrium between mechanical and chemical erosion was not attained at the time of sampling. However, we suggest that in such a tropical climate, most of the suspended load will be carried during cyclonic events, these short periods of time providing about 50{\%} of the annual amount of river water. Thus, erosional steady-state must be achieved on the scale of the annual hydrologic cycle. From the total dissolved solid concentrations induced by basalt weathering, and given the annual discharge from R{\'{e}}union rivers, we infer specific chemical erosion rates of 63-170 t/km2/yr and specific atmospheric CO2 consumption rates, during basalt erosion, of 1.3-4.4 × 106 mol/km2/yr. Mechanical erosion rates deduced from the calculated suspended load concentrations range from 1200 to 9100 t/km2/yr. Total erosion (chemical plus mechanical) give basalt denudation rates of 470-3430 mm/kyr. All these erosion rates (chemical, mechanical, total, and atmospheric CO2 consumption) are among the highest global estimates and are due to high runoff, steep slopes, active volcanics, and related active tectonics, and young basaltic lithologies, which characterise R{\'{e}}union.

abstract = {Surface seawaters are supersaturated with respect to calcite, but high concentrations of magnesium prevent spontaneous nucleation and growth of crystals. Foraminifera are the most widespread group of calcifying organisms and generally produce calcite with a low Mg content, indicating that they actively remove Mg(2+) from vacuolized seawater before calcite precipitation. However, one order of foraminifera has evolved a calcification pathway, by which it produces calcite with a very high Mg content, suggesting that these species do not alter the Mg/Ca ratio of vacuolized seawater considerably. The cellular mechanism that makes it possible to precipitate calcite at high Mg concentrations, however, has remained unknown. Here we demonstrate that they are able to elevate the pH at the site of calcification by at least one unit above seawater pH and, thereby, overcome precipitation-inhibition at ambient Mg concentrations. A similar result was obtained for species that precipitate calcite with a low Mg concentration, suggesting that elevating the pH at the site of calcification is a widespread strategy among foraminifera to promote calcite precipitation. Since the common ancestor of these two groups dates back to the Cambrian, our results would imply that this physiological mechanism has evolved over half a billion years ago. Since foraminifera rely on elevating the intracellular pH for their calcification, our results show that ongoing ocean acidification can result in a decrease of calcite production by these abundant calcifyers.},

@article{Erba2004a,
abstract = {Twenty-five years ago, Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) were documented and formalised as intervals of widespread to global deposition of organic matter. The Toarcian, Early Aptian (OAE1a) and latest Cenomanian (OAE2) OAEs are truly global in nature, commonly carbonate-poor, and typically represented by organic carbon-rich black shales. In some areas, these OAEs are also characterised by abundant radiolarian-sands and silts. They are associated with negative and positive excursions in the87Sr/86Sr record, in addition to large global carbon-isotope anomalies in carbonate and/or organic matter, caused by a major perturbation of the global carbon budget. Increased rates of volcanism during the formation of the Ontong Java (and Manihiki) and Caribbean Plates, and the Karoo-Ferrar Traps, are believed to have caused the geological responses associated with OAE1a, OAE2, and the Toarcian OAE, respectively. Excess volcanogenic CO2in the atmosphere most probably turned the climate into a greenhouse mode, accelerating continental weathering and increasing nutrient content in oceanic surface-waters via river run-off. Higher fertility in the global ocean was also probably triggered directly by submarine igneous events that introduced enormous quantities of biolimiting metals within hydrothermal plumes. Because Mesozoic OAEs are often represented by carbonate-poor sediments, quantitative studies of calcareous nannofossils have been applied to explore (a) the causes and effects of igneous/tectonic events and climate changes, relative to nannofloral increases and crises, as well as (b) dissolution events, and (c) diagenetic modifications. Characterization of calcareous nannofloras in OAE intervals can improve our understanding of the marine ecosystem and biological processes such as photosynthesis (biological pump) and biomineralisation (carbonate pump) that affect the organic and inorganic carbon cycle, as well as adsorption of atmospheric CO2in the oceans. Types and rates of nannoplankton production and evolution are interpreted to trace the impact of major palaeoceanographic and palaeoclimatic events. In selected sections, it has been documented that calcareous nannofloras rapidly reacted to new conditions of fertility and higher pCO2by drastically reducing calcification. As in the modern oceans, during OAEs the increase of nutrients and atmospheric CO2induced higher abundances of nannoplankton producing small placoliths and inhibited the deep-photic zone nannoconids and schizosphaerellids. Similarly to the 'nannoconid crisis' preceding deposition of the Early Aptian OAE1a black shales, a 'schizosphaerellid crisis' is detected prior to the Toarcian OAE. Both OAEs are further characterised by a rapid nannofloral speciation, beginning approximately 1.5 myr before the OAE, but without extinctions. Global changes during the latest Cenomanian OAE 2 exerted different influences on calcareous nannoplankton that experienced a turnover due to most extreme environmental conditions. This event, in fact, was a time of extinctions followed by originations within calcareous nannofossils. Precise timing of the events before, during and after OAE1a, OAE2 and the Toarcian OAE indicates that they were intervals of enhanced oceanic productivity and that anoxia/dysoxia post-dated biotic changes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Brilon-reef complex is one of the biggest Devonian carbonate buildups ({\~{}}80 km2) of the Rheinisches Schiefergebirge. The Burgberg section is located in the southeastern fore-reef area of the Brilon Reef Complex and exposes a succession of strata (117 m thick), which extends from the Middle Givetian (middle varcus conodont Zone) to the Vis{\'{e}}an (bilineatus conodont Zone). Field and microfacies observations led to the definition of nine microfacies that are integrated into a sedimentary model divided into off-reef, intermediate fore-reef, and proximal fore-reef sedimentary domains (SD). The off-reef domain (SD1) is the most distal setting observed and is characterized by fine-grained sediments, dominated by pelagic biota and the local occurrence of gravity-flow deposits. The intermediate fore-reef (SD2) is characterized by a mixture of biota and sediments coming from both deeper-water and shallow-water sources and is influenced by storm and gravity-flow currents. In this domain, Renalcis mound-like structures developed locally. Finally, the proximal fore-reef (SD3) corresponds to the most proximal setting that is strongly influenced by gravity-flow currents derived from the Brilon Reef Complex. The temporal evolution of microfacies in the fore-reef setting of the Burgberg section show five main paleoenvironmental trends influenced by the onset, general development, and demise/drowning of the Brilon Reef Complex. Fore-reef to off-reef lithologies and their temporal changes are from the base to the top of the section: (U1)-fine-grained sediments with large reef debris, corresponding to the initial development of the reef building upon submarine volcaniclastic deposits during the Middle Givetian (middle varcus Zone) and first export of reef debris in the fore-reef setting; (U2)-high increase of reef-derived material in the fore-reef area, corresponding to a significant progradation of the reef from the Middle Givetian to the Early Frasnian (maximum extension of the Brilon Reef Complex to the south, disparilis to the falsiovalis conodont biozones); (U3)-progressive decrease of shallow-water derived material and increase of fine-grained sediments and deep-water biota into the fore-reef setting, corresponding to the stepwise withdrawal of the reef influence; from the Middle to the Late Frasnian (jamieae conodont Zone); (U4)-development of a submarine rise characterized by nodular and cephalopod-bearing limestones extending from the Late Frasnian to the Late Famennian corresponding to the demise and drowning of the Brilon Reef Complex as a result of the Late Frasnian Kellwasser events (upper rhenana and triangularis conodont biozones); (U5)-significant deepening of the Burgberg area starting in the Late Famennian, directly followed by an aggrading trend marked by pelagic shales overlying the nodular limestone deposits. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Carbonate rocks from the Middle Ediacaran period in locations all over the globe record the largest excursion in carbon isotopic compositions in Earth history. This finding suggests a dramatic reorganization of Earth's carbon cycle. Named the Shuram excursion for its original discovery in the Shuram Formation, Oman, the anomaly closely precedes impressive events in evolution, including the rise of large metazoans and the origin of biomineralization in animals. Instead of a true record of the carbon cycle at the time of sedimentation, the carbon isotope signature recorded in the Shuram excursion could be caused by alteration following deposition of the carbonate sediments, a scenario supported by several geochemical indicators. However, such secondary processes are intrinsically local, which makes it difficult to explain the coincident occurrence of carbon isotope anomalies in numerous records around the globe. Both possibilities are intriguing: if the Shuram excursion preserves a genuine record of ancient seawater chemistry, it reflects a perturbation to the carbon cycle that is stronger than any known perturbations of the modern Earth. If, however, it represents secondary alteration during burial of sediments, then marine sediments must have been globally preconditioned in a unique way, to allow ordinary and local processes to produce an extraordinary and widespread response.},

abstract = {The results of a simulation of the Late Cretaceous climate using the GENESIS Climate System Model suggest that the Earth had overall higher temperatures, with the equatorial region approaching 34 °C. This has broad implications for how the climate system operated. There was a much higher vapor content in the atmosphere, and a much greater role for latent heat transport in achieving the global energy balance. The classic Late Cretaceous climate paradox, that the lesser meridional temperature gradient implies slower winds and ocean currents and less poleward energy transport, while also implying greater poleward energy transport to account for the reduced temperature gradient, is explained by the increased water vapor content of the air. The replacement of air molecules by vapor molecules creates atmospheric pressure differences that make up for the loss of pressure difference due to reduced thermal gradients. As a result, wind and ocean current speeds were about the same as today. The increased rates of evaporation and precipitation caused greater regional salinity contrasts in the ocean, so that salinity became a major factor in controlling ocean circulation. Although the overall structure of the ocean was probably the same as today, the ocean interior differed in important details. The layer of cool, low salinity intermediate water that characterizes much of the ocean today was probably replaced by warmer, saline water from the Tethys and the young Atlantic.},

The Discussion Meeting, entitled 'Warm climates of the past: a lesson for the future?', brought together 16 eminent international speakers from the field of palaeoclimate, and was attended by over 280 scientists and members of the public. Many of the speakers have contributed to the papers compiled in this Discussion Meeting Issue. The papers summarize the talks at the meeting, and present further or related work. This Discussion Meeting Issue asks to what extent information gleaned from the study of past climates can aid our understanding of future climate change. Climate change is currently an issue at the forefront of environmental science, and also has important sociological and political implications. Most future predictions are carried out by complex numerical models; however, these models cannot be rigorously tested for scenarios outside of the modern, without making use of past climate data. Furthermore, past climate data can inform our understanding of how the Earth system operates, and can provide important contextual information related to environmental change. All past time periods can be useful in this context; here, we focus on past climates that were warmer than the modern climate, as these are likely to be the most similar to the future. This introductory paper is not meant as a comprehensive overview of all work in this field. Instead, it gives an introduction to the important issues therein, using the papers in this Discussion Meeting Issue, and other works from all the Discussion Meeting speakers, as exemplars of the various ways in which past climates can inform projections of future climate. Furthermore, we present new work that uses a palaeo constraint to quantitatively inform projections of future equilibrium ice sheet change.},

abstract = {We review available data constraining the extent, volume, age and duration of all major Phanerozoic continental flood basalts (CFB or traps) and oceanic plateaus (OP), together forming the group of large igneous provinces (LIP), going from the smallest Columbia flood basalts at ???16 Ma to the as yet ill-known remnants of a possible trap at ???360 Ma in eastern Siberia. The 16 traps (CFB and OP) reviewed form a rather unimodal distribution with an initial modal volume of the order of 2.5 Mkm3. Most provinces agree with a rather simple first order model in which volcanism may have lasted of the order of 10 Ma, often resulting in continental break-up, but where most of the volume was erupted in about 1 Ma or sometimes less. This makes CFBs/OPs (LIPs) major geodynamic events, with fluxes exceeding the total output of present day hot spots and even possibly exceeding over short times the entire crustal production of mid-ocean ridges. The proposed correlation between trap ages and the ages of several geological events, including mass extinctions and oceanic anoxia, is found to have improved steadily as more data have become available, to the point that the list of trap ages may coincide with many major divisions in the geological time scale. The four largest mass extinctions in the last 260 Ma coincide to the best resolution available with four traps, making a causal connection between the two through some form of catastrophic climatic perturbations the most likely hypothesis. The time sequence of LIPs appears to have been random and there is no robust evidence for long time trends in the corresponding crustal production rate over the last 260 Ma. ?? 2003 Acad??mie des sciences/??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.

abstract = {We use multiple stable isotope measurements in two highly stratified estuaries located along the Mediterranean coast of Israel (the Yarqon and the Qishon) to explore the consumption of sulfate through the anaerobic oxidation of methane (sulfate-driven AOM). At both sites, pore fluid sulfate is rapidly consumed within the upper 15-20cm. Although the pore fluid sulfate and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration profiles change over a similar range with respect to depth, the sulfur and oxygen isotopes in the pore fluid sulfate and the carbon isotopes in the pore fluid DIC are fundamentally different. This pore fluid isotope geochemistry indicates that the microbial mechanism of sulfate reduction differs between the studied sites. We suggest that in the Yarqon estuary, sulfate is consumed entirely through AOM, whereas in the Qishon, both AOM and bacterial sulfate reduction through organic matter oxidation coexist. These results have implications for understanding the microbial mechanisms behind sulfate-driven AOM. Our data compilation from marine and marginal marine environments supports the conclusion that the intracellular pathways of sulfate reduction varies among environments with sulfate-driven AOM. The data can be used to elucidate new pathways in the cycling of methane and sulfate, and the findings are applicable to the broader marine environment. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Sulfur isotope studies of post-Archean terrestrial materials have focused on the ratio 34S/32S because additional isotopes, 33S and 36S, were thought to carry little information beyond the well-known mass-dependent relationship among multiple-isotope ratios. We report high-precision analyses of ??33S and ??36S values, defined as deviations of 33S and 36S from ideal mass-dependent relationships, for international reference materials and sedimentary sulfides of Phanerozoic age by using a fluorination technique with a dual-inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Measured variations in ??33S and ??36S are explained as resulting from processes involve branching reactions (two or more reservoirs formed) or mixing. Irreversible processes in closed systems (Rayleigh distillation) amplify the isotope effect. We outline how this new isotope proxy can be used to gain new insights into fundamental aspects of the sulfur biogeochemical cycle, including additional constraints on seawater sulfate budget and processes in sedimentary sulfide formation. The isotope systematics discussed here cannot explain the much larger variation of ??33S and ??36S observed in Archean rock records. Furthermore, Phanerozoic samples we have studied show a characteristic ??33S and ??36S relationship that differs from those measured in Archean rocks and laboratory photolysis experiments. Thus, high precision analysis of ??33S and ??36S can be used to distinguish small non-zero ??33S and ??36S produced by mass-dependent processes from those produced by mass-independent processes in Archean rocks and extraterrestrial materials. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

High-amplitude sea-level changes and positive delta18O excursions in marine limestones suggest that glaciation events may have punctuated this episode of extreme warmth. New delta18O data from the tropical Atlantic show synchronous shifts approximately 91.2 million years ago for both the surface and deep ocean that are consistent with an approximately 200,000-year period of glaciation, with ice sheets of about half the size of the modern Antarctic ice cap. Even the prevailing supergreenhouse climate was not a barrier to the formation of large ice sheets, calling into question the common assumption that the poles were always ice-free during past periods of intense global warming.},

This is better described as an impure carbonate-containing apatite (CO3Ap) and forms the inorganic component of bones and teeth. Table 1⇓ also includes calcium phosphates (including two pyrophosphates) that occur in pathological mineralizations and those that are used for the repair of mineralized tissues. Unlike the well-controlled process of normal mineralization in bones and teeth (see later), pathological mineralizations are usually poorly controlled with the result that several calcium phosphates may occur together. In addition, their crystallographic orientations are often random.View this table:In this windowIn a new windowTable 1. Occurrence of calcium phosphates. The solubility isotherms of the calcium phosphates in the system Ca(OH)2-H3PO4-H2O at 37°C are shown in Figure 1⇓. Monetite occurs in the phase diagram, although its occurrence in normal or pathological calcifications has never been confirmed, one contributing reason being that its nucleation and growth is more difficult than brushite under biological conditions, so brushite forms in preference, even though brushite is less stable. $\beta$-Ca3(PO4)2 is a high-temperature phase that does not precipitate directly in aqueous systems; however, it is sufficiently stable in water for a solubility product to be determined so that an isotherm can be calculated, which is the origin of the isotherm in Figure 1⇓. However, if the aqueous system contains Mg2+ (1 or 2 mmol/l), the solubility product of “Ca3(PO4)2” is dramatically reduced (more than a thousand-fold) with the result that the structurally related whitlockite can easily precipitate (Hamad and Heughebaert 1986, LeGeros et al. 1989).

@article{Prevedi2011,
abstract = {Climate sensitivity in its most basic form is defined as the equilibrium change in global surface temperature that occurs in response to a climate forcing, or externally imposed perturbation of the planetary energy balance.Within this general definition, several specific forms of climate sensitivity exist that differ in terms of the types of climate feedbacks they include. Based on evidence from Earth's history, we suggest here that the relevant form of climate sensitivity in the Anthropocene (e.g. from which to base future greenhouse gas (GHG) stabilization targets) is the Earth system sensitivity including fast feedbacks from changes in water vapour, natural aerosols, clouds and sea ice, slower surface albedo feedbacks from changes in continental ice sheets and vegetation, and climate–GHG feedbacks from changes in natural (land and ocean) carbon sinks. Traditionally, only fast feedbacks have been considered (with the other feedbacks either ignored or treated as forcing), which has led to estimates of the climate sensitivity for doubled CO2 concentrations of about 3◦C. The 2×CO2 Earth system sensitivity is higher than this, being ∼4–6◦C if the ice sheet/vegetation albedo feedback is included in addition to the fast feedbacks, and higher still if climate–GHG feedbacks are also included. The inclusion of climate–GHG feedbacks due to changes in the natural carbon sinks has the advantage of more directly linking anthropogenic GHG emissions with the ensuing global temperature increase, thus providing a truer indication of the climate sensitivity to human perturbations. The Earth system climate sensitivity is difficult to quantify due to the lack of palaeo-analogues for the present-day anthropogenic forcing, and the fact that ice sheet and climate–GHG feedbacks have yet to become globally significant in the Anthropocene. Furthermore, current models are unable to adequately simulate the physics of ice sheet decay and certain aspects of the natural carbon and nitrogen cycles. Obtaining quantitative estimates of the Earth system sensitivity is therefore a high priority for future work},

abstract = {High amplitude positive carbon isotope excursions in the Late Devonian, the punctata and Kellwasser events, reflect major perturbations in the global carbon cycle that have been attributed to increased continental weathering and subsequent ocean eutrophication. Despite the comparable carbon isotope anomalies, however, a major extinction has been reported only for the Kellwasser Events, while the punctata Event is marked by low extinction intensity. This study presents multiple sulfur isotope records of carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) and pyrite from Late Devonian sections in the Great Basin, USA, in order to document changes in the coupled (or decoupled) geochemical cycles of carbon and sulfur during the punctata and Upper Kellwasser events. A positive sulfur isotope shift in both CAS and pyrite accompanies the onset of the punctata Event, but to a larger extent in the latter. As a result, the sulfur isotope offset between CAS and pyrite (??34SCAS-py) dropped to less than 10???. In the middle of the punctata Event, a sharp negative ??34SCAS excursion and negative ??34SCAS-py values coincide with the Alamo impact. Unlike the rapid ??34Spy and ??34SCAS oscillations associated with the punctata Event, the Upper Kellwasser was a period of relative stability, except for a brief ??34SCAS drop before the event. Paired sulfur isotope data, aided by a simple box model, suggest that the geochemical cycle of sulfur may have been partly responsible for the contrasting biological responses that define these events. High stratigraphic ??34Spy and ??34SCAS variability, coupled with strong reservoir effect, demonstrates a relatively small oceanic sulfate pool existed during the punctata Event. Further, the Alamo impact likely triggered the rapid oxidation of microbially-produced sulfide within this event. The expansion of sulfidic bottom water thus may have been impeded during the punctata Event. In contrast, the lack of a positive shift in ??34SCAS and sizable ??34SCAS-py values ({\textgreater}15???) throughout the Upper Kellwasser Event imply higher relative sulfate levels. A larger seawater sulfate reservoir may have promoted the development of sulfidic bottom waters in the eutrophic epicontinental seas, increasing biological stress and potentially contributing to the mass extinction.},

@article{Hallam1981,
abstract = {One of the most important episodes of mass extinction of animal groups in the whole of the Phanerozoic took place in the latter part of the Triassic, but the time of major faunal turnover of the vertebrates preceded that of marine invertebrates by several million years. As shown by ammonites, brachiopods and conodonts, decline from a Carnian-early Norian diversity peak was followed by a significant extinction episode at the end of the period. This pattern is confirmed at generic and subgeneric level by the bivalve molluscs, probably the most abundant and diverse macroinvertebrate group. This paper analyses the bivalves in detail and attempts to seek a relationship of the extinction event to environmental changes as recorded by late Triassic facies. Stratigraphy of the youngest Triassic is briefly discussed. Following a recent recommendation, the Rhaetian stage is dropped and the Upper Norian (Sevatian) subdivided into three new ammonite zones. It is suggested that the classic northwest European "Rhaetic" correlates with the K{\"{o}}ssen and Zlambach Beds of the Alps and corresponds at least approximately with the upper two of these zones. It is estimated that nearly half the existing bivalve genera and nearly all the species failed to survive the end-Triassic extinction event. The trigonioid, unionoid and hippuritoid orders were especially strongly affected but most of the pholadomyoid genera survived. Three major ecological categories are distinguished: a shallow neritic group, to which most taxa belong, a euryhaline group that could tolerate marginal marine and lagoonal conditions, and a deep neritic group, notably Halobia and Monotis. All groups were strongly affected by the extinction but species of the deep neritic group were apparently the most susceptible. Seven biogeographic regions are distinguished for the purpose of analysis and it is shown that provinciality is slight, but some important taxa are endemic to the Tethyan and Pacific regions. Endemic genera prove to have been much more subject to extinction than cosmopolitans. There are very few places in the world with a more or less continuous marine sequence of deposits across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Details are given of sections in the Alps, northwest Europe and Nevada and briefer mention made of others. With regard to late Triassic palaeogeographic changes, those involving climate were neglibible, but there was a more or less progressive regression of epicontinental seas following a Ladinian-early Carnian transgressive maximum, with a corresponding shallowing in the more continuously marine Tethyan region. That this first-order effect was due to a eustatic lowering of sea level is fairly certain, but the situation is less clear for second-order transgressive-regressive cycles. The late late Norian ("Rhaetian") cycle is probably, however, the results of a minor eustatic event. By the end of the Triassic the sea had regressed substantially and the mass extinction event is though to be bound up partly with this phenomenon and partly with the phase of widespread anoxicity that occurred during the succeeding Hettangian transgression. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {The biggest mass extinction of the past 600 million years (My), the end-Permian event (251My ago), witnessed the loss of as much as 95{\%} of all species on Earth. Key questions for biologists concern what combination of environmental changes could possibly have had such a devastating effect, the scale and pattern of species loss, and the nature of the recovery. New studies on dating the event, contemporary volcanic activity, and the anatomy of the environmental crisis have changed our perspectives dramatically in the past five years. Evidence on causation is equivocal, with support for either an asteroid impact or mass volcanism, but the latter seems most probable. The extinction model involves global warming by 6°C and huge input of light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system from the eruptions, but especially from gas hydrates, leading to an ever-worsening positive-feedback loop, the ‘runaway greenhouse'.},

abstract = {Many biogeochemical anomalies coincide with the Late Permian Extinction (LPE; 252.28Ma). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the moretane/hopane anomaly that has been identified in samples from Meishan GSSP section in southeastern China. Here, we report homohopane, 2$\alpha$- and 3$\beta$-methylhomohopane and lithological data for a drill core from the Meishan section in southeastern China. Three intervals of elevated C 30 moretane/hopane ratios are recorded in the Lungtan, Yinkeng and Helongshan Formations. Moretane/hopane ratios of C 31-34 homohopanes and the 2$\alpha$- and 3$\beta$-methylhomohopanes display the same stratigraphic patterns as the C 30 moretane/hopane record. In light of the multiple and parallel moretane anomalies for the homohopane and 2$\alpha$- and 3$\beta$-methylhomohopane series, enhanced input from higher plant organic matter, such as coal and peat, does not adequately explain the observed isomer patterns. Correlation of high moretane/hopane ratios with low C 35 Homohopane Index (HHI) and high hopane/sterane values suggest increased input of hopanoids from oxic soils. Additionally, moretane/hopane ratios show excellent correlations with total clay percentages and specific clay types, particularly chlorite, illite, and mixed layer illite/smectite. We conclude that a combination of episodic hopanoid input from soil bacteria and diagenetic effects related to redox and detrital clays generated the unique moretane/hopane patterns at Meishan.Similar relationships of Ts/(Ts. +. Tm) with redox, source indicators, and lithology indicate that Ts/(Ts. +. Tm) is affected by the same factors controlling the moretane/hopane ratios. Berthierine, a clay that requires reducing conditions for formation, was detected in samples from the Lungtan Formation. We are unable to determine from our results whether the berthierine is authigenic or detrital, but future determination of the origin of berthierine at Meishan may offer additional environmental insight. No link between diasteranes and lithology was observed in this study suggesting that diasteranes are relatively unaffected by the detrital clay component of the Meishan sediments. In total, the results point toward the complex role of source input, lithology, and depositional redox conditions in the transformation of organic matter during maturation. Future work is required to elucidate the lithological effects on diagenetic processes, including biomarker genesis isomerization, and thermal degradation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Leg 165 of the Ocean Drilling Program afforded a unique opportunity to investigate organic and inorganic geochemistry across a wide gradient of sediment compositions and corresponding chemical pathways. The solid fractions at Site 998, 999, 1000, and 1001 reveal varying proportions of reactive carbonate species, a labile volcanic ash fraction occurring in discrete layers and as a dispersed component, and detrital fluxes that derive from continental weathering. The relative proportions and reactivities of these end-members strongly dictate the character of the diagenetic profiles observed during the pore-water work of Leg 165. In addition, alteration of the well-characterized basaltic basement at Site 1001 has provided a strong signal that is reflected in many of the dissolved components. The relative effects of basement alteration and diagenesis within the sediment column are discussed in terms of downcore relationships for dissolved calcium and magnesium. With the exception of Site 1002 in the Cariaco Basin, the sediments encountered during Leg 165 were uniformly deficient in organic carbon (typically {\textless}0.1 wt{\%}). Consequently, rates of organic oxidation were generally low and dominated by suboxic pathways with subordinate levels of bacterial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis. The low rates of organic remineralization are supported by modeled rates of sulfate reduction. Site 1000 provided an exception to the generally low levels of microbially mediated redox cycling. At this site the sediment is slightly more enriched in organic phases, and externally derived thermogenic hydrocarbons appear to aid in driving enhanced levels of redox diagenesis at great depths below the seafloor. The entrapment of these volatiles corresponds with a permeability seal defined by a pronounced Miocene minimum in calcium carbonate concentration recognized throughout the basin and with a dramatic downcore increase in the magnitude of limestone lithification. The latter has been tentatively linked to increases in alkalinity associated with microbial oxidation of organic matter and gaseous hydrocarbons. Recognition and quantification of previously unconstrained large volumes and frequencies of Eocene and Miocene silicic volcanic ash within the Caribbean Basin is one of the major findings of Leg 165. High frequencies of volcanic ash layers manifest as varied but often dominant controls on pore-water chemistry. Sulfur isotope results are presented that speak to secondary metal and sulfur enrichments observed in ash layers sampled during Leg 165. Ultimately, a better mechanistic understanding of these processes and the extent to which they have varied spatially and temporally may bear on the global mass balances for a range of major and minor dissolved components of seawater.},

abstract = {Current chemostratigraphical studies of the Jurassic System primarily involve the use of one sedimentary component (marine organic carbon), one divalent transition metal substituted in carbonate (manganese), and two isotopic tracers: strontium-isotope ratios (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) and carbon-isotope ratios ({\"{a}} 13 C carb and {\"{a}} 13 C org) in carbonate and in organic matter. Other parameters such as Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios in calcite, oxygen-isotope ratios ({\"{a}} 18 O) in carbonate, sulphur-isotope ratios ({\"{a}} 34 S) in carbonate-hosted sulphate, nitrogen-isotope ratios ({\"{a}} 15 N org) in organic matter, osmium-isotope ratios (187 Os/ 188 Os) in black shales and neodymium-isotope ratios (143 Nd/ 144 Nd) in various mineral phases are also useful but at present give poor resolution because the database is incomplete or compromised by various factors. Stratigraphical patterns in total organic carbon (TOC) can be of either local or regional significance, depending on the lateral extent of the former nutrient-rich and productive water mass. Divalent manganese follows a similar pattern, being concentrated, most probably as a very early diagenetic phase, only in oxygen-depleted waters that typically underlie zones of elevated organic productivity. Shifts in Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios on the time scale of ammonite subzones seem largely to reflect temperature changes. Strontium-isotope ratios from pristine skeletal calcite provide a global signal; {\"{a}} 13 C values from carbonates with minimal diagenetic overprint potentially do the same, although small spatial differences in palaeo-water-mass composition may have been locally significant. Oxygen-isotope determinations on carbonate rocks and fossils generally yield values that are too scattered to be stratigraphically useful, because they reflect palaeotemperature, the evaporation–precipitation balance in sea water and the impact of any diagenesis involving an aqueous phase. Nitrogen-isotope ratios in organic matter reflect the chemistry of ancient water masses as affected by nitrate utilization and denitrification, and the stratigraphical pattern of this parameter is more likely to correlate only on a regional basis. Neodymium-isotope ratios in sea water are also water mass dependent and greatly affected by regional sources and oceanic current systems. Preliminary data on sulphur-isotope ratios in carbonates and osmium-isotope ratios in organic-rich shales, both potentially offering global correlation, indicate that these tracers may be valuable, although the records at present are not sufficiently well established to allow high-resolution regional correlation. In all cases, biostratigraphically well-dated reference sections, against which the relevant geochemical data have been calibrated, are required in the first instance. To date, studies on the stratigraphical distribution of organic carbon have been principally carried out in both northern (Boreal) and southern (Tethyan) Europe; carbon-isotope stratigraphy has been undertaken primarily, but not exclusively, on bulk pelagic sediments from the Alpine–Mediterranean or Tethyan domain; and strontium-isotope stratigraphy has been undertaken largely on calcitic skeletal material (belemnites and oysters) from northern and southern Europe. In many sections, including those containing ammonites, multi-parameter chemostratigraphy can give resolution that exceeds that attainable by classic biostratigraphical means. Strontium-isotope ratios in skeletal calcite are a particularly powerful tool for illustrating changes in sedimentary rate and revealing gaps in the stratigraphical record.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Examination of Lower Triassic carbonate rocks from around the world has revealed the resurgence of atypical carbonates that were last common during the Proterozoic ('anachronistic facies'). Anachronistic facies are attributed to a combination of post-extinction paleoecologic factors and widespread, harsh environmental conditions, particularly the presence of anoxic, alkaline waters in the global ocean. The marine rocks of the Moenkopi Formation (Virgin Limestone) of southern Nevada and laterally equivalent deep-water limestones of the Union Wash Formation of east-central California provide a means to reconstruct depositional environments across a Lower Triassic carbonate ramp and place the atypical facies and fabrics that occur within those rocks into a larger 'Anachronistic Platform Model.' Examination of shallow subtidal and intertidal facies reveal widespread ooid shoals in both the Union Wash Formation and Virgin Limestone, as well as the presence of small, fringing stromatolite bioherms in shallow subtidal environments of the Union Wash Formation. Inner to middle ramp environments of the Virgin Limestone contain aggregates of cabbage-head stromatolites that formed 1-2 m-high patch-reef bioherms, in addition to flat-pebble conglomerates, mud-chip facies and wrinkle structures. Deep-water facies from the Union Wash Formation contain synsedimentary calcium carbonate precipitates that form laterally extensive crusts in basinal environments, or interlocking mosaics of hemispheres and fans in outer ramp to slope environments. The results of this study reveal that carbonate sedimentation during the Early Triassic was controlled by a combination of biotic factors, environmental stresses, unusual oceanic chemistry and normal carbonate sedimentary processes that resulted in the development of carbonate platforms that had affinities to both Phanerozoic and Proterozoic depositional systems.},

abstract = {This paper is a synthesis of the use of selected trace elements as proxies for reconstruction of paleoproductivity and paleoredox conditions. Many of the trace elements considered here show variations in oxidation state and solubility as a function of the redox status of the depositional environment. Redox-sensitive trace metals tend to be more soluble under oxidizing conditions and less soluble under reducing conditions, resulting in authigenic enrichments in oxygen-depleted sedimentary facies. This behavior makes U, V and Mo, and to a lesser extent certain other trace metals such as Cr and Co, useful as paleoredox proxies. Some redox-sensitive elements are delivered to the sediment mainly in association with organic matter (Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd) and they may be retained within the sediment in association with pyrite, after organic matter decay in reducing sediment. This particularity confers to Ni and Cu a good value as proxies for organic C sinking flux (frequently referred to as productivity). Elements with only one oxidation state such as Ba and P are classically used to assess paleoproductivity levels but they suffer from the fact that they are solubilized under reducing conditions and may be lost from oxygen-deprived sediments. The combined used of U, V and Mo enrichments may allow suboxic environments to be distinguished from anoxic-euxinic ones. Specifically, these elements tend to be much more strongly enriched in anoxic-euxinic environments and to exhibit weaker covariation with TOC than in suboxic environments.},

abstract = {Multicellularity arose multiple times in the evolutionary history of eukaryotes, and simple multicellularity may have a deep history tracing back to the Paleoproterozoic. However, complex multicellular organisms with cellular and tissue differentiation did not appear in the fossil record until the Mesoproterozoic, and it is not until the Ediacaran Period (635–541 Ma) when diverse assemblages of complex multicellular eukaryotes evolved. In the interven- ing Tonian Period (ca. 1000–720 Ma), the fossil record of multicellular organisms is poorly documented. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated Chuaria and associated carbona- ceous compression fossils from the Tonian Liulaobei Formation in North China. These fossils have been variously interpreted as unicellular or multicellular organisms. Our analysis using backscattered-electron scanning electron microscopy (BSE-SEM) revealed direct evidence for simple multicellularity in some of these fossils and suggests that Chuaria may have had a multicellular vegetative stage in its life cycle. This study demonstrates that BSE-SEM has the potential to unveil the hidden diversity of multicellular organisms in the Tonian Period, thus enriching our knowledge about the multiple origins of multicellularity in this critical geological period before Cryogenian glaciations.},

abstract = {A subrosion pipe or sinkhole is a geologic phenomenon that occurs due to dissolution of strata in the subsurface causing the overlying sediments to collapse. The subrosion pipe in the Winterswijk quarry complex in the eastern Netherlands yielded rare, dark-colored shales. Bivalves and palynomorphs indicate that the shales were deposited during the Rhaetian (uppermost Triassic). In addition, detailed correlation with other NW European localities in Great Britain, Austria, and Germany further constrained the age of the shales to the middle of the Rhaetian. The shales were deposited in a near-coastal environment and contained a low diverse macroinvertebrate fauna with bivalves and some brittle stars that lived in a hostile environment, probably caused by low salinity and oxygen levels. These middle Rhaetian shales were mixed with dark-colored middle to late Hettangian sediments, both overlying Middle Triassic (Anisian) strata, which is present in the pipe as well. The presence of Rhaetian sediments in the subrosion pipe reopened the discussion on its age of formation. We suggest that a collapse in the Middle Eocene is most likely. This research expands the knowledge of the marine realms in the uppermost Triassic in Europe, just prior to the Permian--Triassic extinction event.},

@article{Imbrie1973,
abstract = {A simplified and more accurate version of the quantitative paleoenvironmental method proposed by Imbrie and Kipp (1971) is described, which is based on untransformed rather than transformed species per cent data. The method yields faunal indices (Ts, Tw, S), useful both as objective measures of paleontological properties and as estimates of Pleistocene sea-surface summer and winter temperatures (Ts, Tw) and salinity (S). Similarly, the oxygen-isotope method yields objective measurements of $\delta$ O18, useful stratigraphically and as indications of past changes in isotopic water composition and temperature. Laboratory errors of the two methods have about the same magnitude relative to ranges observed in V12-122. Accuracy of faunal indices as estimates of oceanic conditions is evaluated by study of modern oceanographic data and sea-bed samples. Under favorable conditions, accuracy is apparently limited primarily by the degree of ecological control exercised by the estimated parameter. Accuracy of the isotopic paleotemperature estimates is limited primarily by uncertainty as to the magnitude of the water-correction term in the isotope equation, a value which combines global ice-volume and local evaporation-precipitation effects. Curves of $\delta$ O13 and S in V12-122 record all or part of seven major climatic cycles, and display a fundamental periodicity of about 85,000 years. Ts and Tw curves show small but significant differences: two phase shifts in estimated temperature minima, and a long-term increasing trend. Amplitude-frequency histograms of Tw and $\delta$ O18 indicate that only two percent of the time during the past 450,000 years have Caribbean temperatures been as warm and isotopic ratios as low as they are today. A comparison of the magnitude of $\delta$ O18 change (2.2{\%}.) during the shift from late-glacial to post-glacial times, with that of the faunally estimated change in average temperature (2.2°C), provides a basis for estimating the associated change in isotopic water composition (1.8{\%}.) by back-calculation in the isotope equation. At least 0.4{\%}. of this change in A is attributed to an evaporation-precipitation effect, and the balance (≤1.4{\%}.) to an icevolume effect. Isotopic and faunal methods monitor different responses to global climatic change. Used in conjunction, they provide deeper insights into the past than either could achieve alone.},

abstract = {Abstract. Quaternary sea level fluctuations have greatly affected the sediment budgets of the continental shelves. Previous studies suggested that this caused a considerable increase in the net loss of shelf sediments. Since sediment accumulation and erosion are closely tied to the formation and re-oxidation of pyrite, we use a high-resolution record of sulfur isotope ratios (34S / 32S) of marine sulfate to evaluate the implications of the so-called "shelf sediment offloading" on the global sulfur cycle. Modeling of our $\delta$34S record suggests that erosion during sea level lowstands was only partly compensated by increased sedimentation during times of rising sea level and sea level highstands. Furthermore, our data suggests that shelf systems reached a new equilibrium state about 700 ka, which considerably slowed or terminated shelf sediment offloading.},

abstract = {Oxygenic photosynthesis is widely accepted as the most important bioenergetic process happening in Earth's surface environment. It is thought to have evolved within the cyanobacterial lineage, but it has been difficult to determine when it began. Evidence based on the occurrence and appearance of stromatolites and microfossils indicates that phototrophy occurred as long ago as 3,465 Myr although no definite physiological inferences can be made from these objects. Carbon isotopes and other geological phenomena provide clues but are also equivocal. Biomarkers are potentially useful because the three domains of extant life-Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya-have signature membrane lipids with recalcitrant carbon skeletons. These lipids turn into hydrocarbons in sediments and can be found wherever the record is sufficiently well preserved. Here we show that 2-methyl-bacteriohopanepolyols occur in a high proportion of cultured cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial mats. Their 2-methylhopane hydrocarbon derivatives are abundant in organic-rich sediments as old as 2,500 Myr. These biomarkers may help constrain the age of the oldest cyanobacteria and the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis. They could also be used to quantify the ecological importance of cyanobacteria through geological time.},

abstract = {The late Early Triassic sedimentary-facies evolution and carbonate carbon-isotope marine record (??13Ccarb) of ammonoid-rich, outer platform settings show striking similarities between the South China Block (SCB) and the widely distant Northern Indian Margin (NIM). The studied sections are located within the Triassic Tethys Himalayan belt (Losar section, Himachal Pradesh, India) and the Nanpanjiang Basin in the South China Block (Jinya section, Guangxi Province), respectively. Carbon isotopes from the studied sections confirm the previously observed carbon cycle perturbations at a time of major paleoceanographic changes in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis. This study documents the coincidence between a sharp increase in the carbon isotope composition and the worldwide ammonoid evolutionary turnover (extinction followed by a radiation) occurring around the Smithian-Spathian boundary. Based on recent modeling studies on ammonoid paleobiogeography and taxonomic diversity, we demonstrate that the late Early Triassic (Smithian and Spathian) was a time of a major climate change. More precisely, the end Smithian climate can be characterized by a warm and equable climate underlined by a flat, pole-to-equator, sea surface temperature (SST) gradient, while the steep Spathian SST gradient suggests latitudinally differentiated climatic conditions. Moreover, sedimentary evidence suggests a transition from a humid and hot climate during the Smithian to a dryer climate from the Spathian onwards. By analogy with comparable carbon isotope perturbations in the Late Devonian, Jurassic and Cretaceous we propose that high atmospheric CO2 levels could have been responsible for the observed carbon cycle disturbance at the Smithian-Spathian boundary. We suggest that the end Smithian ammonoid extinction has been essentially caused by a warm and equable climate related to an increased CO2 flux possibly originating from a short eruptive event of the Siberian igneous province. This increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations could have additionally reduced the marine calcium carbonate oversaturation and weakened the calcification potential of marine organisms, including ammonoids, in late Smithian oceans. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Katsev2006,
abstract = {A diagenetic reaction-transport model was used to simulate how the sediment redox boundary migrates in response to persistent or episodic changes in the deposition flux of degradable organic matter and the concentration of oxygen in the overlying bottom water. The position of the redox boundary is represented by the depth of oxygen penetration. The simulations reveal that the position of the redox boundary in organic-poor sediments, such as those in the deep basins of the Arctic Ocean, is highly sensitive to the flux of organic matter: relatively small and/or brief increases in that flux can cause the redox boundary to migrate rapidly from deep within the sediment to within a few centimeters of the sediment–water interface. Reoxidation of the sediment column after such an event can take years. Redox fluctuations can redistribute solid-phase manganese within the sediment column and produce multiple concentration peaks in its depth profile on a decadal time scale. Manganese peaks observed in sediment cores from the deep basins of the Arctic Ocean do not necessarily correspond to the position of the redox boundary during previous climatic periods or reflect historical changes in manganese deposition rates. The model supports the hypothesis that the recent decrease in the Arctic ice cover has increased the flux of organic matter to the seafloor and moved the redox boundary close to the sediment–water interface. The presence of iron sulfides at depths significantly below the bioturbated layer suggests that either the Arctic sediments have been anoxic for millennia, or iron and sulfate are reduced at these depths by dissolved organic matter diffusing downward from the bioturbation zone.},

abstract = {The global Mesozoic sea-level rise contributed to the stepwise flooding of the Central European Basin (CEB) across the T-J transition and transformed the CEB from a late Triassic inland playa to an early Jurassic semi-enclosed inland sea. The calibration of sections from North Germany and Thuringia using high-resolution palynomorph and ammonite biostratigraphy contributes to the improved temporal and spatial resolution of this decisive period. The herein proposed Deltoidospora-Concavisporites (DC) Zone, placed between the Rhaetian Ricciisporites-Polypodiisporites (RP) Zone and the Hettangian Pinuspollenites-Trachysporites Zone, marks the transitional zone of overlapping Rhaetian and Hettangian palynomorphs in brackish-marine, brackish and terrestrial environments of the North German Basin (NGB). Thus, the DC Zone enables the identification of the T-J transition in the NGB. Following a short-term ingression in the late Norian Corollina-Porcellispora Subzone, the first Rhaetian transgression contributed to substantial marine-terrestrial facies shifts. The diachronous transgressive onlap of brackish-marine strata culminated in a first Rhaetian maximum flooding in the upper Corollina-Enzonalasporites Zone to lower Rhaetipollis-Limbosporites (RL) Zone. After a regressive maximum in the middle RL Zone, the next transgression culminated in a second Rhaetian maximum flooding in the upper RL Zone. Following the end-Triassic regression, herein assigned to the upper RP Zone, the diachronous transgressive onlap of marine shales marks the change to marine Jurassic environments. The herein proposed Deltoidospora-Concavisporites (DC) Zone, placed between the Rhaetian Ricciisporites-Polypodiisporites (RP) Zone and the Hettangian Pinuspollenites-Trachysporites Zone, marks the transitional zone of overlapping Rhaetian and Hettangian palynomorphs in brackish-marine, brackish and terrestrial environments of the North German Basin (NGB). Thus, the DC Zone enables the identification of the T-J transition in the NGB. At the western gate of the CEB, the onset of marine Hettangian strata with ammonites, dated as the P. erugatum Biohorizon at St. Audrie's Bay, postdates the base Hettangian GSSP by {\~{}} 250 kyr. From there to Thuringia, the diachronous onlap of marine Hettangian strata with ammonites, herein dated as the P. plicatulum Biohorizon, took place over {\~{}} 100 kyr. The first Jurassic maximum flooding is dated as the interval of the P. psilonotum to P. plicatulum Biohorizons (lower Planorbis Zone). Rhaetian–Hettangian 3rd-order sequences of the CEB correlate with contemporaneous sequences described from Tethyan and peri-Tethyan basins pointing to circum-Tethyan eustatic cycles. The 4th-order sequences are evident in the Rhaetian-Hettangian, but only a set of Rhaetian 4th-order sequences can be correlated in the NGB so far.},

abstract = {At Site U1385, drilled during IODP Expedition 339 off the coast of Portugal on the continental slope, high-resolution sulfate concentration measurements in the pore fluids display non-steady-state behavior. At this site there is a zone of sulfate reduction in the uppermost seven meters of sediment, followed by a 38-meter interval where sulfate concentrations do not change, and finally sulfate concentrations are depleted to zero between 45 and 55. meters below seafloor. Below the sulfate minimum zone, there is abundant methane, suggesting that the lower sulfate consumption zone is coupled to anaerobic methane oxidation. We analyze pore water samples from IODP Site U1385 for sulfur and oxygen isotope ratios of dissolved sulfate, as well as the sulfur isotope composition of sedimentary pyrite. The sulfur isotopes in pore fluid sulfate display similar non-steady-state behavior similar to that of the sulfate concentrations, increasing over the uppermost zone of sulfate reduction and again over the lower zone of sulfate-driven anaerobic methane oxidation. The oxygen isotopes in sulfate increase to the 'apparent equilibrium' value in the uppermost zone of sulfate reduction and do not change further. Our calculations support the idea that sulfite to sulfide reduction is the limiting step in microbial sulfate reduction, and that the isotope fractionation expressed in the residual pore water sulfate pool is inversely proportional to the net sulfate reduction rate. The sulfur isotope composition of pyrite acquires one value in the uppermost sediments, which may be overprinted by a second value in the deeper sediments, possibly due to iron release during anaerobic methane oxidation or iron diffusion from a higher zone of bacterial iron reduction. Our results have implications for modeling the sulfur isotope composition of the pyrite burial flux in the global biogeochemical sulfur cycle.},

The scheme recognizes seven operationally derived iron pools: (1) carbonate associated Fe (Fecarb), including siderite and ankerite; (2) easily reducible oxides (Feox1), including ferrihydrite and lepidocrocite; (3) reducible oxides (Feox2), including goethite, hematite and akagan??ite; (4) magnetite (Femag); (5) poorly reactive sheet silicate Fe (FePRS); (6) pyrite Fe (Fepy); and (7) unreactive silicate Fe (FeU). As such, this is the first extraction scheme specifically developed to allow the separate identification of magnetite, and the first to allow a complete evaluation of Fe carbonate phases such as siderite and ankerite. The scheme was developed following tests on pure mineral phases to evaluate the minerals solubilized by each technique and to determine optimum extraction times. Further tests on mixtures of pure minerals and on grain-size separated sediments from two major US rivers and two glacial meltwaters validate the specificity of the scheme for different pools of iron minerals, and demonstrate a high degree of reproducibility for each analytical stage. The data obtained for the riverine and glacial sediments are additionally discussed in relation to the dominant modes of transport of different iron minerals in fine-grained continental sediments. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluated interbasinal deep-sea benthic foraminiferal $\delta$ 13 C gradients between the Pacific (Site 1210) and Atlantic (Site 1262) oceans as a proxy for changes in export productivity. The interbasinal $\delta$ 13 C gradient was reduced after the mass extinction, suggesting a reduction in global export productivity. Although our data support the Living Ocean hypothesis, evidence from paleoupwelling zones shows significant export productivity, indicating spatial heterogeneity in the wake of the K/Pg mass extinction (Heterogeneous Ocean).},

abstract = {The detection of diagenetic alteration is critical for palaeoclimate reconstruction that is based on the oxygen isotope composition of fossil bones and teeth. So far, no direct chemical proxy has been found to track diagenetic modification of the oxygen isotope ratios. Here, a new approach to identify diagenetic changes of $\delta$18OPO4 values in skeletal apatite of small mammals by means of triple oxygen isotope analysis (16O, 17O and18O) is presented. Our method is based on the fact that inhaled air oxygen (O2) has an isotope anomaly on its rare isotope 17O. Inhaled air O2 is a major source of oxygen in small land-living mammals. A fraction of the anomaly is transferred via body water to skeletal apatite, where it can be detected by means of $\delta$17O and $\delta$18O analyses. The approach, considering the current analytical uncertainty, is restricted to small mammals with body masses≤1 kg. This is due to the low specific metabolic rates of large mammals, resulting in a lower fraction of oxygen inhaled via breathing relative to oxygen from other sources in their body water. Remnant negative 17O anomalies derived from in vivo inhaled O2 have been detected in enamel bioapatite of Eocene to Miocene rodent teeth while dentine of the same teeth lacks significant 17O anomalies. This suggests preservation of the original phosphate oxygen isotope composition in enamel of these smallmammal teeth. In contrast, 17O anomalies in dentine have been erased due to diagenetic alteration with isotopically normal diagenetic fluids. Triple oxygen isotope analysis of bioapatite thus seems to be a useful new proxy to directly detect diagenetic alterations of the $\delta$18OPO4 values of small mammal teeth.},

abstract = {A 1 m thick carbonate crust, layered and commonly domal, caps crinoidal limestones on reef complexes of the top Permian Changxing Formation in the Huaying Mountains, eastern Sichuan, China. The crust's stratigraphic level lies at a sharp change in facies, and is overlain by poorly fossiliferous laminated micrites and shales of the Lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation. The crust therefore appears to coincide with the end-Permian extinction event, although the dating of the strata is currently imprecise. The crust is composed mostly of digitate carbonate, locally thrombolitic, with remnant lobate fabric, and resembles microbialites, but is mostly recrystallised and a microbial origin is unconfirmed. It is enclosed in micrite with pyrite crystals, ostracode and other shell debris. The crust is absent from interreef areas. Previous interpretations of karstification and calcrete formation are not upheld, and the facies were deposited under water. Overlying sediments are low energy, with abundant ferroan calcite and pyrite, reflecting anoxia associated with rising sea level. Various interpretations of the crust are possible: (1) it was organic, and microbia grew preferentially on topographic highs of reef tops; (2) microbia were a disaster biota in the absence of grazers; (3) microbia took advantage of favourable conditions for calcification, associated with a rapidly rising environmental-CO2 content during the Late Permian; (4) the crust was an inorganic precipitate associated with CO2-rich water. Microbial crusts are rare after the Cambrian, but whether this crust is organic or not, its presence in these strata reinforces the view that oceanic-atmospheric conditions in the Permian-Triassic boundary interval were unusual.},

abstract = {Vertical gradients in the $\delta$13C of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon ($\delta$$\delta$13CDIC) can be estimated for paleomarine systems based on $\delta$13Ccarb data from sections representing a range of depositional water depths. An analysis of eight Lower Triassic sections from the northern Yangtze Platform and Nanpanjiang Basin, representing water depths of {\~{}}50 to 500m, allowed reconstruction of $\delta$$\delta$13CDIC in Early Triassic seas of the South China craton for seven time slices representing four negative (N) and three positive (P) carbon-isotope excursions: 8.5{\%} (N1), 5.8{\%} (P1), 3.5{\%} (N2), 6.5{\%} (P2), 7.8{\%} (N3), -1.9{\%} (P3), and 2.2{\%} (N4). These values are much larger than vertical $\delta$13CDIC gradients in the modern ocean ({\~{}}1-3{\%}) due to intensified stratification and reduced vertical mixing in Early Triassic seas. Peaks in $\delta$$\delta$13CDIC around the PTB (N1) and in the early to mid-Smithian (P2-N3) coincided with episodes of strong climatic warming, reduced marine productivity, and expanded ocean anoxia. The Dienerian-Smithian boundary marks the onset of a major mid-Early Triassic disturbance, commencing {\~{}}1Myr after the latest Permian mass extinction, that we link to a second eruptive stage of the Siberian Traps. Inhospitable oceanic conditions generally persisted until the early Spathian, when strong climatic cooling caused re-invigoration of global-ocean circulation, leading to an interval of negative $\delta$$\delta$13CDIC values and a sharp increase in $\delta$13Ccarb driven by upwelling of nutrient-rich deepwaters. These developments marked the end of the main eruptive stage of the Siberian Traps. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A biogeochemical traverse is presented for a juvenile benthic mat covering the depth profile of an artificially stratified and eutrophicated hypersaline heliothermal pond with known gradients of temperature, salinity, pH, and light transmission. It can be shown that visual mat development depends primarily on temperature and salinity as main environmental steering variables whose increase with depth goes along with the attenuation and final disappearance of a visible microbial film in the pond's hypolimnic compartment. Recorded biogeochemical parameters (Corgcontent, cell numbers, chlorophyll-a content) evidently reflect, as either biomass- or productivity-related index functions, the visually perceptible growth gradient of the microbial ecosystem along the pond slope. The observed coincidence of maxima in these index functions with maxima in $\delta$13Corgclearly identifies high rates of primary productivity as the agent ultimately responsible for the generation of isotopically heavy (13C-enriched) biomass in these and related environments. Extreme demands placed on the local feeder pool of dissolved inorganic carbon by high rates of primary productivity entertained by the mat-forming microbenthos obviously give rise to severe CO2limitation, enforcing the operation of a diffusion-(supply-)limited assimilatory pathway with an isotopically indiscriminate metabolization of the available CO2resources. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

abstract = {Marine biodiversity decreases and ecosystem destruction during the end-Permian mass extinction (EPME) have been linked to widespread marine euxinic conditions. Changes in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), and marine dissolved sulfate concentrations during the Permian-Triassic transition can provide insights into the role of ocean chemistry change in the largest mass extinction in Earth history. In this study, we constrain marine dissolved sulfate concentrations using the MSR-trend method of Algeo et al. [Algeo, T.J., Luo, G.M., Song, H.Y., Lyons, T.W., Canfield, D.E., 2015. Reconstruction of secular variation in seawater sulfate concentrations. Biogeosciences 12, 2131–2151] on sulfur (S) isotope records from Iran (the Kuh-e-Ali Bashi and Zal sections) and Hungary (the B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny North and B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny East sections). This empirically derived transfer function is based on the S isotope fractionation between sulfate and sulfide associated with MSR in natural aquatic environments. This fractionation is proxied by the difference in S-isotope compositions between chromium-reducible sulfur (CRS) and carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), i.e., $\Delta$34SCAS-CRS. We show that, despite region-specific redox conditions, $\Delta$34SCAS-CRS exhibits a nearly invariant value of 15–16‰ in both study sections. By comparing our record with a $\Delta$34Ssulfate-sulfide density distribution for modern marine sediments, we deduce that porewater Rayleigh distillation, carbonate diagenesis, and other effects are unlikely to have appreciably altered the S-isotope offset between CRS and CAS in the study sections. In addition, differences in sedimentary regimes and organic carbon (OC) fluxes between the Iranian and Hungarian sections exclude major influence of the electron donor on MSR-S isotope fractionation and point to a more universal control, i.e., contemporaneous seawater sulfate concentration. The MSR-trend transfer function yielded estimates of seawater sulfate of 0.6–2.8mM for the latest Permian to earliest Triassic, suggesting a balanced oceanic S-cycle with equal S inputs and outputs and no major changes in sulfate concentrations during this interval. However, a secular trend toward heavier $\delta$34SCAS (by {\textgreater}5‰) in the earliest Triassic can be explained only by increasing the turnover rate of the S-cycle (by ca. one order of magnitude) and a concomitant change in terrestrial S sources in a box model experiment. Exposure of evaporite deposits having a high $\delta$34S may account for the source change, with a possible role for the Siberian Traps volcanism by magmatic remobilization of Cambrian rock salt. A high sulfur cycle turnover rate would have left the ocean system vulnerable to development of widespread euxinic conditions, posing a sustained threat to marine life during the Early Triassic.},

abstract = {While the end-Permian extinction in the marine realm is well known from the Tethys Ocean, it remains little studied in the vast Panthalassic Ocean. Opal Creek, Alberta, Canada is a biostratigraphically continuous Permian– Triassic Boundary (PTB) section that is interpreted to have been deposited in a deep outer shelf setting along the Panthalassicwestern margin of Pangaea. Signi!cant organic carbon and nitrogen isotope excursions precede the extinction of the dominant Late Permian benthic organisms (siliceous sponges). Geochemical comparison with underlying Guadalupian age rocks and analysis of the conodont fauna suggest that the latest Permian at Opal Creek records the shutdown of a productive cold-water upwelling ecosystem with a mid-water column oxygen minimum followed by the transition to a warm and less vigorously circulating system with a bottom-water oxygen minimum. The transition from a low-diversity, cold-water conodont fauna in the Middle Permian to a more diverse latest Permian fauna containing equatorial species coincides with a transition from elevated !15N values characteristic of coastal zones with denitri!cation in a mid-water oxygen minimum to more normal marine values. A spike in the !13C of organic carbon following a latest Permian marine transgression alongwestern Pangaea is here attributed to transient increased productivity in the photic zone preceding the main extinction, likely related to the synergistic effects of warming, increased nutrient runoff, and residual upwelling. This is followed by an equilibration to lower !13Corg values characteristic of a lower productivity regime in the Early Triassic.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analyses of carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb) and total organic carbon (TOC; $\delta$13Corg), together with geochemical analyses of 54 major, minor, and trace elements and magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on whole rock samples of the undisturbed Permian–Triassic (P/Tr) limestone boundary sequence in the Idrijca Valley (W. Slovenia). At the P/Tr boundary, there is a 0.8-cm thick clayey marl layer (PTB) showing a characteristic magnetic susceptibility pulse and considerable enrichment in most major, minor, and trace elements. The P/Tr transition is characterized by (1) an abrupt decrease in sedimentation rate from 32 to 5 cm/100 ka, (2) a well known prominent negative excursion of $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg, reflecting global perturbations in the carbon cycle, and (3) the drastic disappearance of typically Upper Permian marine fauna.  Although the shape of the $\delta$13Ccarb curve indicates gradual long-term change across the P/Tr boundary, the sharp negative $\delta$13Corg anomaly within an interval from 30 cm below to 6 cm above the boundary suggests an interruption of those gradual processes.  Our observations for selected redox sensitive elements (Mo, U, V and Zn), abundances for organic carbon and sulphur and the rare earth elements (REE) distribution in the boundary sequence, as well as the shape of the Ce/Ce* curve suggest that oceanic anoxia was typical of the Upper Permian, and that the transition to oxygenated conditions occurred at the P/Tr boundary. Oxygenation at the P/Tr transition is coincidental with the terminal phase of the Upper Permian marine regression. The shape of the Ce/Ce* curve indicates that the redox environmental conditions changed again in the earliest Triassic, resulting once more in oxygen deficient conditions. },

abstract = {The evolution of complex life over the past 600 million years was disrupted by at least five mass extinctions, one of which occurred at the close of the Triassic period. The end-Triassic extinction corresponds to a period of high atmospheric-CO2 concentrations caused by massive volcanism and biomass burning; most extinction scenarios invoke the resulting environmental perturbations in accounting for the loss of marine and terrestrial biodiversity. Here we reconstruct changes in Tethyan shallow marine ecosystems and ocean redox chemistry from earliest Jurassic (Hettangian)-aged black shales from Germany and Luxemburg. The shales contain increased concentrations of the biomarker isorenieratane, a fossilized pigment from green sulphur bacteria. The abundance of green sulphur bacteria suggests that the photic zone underwent prolonged periods of high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide. This interval is also marked by the proliferation of green algae, an indicator of anoxia. We conclude that the redox changes in the entire water column reflect sluggish circulation in marginal regions of the Tethys Ocean. We suggest that the resultant repeated poisoning of shallow epicontinental seas—hotspots of Mesozoic biodiversity—with hydrogen sulphide may have slowed the recovery of marine ecosystems during the Early Jurassic.$\backslash$nView full text},

abstract = {Fabric and pyrite framboid size analysis of Permian to Jurassic samples from the Mino-Tamba terrane of Japan provide an 80 myr redox history from the Panthalassa Ocean. Fully oxygenated conditions dominated but were punctuated by three phases of anoxia (euxinia) during the Permo-Triassic boundary, the late Early Triassic (Spathian Stage) and the late Early Jurassic (Toarcian Stage). A Permo-Triassic superanoxic event of 10 myr duration is thus resolved into a complex redox history of dysoxic-anoxic background conditions punctuated by short-lived euxinic pulses. Both the end-Permian and Toarcian anoxic episodes began abruptly with the development of siliceous claystones, characterized by a framboid-dominated pyrite fraction and no organic C enrichment, interpreted to record euxinic conditions. These facies are overlain by organic-rich shales with slightly larger framboids, more crystalline pyrite and bioturbation indicating accumulation beneath a better-ventilated, higher productivity water column. Thus, an initial phase of ocean-wide stagnation was followed by improved circulation attributed to the onset of warm saline bottom water circulation. Five radiolarian crises during our study interval show a complex relationship with redox conditions. The latest Permian mass extinction coincided with the onset of ocean euxinia but two other crises (Middle Permian and end Triassic), occurred during fully oxygenated intervals. Radiolarian radiation events are also not consistently linked with redox conditions: diversification in the early Late Permian coincides with the onset of weakly dysoxic conditions, late Early Triassic and late Early Jurassic radiations coincide with euxinic events, and the basal Jurassic radiation occurred during a fully oxic phase. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Theoretical considerations (i.e., partition coefficients, water/rock ratio, chemistry of interstitial meteoric water) of elemental behaviour during diagenetic stabilization with meteoric waters suggests that it leads to a decrease in strontium, sodium, and possibly magnesium and an increase in manganese, iron, and zinc in progressively altered carbonates. Such elemental behaviour is exhibited by the different carbonate components of the Mississippian Burlington Limestone of Iowa and Missouri and the Silurian Read Bay Formation of Arctic Canada. In the Burlington Limestone the rock matrix (e.g., biosparite), the enclosed crinoids, and to some degree the rugose corals are chemically similar. The crinoid ossicles have average strontium content of 160 ppm, rugose corals 180 ppm, and the enclosing biosparite 120 ppm. In contrast, in the Read Bay Formation each of the above mentioned components has a specific chemistry, with 210 ppm strontium for crinoids, 780 ppm for rugose corals, and 360 ppm for their enclosing micrite matrix. These chemical trends are accompanied by textural changes of the host carbonate sediments. In the Burlington Limestone this involves the presence of depositional sparite, whereas in the Read Bay Formation this increase in textural maturity involves the transition from micrite to microspar to minor pseudospar and sparite. The combination of these textural trends with the elemental patterns shows that the degree with which a particular carbonate component approaches either the open system or the partly closed system equilibrium is dictated by its respective mineralogical stability and the water/rock ratio. While the results show that the carbonate assemblage may act as a completely open diagenetic system (e.g., Burlington Limestone), available data for the majority of studied sequences (e.g., Read Bay Formation) suggest that diagenetic equilibration ceases while some original depositional differences in chemical composition are still preserved. This implies that diagenetic stabilization proceeds through partly closed reaction zones on solid-liquid interfaces. Transfer of the chemical and textural information from the dissolving phase (original sedimentary carbonate particle) to the precipitating phase (diagenetic carbonate component) proceeds via a Messenger Film water in the reaction zone, which is in disequilibrium with the meteoric bulk aquifer water. Thus the chemical composition of carbonate components of ancient limestones may serve as a potential tool for evaluating the degree of diagenesis and for deducing the original mineralogy of the different stabilized carbonate phases. Application of this trace element model suggests that Paleozoic crinoids were composed originally of metastable high-magnesium calcite, rugose corals were composed originally of stable low-magnesium calcite or high-magnesium calcite with low Mg (super 2+) content, and micrite was origially aragonite lime mud.},

abstract = {Changes in hydrological conditions are expected and may alter carbon cycling in peatlands. Peat aeration with water table change has not commonly been investigated, and the water table is often assumed to constitute the oxic-anoxic boundary in peat. We analyzed temperature, moisture, oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in profiles of a temperate fen during two seasons. A drying-rewetting cycle and flooding were induced and compared to controls. The response of moisture and water table position varied greatly and was related to gradients of peat compaction and ash content. Background drought raised air-filled porosity (AFP) to a maximum of 15{\%}–38{\%} in shallow peat and experimental drought up to 50{\%}. Decline in water table and soil moisture broadly led to O2 penetration and CO2 degassing, and rewetting and flooding led to anoxic conditions and CO2 accumulation in peat pore water. In dense peat with ≥20{\%} ash content the unsaturated zone remained partly low in oxygen, however, and up to 5{\%} AFP and 20 cm above water table O2 concentrations frequently remained below 50 $\mu$mol L−1. Moderately intense and short drying did not induce substantial oxygen penetration in the compacted soil profiles. The likelihood of the presence of oxygen in the peat was predicted by logistic regression using water table and ash content or bulk density as predictors (p {\textless} 0.0005). The model is potentially useful for predicting the position of the redoxcline in peat deposits and may assist in improving statistical models of trace gas emission from peatlands.},

abstract = {A general circulation model with a highly idealized geometry is used to investigate which fundamentally different equilibria of the global thermohaline circulation may exist. The model comprises two identical basins representing the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, which are connected by a circumpolar channel in the south. The model circulation is driven, in addition to wind forcing, by restoring the sea surface temperature to prescribed values and specified freshwater fluxes in the surface salinity budget (mixed boundary conditions). The boundary conditions are symmetric with respect to the equator and identical for both oceans. Four fundamentally different, stable steady states are found under the same set of boundary conditions. Two of the equilibria show both oceans in the same state, with high-latitude deep-water formation occuring either in both northern or in both southern oceans, respectively. Two additional equilibria exist in which the thermohaline circulations of the basins differ fundamentally from each other: one ocean forms deep water at northern high latitudes, while the other has a much weaker circulation with sinking in the Southern Hemisphere. One of these equilibria qualitatively corresponds to today's global thermohaline circulation pattern (conveyor belt). It is demonstrated that a transition from one equilibrium to another can be accomplished by relatively small differences in the freshwater fluxes. The preference and sensitivity of the steady states depends critically on the freshwater forcing applied.},

abstract = {Records of more than 20 Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) sections from South China show that widespread end-Permian regression took place in whole South China. Timing of the low ebb of this regression was pinpointed to the Clarkina meishanensis and Hindeodus changxingensis zones. Biostratigraphic and paleogeographic studies at conodont zonation level reveal that the Yangtze Carbonate Platform and isolated small carbonate platforms in the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi (HGG) Basin experienced sedimentary hiatus during these two zones which lasted about 50-100 kya. Meanwhile the basinal areas, namely the Northern Marginal Basin of Yangtze Platform and the Hunan-Guizhou-Guangxi Basin, have continuous conodont zonation with silicious and ashbed deposits. The basinal areas show two negative $\delta$13C shifts during the PTB interval from Clarkina yini zone to Isarcicella isarcica zone, while on the platforms there is usually only one negative shift because the early shift at C. meishanensis zone was lost during hiatus. The end-Permian regression and successive rapid transgression taking place at the PTB casted important effects to the pattern and process of the PTB mass extinction. The depositional hiatus hitherto underestimated will necessitate reassessment of some interpretations on the causes and results of that extinction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Dolomitization and related anhydrite cementation can complicate the characterization of carbonate reservoirs. Both processes have affected the Permo-Triassic Upper Dalan 2013 Kangan carbonates, the main reservoir at the South Pars gasfield, offshore Iran. The carbonates were deposited in a shallow-marine ramp or epeiric platform and, according to previous studies, underwent intense near-surface diagenesis and minor burial modification. Detailed petrographical and geochemical analyses indicate that dolomitization and anhydrite precipitation can be explained in terms of the sabkha/seepage-reflux models. The early dolomites then re-equilibrated or re-crystallized in a shallow burial setting. Evaluation of poroperm values in different reservoir intervals indicates that replacive dolomitization in the absence of anhydrite precipitation or with only patchy anhydrite has enhanced the reservoir quality. Where anhydrite cement is pervasive and has plugged the rock fabric, poroperm values are significantly decreased. As emphasized in previous studies and confirmed here, dolomitization and anhydrite cementation, together with original facies type, are the major factors controlling reservoir quality in the Dalan 2013 Kangan carbonates at South Pars. When associated with minor anhydrite cementation, replacive dolomitization has enhanced reservoir quality by increasing permeability. However, porosity in fabric-retentive dolomite was apparently inherited from the precursor rock and therefore reflects the original depositional environment. Low-temperature dolomitization is commonly fabric-selective and partially fabric-retentive. Whole rock stable isotope thermometry indicates that fabric-destructive dolomites in the reservoir rocks formed at temperatures above 22°C, whereas fabric-retentive dolomites and associated anhydrites formed in surface and near-surface conditions. Fabric-destructive dolomite or dolomite neomorphism post-date fabric-retentive dolomite and continued to form in deep burial conditions (223C1400m). These observations may explain why fabric-retentive dolomite and anhydrite fabrics are traversed by stylolites.},

The thermodynamic study of ferrihydrite is important for understanding geochemical transformations involving iron as well as in the study of iron in chemical synthesis and biological systems. In this study, the heat capacity of a synthetic two-line ferrihydrite, which showed typically broad X-ray diffraction peaks due to small particle size and/or disorder but had a rather low excess water content, FeOOH{\textperiodcentered}0.027H2O, was measured over the temperature range of (2 to 300) K. Using these data, the standard molar entropy, Smo, of this two-line ferrihydrite was calculated to be (71.7 ± 0.2) J {\textperiodcentered} K-1{\textperiodcentered} mol-1, while that of the stoichiometric (no excess water) material, FeOOH was estimated to be (69.8 ± 0.2) J {\textperiodcentered} K-1{\textperiodcentered} mol-1. These measured entropies are in moderate agreement with, though slightly higher, than those estimated much more indirectly by Majzlan et al. (2004) [15] The heat capacity data below T = 12 K were fit to theoretical models to study the underlying contributions to the heat capacity. The fit required an anisotropic ferrimagnetic spin wave component, which agrees with studies that characterize two-line ferrihydrite as a ferrimagnet. The fit also required a linear term, which most likely stems from defects in the ferrihydrite particles. Using enthalpy of formation from the elements -(542.3 ± 0.8 kJ {\textperiodcentered} mol-1for FeOOH{\textperiodcentered}0.027H2O or -(534.6 ± 1.0) kJ {\textperiodcentered} mol-1for FeOOH obtained from acid solution calorimetry of the same sample, the standard Gibbs energy of formation from the elements for this ferrihydrite sample was calculated to be -(473.0 ± 1.0) kJ {\textperiodcentered} mol-1for FeOOH{\textperiodcentered}0.027H2O and -(465.3 ± 1.0) kJ {\textperiodcentered} mol-1for FeOOH. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Elemental variations among the major components are compatible with a differential response to diagenesis governed by the relative stability of the original mineralogy of the component. However, among the most stable, low-Mg calcite brachiopods, the relationship between textural preservation and trace element content is complex. This apparent complexity may be due at least partially to our method of textural characterization of whole brachipod samples. The nonluminescent portions of a set of well-preserved brachipods have textural characteristics and elemental contents which are virtually indistinguishable from modern representatives. Consequently, their delta 18 O values (-3.7 + or - 0.2 per thousand ) are assumed to represent primary biogenic calcite. These delta 18 O values are in the heavy end of the range of values from texturally well-preserved whole brachiopods (-6.6 to -2.5 per thousand ), texturally altered whole brachiopods (-6.7 to -3.7 per thousand ), and texturally altered crinoids and corals (-6.7 to -2.7 per thousand ). This comparison suggests that marine-derived pore waters were a predominant component during the principal phase of diagenesis. The relatively low delta l8 O values of well-preserved brachiopods compared with modern representatives implies that Middle Devonian seawater was either warmer (by about 10 degrees C) or depleted in 18 O (by about 2-3 per thousand ) relative to modern seawater.},

abstract = {The Carboniferous-Permian Dwyka Group in southern Namibia is subdivided into four upward-fining deglaciation sequences, each of which is capped by fine-grained glaciolacustrine or glaciomarine deposits. Both the second and the third deglaciation sequences are associated with mudstone units that are particularly widespread—the Ganigobis Shale Member and the Hardap Shale Member. An abundance of marine macrofossils and ichnofossils and extrabasinally derived fallout tuff horizons characterize these mudstones and provide the basis for an integrated high-resolution biostratigraphic and tephrostratigraphic framework.Juvenile magmatic zircons separated from tuff horizons at the base of the Ganigobis Shale Member (top deglaciation sequence II) yield 206Pb/238U sensitive high-resolution ion microprobe (SHRIMP) ages of 302.3 ± 2.1, 302.0 ± 3.0 Ma, and 299.5 ± 3.1 Ma, whereas a tuff associated with the upper part of the Hardap Shale Member (top deglaciation sequence III) reveals a SHRIMP age of 297.1 ± 1.8 Ma. Since macrofaunal occurrences reveal the Hardap Shale Member to be a correlative of the Gondwana-wide Eurydesma transgression, this datum is an important age calibration for a well-established global event. Tuff beds sampled next to the boundary between the glacial Dwyka Group and the postglacial Ecca Group yield SHRIMP ages of 290.9 ± 1.7 Ma and 288.5 ± 1.6 Ma, providing an age proxy for the end of the late Paleozoic ice age in southern Africa.},

abstract = {A simple model of the CaCO (sub 3) saturation state of the ocean is presented. It can be solved analytically and is intended to identify the fundamental controls on ocean carbonate ion concentration. It should also attract researchers unfamiliar with complex biogeochemical models. Despite its limitations, the model-calculated CaCO (sub 3) saturation state of today's ocean agrees well with observations. In general, the model reveals three distinctly different modes of operation: The "Strangelove Ocean" of high supersaturation which is dominated by inorganic CaCO (sub 3) precipitation, (2) the "Neritan Ocean" of indefinite saturation dominated by biogenic shallow-water CaCO (sub 3) precipitation, and (3) the "Cretan Ocean" of low saturation dominated by biogenic pelagic CaCO (sub 3) precipitation. In the latter mode, the deep ocean [CO (sub 3) (super 2-) ] is remarkably stable, provided that the biogenic production of CaCO (sub 3) exceeds the riverine flux of Ca (super 2+) and CO (sub 3) (super 2-) . This explains the overall constancy of the saturation state of the ocean documented over the last 100 Ma. The model is then used to address diverse questions. One important result is that the recovery of the oceanic carbonate chemistry from fossil fuel neutralization in the future will be accelerated due to expected reduced biogenic calcification.},

abstract = {Maps of the paleography of Iran are presented to summarize and review the geological evolution of the Iranian region since late Precambrian time. On the basis of the data presented, reconstructions of the region have been prepared that take account of the known major movements of continental masses. These reconstructions show some striking features, many of which were poorly appreciated previously in the evolution of the region. With the disappearance of the Hercynian Ocean, the floor of the High-Zagros Alpine Ocean started to subduct beneath southern Central Iran and apparently disappeared by Late Cretaceous-Early Paleocene time. From this time the compressional motion between Arabia and Eurasia has been accommodated in Iran by shortening and thickening of the continental crust. This crustal thickening is accompanied by a progressive, though eventful, transition from marine to continental conditions. A striking feature highlighted in this study is the existence of extensive alkaline and calc-alkaline volcanics, which appear to be unrelated to subduction. Refs.},

abstract = {The making of Pangea is the result of large-scale amalgamation of continents and micro-continents, which started at the end of the Neoproterozoic with the formation of Gondwana. As pieces were added to Gondwana on its South-American, Antarctica and Australia side, ribbon-like micro-continents were detached from its African and South-Chinese side: Cadomia in the late Neoproterozoic, Avalonia and Hunia in the Ordovician, Galatia in the Devonian and Cimmeria in the Permian. Cadomia was re-accreted to Gondwana, but the other ribbon-continents were accreted to Baltica, North-China, Laurussia or Laurasia. Finding the origin of these numerous terranes is a major geological challenge. Recently, a global plate tectonic model was developed together with a large geological/geodynamic database, at the Lausanne University, covering the last 600. Ma of the Earth's history. Special attention was given to the placing of Gondwana derived terranes in their original position, using all possible constraints. We propose here a solution for the Variscan terranes, another paper deals with the Altaids. The Galatian super-terrane was detached from Gondwana in the Devonian, during the opening of Paleotethys, and was quickly separated into four sub-terranes that started to by-pass each other. The leading terranes collided at the end of the Devonian with the Hanseatic terrane detached from Laurussia. In the Carboniferous, Gondwana started to impinge onto the amalgamated terranes, creating the Variscan chain and the Pangean super-continent. East of Spain Paleotethys remained opened until the Triassic, subducting northward under Laurasia. Roll-back of the Paleotethyan slab triggered the collapse of most of the European Variscan orogen, which was replaced by series of Permian rifts, some of them becoming oceanized back-arc basins during the Triassic. Major force changes at the Pangean plate limits at the end of the Triassic provoked its break-up, through the opening of the proto-Caribbean, central-Atlantic, Alpine-Tethys oceanic seaways. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Carbon, oxygen and sulphur isotope data for transects across two pyrite-bearmg carbonate concretions, and their host sediments, from the Upper Lias of N.E. England show symmetrical zonation. $\delta$13CPDB values of the calcite cement (-12.9 to -15.4{\%}.) indicate that most of it originated from organic matter by bacterial reduction of sulphate, augmented with marine and, to a lesser extent, fermentation derived carbonate. Organic carbon ($\delta$13CPDB = -26.1 to -37.0{\%}.). reflects the admixture of allochtho-nous terrestrial organic matter with marine material and the selective preservation of isotopically light organic material through microbiological degradation. Two phases of pyrite are present in each concretion. The earlier framboidal pyrite formed throughout the sediment prior to concretionary growth and has $\delta$34SCD values of -22 to -26{\%}. indicating formation by open system sulphate reduction. The later euhedral phase is more abundant and reaches values of - 2.5 to - 5.5{\%}. at concretion margins. This phase of sulphate reduction provided the carbonate source for concretionary growth and occurred in a partially closed system. The $\delta$13C and $\delta$34S data are consistent with mineralogical and chemical evidence which suggest that both concretions formed close to the sediment surface. The $\delta$18O values of the calcite in one concretion ($\delta$18OPDB = 2.3 to -4.8{\%}.) indicate precipitation in pore waters whose temperature and isotopic composition was close to that of overlying seawater. The other concretion is isotopically much lighter ($\delta$18OPDB-8.9 to -9.9{\%}.) and large $\delta$18O differences between concretions in closely-spaced horizons imply that local factors control the isotopic composition of pore waters. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Equations are developed for the calculation of the simultaneous variations in trace element concentrations and radiogenic and stable isotopic compositions that occur during water-rock interaction. The equations are of general use for modeling chemical and isotopic variations in porous media and are applied here to the diagenesis of carbonate rocks and sediments. The variables which control the ultimate geochemical composition of diagenetic carbonates include the composition of the original sediment and fluid, water:rock ratio, fractionation factors, distribution coefficients, open vs. closed system behavior, and porosity. Owing to the extreme differences in the concentrations of oxygen and carbon in diagenetic fluids, carbonate minerals equilibrate with fluid $\delta$ 18O values at three orders of magnitude lower water:rock ratios ({\textless}10) than the water:rock ratios at which they equilibrate with fluid $\delta$13C values ( 103). 87Sr86Sr ratios are affected at variable rates. In order to reset the 87Sr86Sr value of a marine limestone during freshwater diagenesis, water:rock ratios similar to those calculated for equilibration of $\delta$13C values are required, while Sr-Ca-rich brines can reset the 87Sr86Sr value of a limestone at low water:rock ratios, similar to those calculated for equilibration of $\delta$18O values. Water:rock ratios exceeding 103 are required to affect the rare earth element (REE) patterns and Nd isotopic compositions of carbonate sediments during diagenesis. These large, relative differences in the response of different isotopic systems to water-rock interaction translate into characteristic trends on isotope and trace element covariation diagrams that can be used to distinguish between ( 1 ) different models for water-rock interaction and (2) different processes such as water-rock interaction, mixing of fluids, and mixing of mineral endmembers. An example is the use of simultaneous variations of O and Sr isotopes in modeling the freshwater diagenesis of limestones. Fresh-water-limestone interaction pathways are independent of Sr-Ca exchange distribution coefficient (KSr-CaD) values over an order of magnitude range of 0.01 to 0.15, because of the large differences in the water:rock ratios necessary to equilibrate the two isotopic systems. Carbon vs. oxygen isotopic variations in the same system can be used to distinguish between water-rock interaction, mixing of fluids, and mixing of end-member calcites. These modeling approaches are applied to the regionally extensive dolomites of the Mississippian Burlington-Keokuk Formation. Compared to its early dolomite precursor (dolomite I), second-generation replacement dolomite (II) in the Burlington-Keokuk Formation has higher 87Sr86Sr ratios, lower $\delta$18O values and Sr concentrations, and similar $\delta$13C values, Nd isotopic compositions, and REE patterns. A multistage model calculation can account for the dolomite II data via recrystallization of dolomite I, whereby the $\delta$18O values of dolomite II record a relatively minor and late portion of the water-rock interaction history of the samples while Sr in the dolomites preserves an earlier and larger segment of the same history. The recrystallization process was effected by extraformational brines in a relatively open system with respect to Sr, while C and the REE were unaffected.},

abstract = {Several Permian-Triassic boundary sections occur in various structural units within Hungary. These sections represent different facies zones of the western Palaeotethys margin. The G{\'{a}}rdony core in the NE part of the Transdanubian Range typically represents the inner ramp, while the B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny section in the B{\"{u}}kk Mountains of northern Hungary represents an outer ramp setting. The two sections have different patterns for their $\delta$13C values. The B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny section shows a continuous change towards more negative $\delta$13C values starting at the first biotic decline, followed by a sharp, quasi-symmetric negative peak at the second decline. The appearance of the $\delta$13C peak has no relationship to the lithology and occurs within a shale with low overall carbonate content, indicating that the peak is not related to diagenesis or other secondary influences. Instead, the shift and the peak reflect primary processes related to changes in environmental conditions. The continuous shift in $\delta$13C values is most probably related to a decrease in bioproductivity, whereas the sharp peak can be attributed to an addition of C strongly depleted in 13C to the ocean-atmosphere system. The most plausible model is a massive release of methane-hydrate. The quasi-symmetric pattern suggests a rapid warming-cooling cycle or physical unroofing of sediments through slope-failure and releasing methane-hydrate. The G{\'{a}}rdony-1 core shows a continuous negative $\delta$13C shift starting below the P-T boundary. However, the detailed analyses revealed a sharp $\delta$13C peak in the boundary interval, just below the major biotic decline, although its magnitude doesn't reach that observed in the B{\'{a}}lv{\'{a}}ny section. Based on careful textural examination and high-resolution stable isotope microanalyses we suggest that the suppression of the $\delta$13C peak that is common in the oolitic boundary sections is due to combined effects of condensed sedimentation, sediment reworking and erosion, as well as perhaps diagenesis. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Authigenic seafloor carbonate crusts include fenestrate microbialite, thrombolite, and four types here designated: Fine-grained Crust, Sparry Crust, Hybrid Sparry Fine-grained Crust, and Sparry Crust plus Coarse Grains. Each of the latter four types includes at least some layered examples that have generally been regarded as stromatolites. Recognition and interpretation of these various deposits assists understanding of stromatolite development. Sparry Crust is common in the Late Archaean-Mesoproterozoic. It includes botryoidal fans and other crystal pseudomorphs, microdigitate stromatolite, dendrite, isopachous laminite, and herringbone calcite. Although differing in primary mineralogy and bedform, these are all characterized by coarse sparry, commonly radial fi brous, fabric and appear light coloured in thin-section. They have commonly been referred to as seafl oor cement, although they formed at the open sediment-water interface rather than as void-fills. Two of them in particular, isopachous laminite and micro- digitate “tufa”, typically form isopachous layers with good vertical inheritance and have been regarded as stro- matolites. In contrast to Sparry Crust, Fine-grained Crust has fine-grained (micritic, clotted, peloidal, filamentous) microfabric that appears dark in thin-section, and irregular uneven layering with relatively poor inheritance. Mixed crusts, composed of millimetric alternations of Sparry and Fine-grained crust, are here termed Hybrid Sparry Fine- grained Crust. Sparry Crust with coarse allochthonous grains – here termed Sparry Crust plus Coarse Grains – includes some examples that have been given formal stromatolite names, e.g., Gongylina and Omachtenia. Sparry, Hybrid, and Fine-grained crusts are common components of Precambrian stromatolites. Their relative abun- dances change through time. Archaean stromatolite fabrics are commonly obscured by recrystallization, but their preserved lamina arrangements suggest that many of them could be composed mainly of Sparry or Hybrid crust. During the Palaeoproterozoic-Mesoproterozoic, Sparry Crust fabrics were common in peritidal stromatolites, where- as Hybrid Crust appears to have dominated large subtidal domes and columns. Fine-grained Crust may not have become generally abundant until the Neoproterozoic, when it commonly formed both stromatolites and throm bolites. Phanerozoic normal marine stromatolites are also typically composed of Fine-grained Crust. Present-day analogues of Sparry Crust fabrics occur in some speleothem, hot spring, and splash-zone marine crusts, and of Fine-grained Crust in lithif ed microbial mats. Light-dark millimetric alternations of sparry and fi ne-grained crust that characterize Hybrid Crust have analogues in freshwater stromatolites. Taken together, these com parisons suggest that some Precambrian stromatolites are abiogenic, some microbial, and others are intimate hybrid mixtures of the two, and that – preservation permitting – these varieties can be distinguished using microfabric and lamina criteria.},

We have determined the Re and Os abundances, and Os isotope compositions, of marine mudrock samples that span the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in the UK and have established that major isotopic and geochemical shifts in the composition of seawater took place in the latest Triassic. We argue that these shifts were caused by the sudden initiation of widespread igneous activity within the Central Atlantic magmatic province, associated with rifting of the supercontinent Pangea. The Os isotope composition of seawater responded rapidly to these events, demonstrating that the seawater Os isotope system has great potential in identifying the nature and precise timing of major environmental change.},

It receives ∼4 Mt yr-1particulate terrestrial organic carbon with initial particle Corgloading ∼0.7 mg m-2. Corgloading is reduced to ∼0.3 mg m-2in the topset-upper foreset zones of the delta despite additional inputs of mangrove and planktonic detritus, and high net sediment accumulation rates of 1-4 cm yr-1. Carbon isotopic analyses ($\delta$13C, $\Delta$14C) of $\Sigma$CO2and Corgdemonstrate rapid ({\textless}100 yr) remineralization of both terrestrial ($\delta$13C {\textless}-28.6) and marine Corg($\delta$13C ∼-20.5) ranging in average age from modern (bomb) ($\Delta$14C ∼60) to ∼1000 yr ($\Delta$14C ∼-140). Efficient and rapid remineralization in the topset-upper foreset zone is promoted by frequent physical reworking, bioturbation, exposure, and reoxidation of deposits. The seafloor in these regions, particularly {\textless}20 m, apparently functions as a periodically mixed, suboxic batch reactor dominated by microbial biomass. Although terrestrial sources can be the primary metabolic substrates at inshore sites, relatively young marine Corgoften preferentially dominates pore water $\Sigma$CO2relative to bulk Corgin the upper foreset. Thus a small quantity of young, rapidly recycled marine organic material is often superimposed on a generally older, less reactive terrestrial background. Whereas the pore water $\Sigma$CO2reflects both rapidly cycled marine and terrestrial sources, terrestrial material dominates the slower overall net loss of Corgfrom particles in the topset-upper foreset zone (i.e. recycled marine Corgleaves little residue). Preferential utilization of Corgsubpools and diagenetic fractionation of C isotopes supports the reactive continuum model as a conceptual basis for net decomposition kinetics. Early diagenetic fractionation of C isotopes relative to the bulk sedimentary Corgcomposition can produce changes in14C activity independent of radioactive decay. In the Gulf of Papua topset-upper foreset, $\Delta$14C of pore water $\Sigma$CO2averaged ∼ 300‰ greater than Corgsediment between ∼1-3 m depth in deposits. Diagenetic fractionation and decomposition aging of sedimentary Corgcompromises simple application of14C for determination of sediment accumulation rates in diagenetically reactive deposits. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Vertical and horizontal distributions of dissolved and suspended particulate Fe and Mn, and vertical fluxes of these metals (obtained with sediment traps) were determined throughout the Pacific Ocean. In general, dissolved Fe is low in surface and deep waters (0.1 to 0.7 nmol/kg), with maxima associated with the intermediate depth oxygen minimum zone (2.0 to 6.6 nmol/kg). Vertical distributions of dissolved Mn are similar to previous reports, exhibiting a surface maximum, a subsurface minimum, a Mn maximum layer coincident with the oxygen minimum zone, and lowest values in deep waters. Near-shore removal processes are more intense for dissolved Fe than for dissolved Mn. Dissolved Mn in the surface mixed layer remains elevated much farther offshore than dissolved Fe. Elevated near-surface dissolved Mn concentrations occur in the North Pacific Equatorial Current, suggesting transport from the eastern boundary. Near-surface mixed-layer dissolved Mn concentrations are higher in the North Pacific gyre reflecting enhanced northern hemisphere aeolian sources. Residence time estimates for the settling of refractory paniculate Fe and Mn from the upper water column are 62-220 days (Fe), and 105-235 days (Mn). In contrast, residence times for the scavenging of dissolved Fe and Mn are 2-13 years (Fe) and 3-74 years (Mn). Scavenging residence times for dissolved Mn based on horizontal mixing in the surface mixed layer of the northeast Pacific are 0.4 years (nearshore) to 19 years (1000 km offshore). There is no evidence for in situ Fe redox dissolution within sub-oxic waters in the eastern tropical North Pacific. Dissolved Fe appeared to be controlled by dissolution from sub-oxic sediments, with oxidative scavenging in the water column or upper sediment layers. However, in situ Mn dissolution within the oxygen minimum zone was evident. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {The Kara Sea is an area uniquely suitable for studying processes in the river–sea system. This is a shallow sea into which two great Siberian rivers, Yenisei and Ob, flow. From 1995 to 2003, the sea was studied by six international expeditions aboard the R/V Akademik Boris Petrov. This publication summarizes the results obtained, within the framework of this project, at the Vernadsky Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences. Various hydrogeochemical parameters, concentrations and isotopic composition of organic and carbonate carbon of the sediments, plankton, particulate organic matter, hydrocarbons, and dissolved CO2 were examined throughout the whole sea area at more than 200 sites. The $\delta$13C varies from –22 and 24‰ where Atlantic waters enter the Kara Sea and in the North-eastern part of the water area to –27‰ in the Yenisei and Ob estuaries. The value of $\delta$13C of the plankton is only weakly correlated with the $\delta$13C of the organic matter from the sediments and is lower by as much as 34‰. The paper presents the results obtained from a number of meridional river–sea profiles. It was determined from the relations between the isotopic compositions of plankton and particulate matter that the riverwaters carry material consisting of 70{\%} detrital–humus matter and 30{\%} planktonogenic material in the river part, and the material contained in the offshore waters consists of 30{\%} terrigenous components, with the contribution of bioproducers amounting to 70{\%}. The carbon isotopic composition of the plankton ranges from –29 to 35‰ in the riverine part, from –28 to 27‰ in the estuaries, and from –27.0 to –25{\%} in the marine part. The relative lightness of the carbon isotopic composition of plankton in Arctic waters is explained by the temperature effect, elevated CO2 concentrations, and long-distance CO2 supply to the sea with riverwaters. The data obtained on the isotopic composition of CO2 in the surface waters of the Kara Sea were used to map the distribution of $\delta$13CCO2 . The complex of hydrocarbon gases extracted from the waters included methane, C2C5, and unsaturated C2=C4= hydrocarbons, for which variations in the concentrations in the waters were studied along river–estuary–sea profiles. The geochemistry of hydrocarbon gases in surface fresh waters is characterized by comparable concentrations of methane (0.3–5 $\mu$l/l) and heavier hydrocarbons, including unsaturated ones. Microbiological methane with $\delta$13C from –105 to –90‰ first occurs in the sediments at depths of 40–200 cm. The sediments practically everywhere display traces of methane oxidation in the form of a shift of the $\delta$13C of methane toward higher values and the occurrence of autogenic carbonate material, including ikaite, enriched in the light isotope. Ikaite ($\delta$13C from –25 to 60‰) was found and examined in several profiles. The redox conditions in the sediments varied from normal in the southern part of the sea to highly oxidized along the Novaya Zemlya Trough. Vertical sections through the sediments of the latter exemplify the complete suppression of the biochemical activity of microorganisms. Our data provide insight into the biogeochemistry of the Kara Sea and make it possible to specify the background values needed for ecological control during the future exploration operations and extraction of hydrocarbons in the Kara Sea.},

abstract = {The aftermath of the great end-Permian period mass extinction 252 Myr ago shows how life can recover from the loss of {\textgreater}90{\%} species globally. The crisis was triggered by a number of physical environmental shocks (global warming, acid rain, ocean acidification and ocean anoxia), and some of these were repeated over the next 56 Myr. Ammonoids and some other groups diversified rapidly, within 13 Myr, but extinctions continued through the Early Triassic period. Triassic ecosystems were rebuilt stepwise from low to high trophic levels through the Early to Middle Triassic, and a stable, complex ecosystem did not re-emerge until the beginning of the Middle Triassic, 89 Myr after the crisis. A positive aspect of the recovery was the emergence of entirely new groups, such as marine reptiles and decapod crustaceans, as well as new tetrapods on land, including eventually dinosaurs. The stepwise recovery of life in the Triassic could have been delayed either by biotic drivers (complex multispecies interactions) or physical perturbations, or a combination of both. This is an example of the wider debate about the relative roles of intrinsic and extrinsic drivers of large-scale evolution.},

We propose that authigenic carbonate, produced in sediment pore fluids during early diagenesis, has played a major role in the carbon cycle in the past. This sink constitutes a minor component of the carbon isotope mass balance under the modern, high levels of atmospheric oxygen but was much larger in times of low atmospheric O(2) or widespread marine anoxia. Waxing and waning of a global authigenic carbonate sink helps to explain extreme carbon isotope variations in the Proterozoic, Paleozoic, and Triassic.},

abstract = {High-resolution carbon isotope records of organic carbon ([delta]13Corg) across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) from the expanded sections of the Tr{\o}ndelag and Finnmark platforms in Norway demonstrate that the negative carbon isotope excursion around the PTB begins with a stepwise 8[per mille sign] negative decline to a first minimum. After a subsequent positive excursion, a second minimum follows in the basal Griesbachian. Particulate organic matter (POM) is dominated by terrestrial particles with changing marine contributions. Intervals with minor C-isotope fluctuations coincide with homogeneous terrestrial POM assemblages, whereas intervals with pronounced C-isotope fluctuations correspond to heterogeneous marine-terrestrial POM assemblages, suggesting that the C-isotope curve represents a global signal with superimposed local variations of carbon sources. The [delta]13Corg of the contributing organic carbon ranges from - 32[per mille sign] (marine organic carbon) to - 22[per mille sign] (terrestrial organic carbon). Comparison of the new record, divided into 10 chemostratigraphic intervals with other, globally distributed sections suggests the presence of gaps in several classical PTB sections. Detailed chemostratigraphic correlation reveals that the extinction of marine organisms occurred during the stepwise negative shift and the end-Permian floral turnover occurred prior to the first C-isotope minimum. The correlation also shows that the marker of the recently defined Global Stratotype Section and Point PTB occurs within a broad interval ranging from most negative [delta]13C values up to the subsequent isotopic increase.},

A greater amount of aragonite precipitates when and where respiration, rather than photosynthesis, influences local DIC, which is consistent with sulfate reduction promoting carbonate precipitation and calcium release during decay of exopolymeric substances. Thus, heterotrophs play a more direct role than phototrophs in stromatolite lithification. Cyanobacteria are spatially associated with aragonite containing heterotrophic isotopic signatures. Hence, the absence of an autotrophic isotopic sigature in the rock record does not imply the absence of photosynthetic organisims. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2006 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Pelagic deposits at Abadeh represent a complete biostratigraphic record across the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB). The presumed water depth during deposition of these sediments was between 60 and 90 m. Similar to other Permian/Triassic boundary sections, the succession at Abadeh is characterised by a negative carbon isotope shift of approximately 4‰. The values start to decrease in the lower C. changxingensis - C. deflecta s.l. Zone, reach −0.12‰ (V-PDB) in the uppermost Permian just below the PTB, remain low to the early I. isarcica Zone (−0.32‰) and increase subsequently in the upper I. isarcica Zone. For the time interval of the PTB negative carbon isotope excursion, between the C. iranica and the I. isarcica Zones, no correlation exists between the $\delta$ 13C carb and the $\delta$ 18O carb. The above observations argue against the conclusion of Heydari et al. (2001) that the carbon isotope event at the P/T transition is an alteration artefact and not a global signal. The decrease in $\delta$ 13C carb is accompanied by a {\~{}}5‰ (and potentially up to 10‰) increase in $\delta$ 34S SSS. Together, these features are thought to reflect a complex global event, notably the development of widespread anoxic oceans with anoxic bottom layers rising onto the shelves. For the carbon isotope drop, other factors, such as the collapse of ocean primary productivity may also have played a role. The 87Sr/ 86Sr ratios of Dzhulfian seawater show only a minor increase from 0.70705 to 0.70710, reaching 0.70720 in the Dorashamian. The increase becomes steeper in the Early Triassic reaching 0.70754 in the N. dieneri Zone. The rise of the strontium isotope values is thought to be related to enhanced continental weathering under humid climatic conditions in the uppermost Permian ( C. meishanensis - H. praeparvusZone) and the lack of a dense land vegetation in the Early Triassic, prior to the Spathian (Upper Olenekian).},

For organisms exhibiting a vicariant biogeographic pattern-achieving their current distribution by riding on the plates of former supercontinents-this view is largely inspired by the belief that Pangaea lacked geographical or ecological barriers, or that extinctions and dispersal would have erased any biogeographic signal since the early Mesozoic. We here present a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny of Onychophora (velvet worms), an ancient and exclusively terrestrial panarthropod group distributed throughout former Pangaean landmasses. Our data not only demonstrate that trans-oceanic dispersal does not need be invoked to explain contemporary distributions, but also reveal that the early diversification of the group pre-dates the break-up of Pangaea, maintaining regionalization even in landmasses that have remained contiguous throughout the history of the group. These results corroborate a growing body of evidence from palaeontology, palaeogeography and palaeoclimatic modelling depicting ancient biogeographic regionalization over the continuous landmass of Pangaea.},

abstract = {Methane, a common trace constituent of groundwaters, occasionally makes up more than 20{\%} of the total carbon in groundwaters1,2. In aerobic environments CH4–rich waters can enable microbial food chain supporting a mixed culture of bacteria with methane oxidation as the primary energy source to develop3. Such processes may influence the isotopic composition of the residual methane and because 13C/12C analyses have been used to characterize the genesis of methanes found in different environments, an understanding of the magnitude of such effects is necessary. In addition, carbon dioxide produced by the methane-utilizing bacteria can be added to the inorganic carbon pool of affected groundwaters. We found carbon dioxide experimentally produced by methane-utilizing bacteria to be enriched in 12C by 5.0–29.6‰, relative to the residual methane. Where methane-bearing groundwaters discharged into aerobic environments microbial methane oxidation occurred, with the residual methane becoming progressively enriched in 13C. Various models have been proposed to explain the 13C/12C and 14C content of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) of groundwaters in terms of additions or losses during flow in the subsurface4,5. The knowledge of both stable carbon isotope ratios in various pools and the magnitude of carbon isotope fractionation during various processes allows geochemists to use the 13C/12C ratio of the DIC along with water chemistry to estimate corrected 14C groundwater ages4,5. We show here that a knowledge of the carbon isotope fractionation between CH4 and CO2 during microbial methane-utilization could modify such models for application to groundwaters affected by microbial methane oxidation.},

To sequester or take up these micronutrients, various microorganisms apparently release strong complexing agents and catalyze redox reactions that modify the bioavailability of trace metals and promote their rapid cycling in the upper water column. In turn, the low availability of some metals controls the rate of photosynthesis in parts of the oceans and the transformation and uptake of major nutrients such as nitrogen. The extremely low concentrations of several essential metals are both the cause and the result of ultraefficient uptake systems in the plankton and of widespread replacement of metals by one another for various biochemical functions.},

abstract = {Stellate crystals of ferroan dolomite in neritic siliciclastic and carbonate sedimentary rocks between Sturtian and Marinoan glaciations in the Mackenzie Mountains are interpreted as replaced glendonites. These pseudomorphs after ikaite indicate that shallow seawater at that time was near freezing. Stromatolites verify that paleoenvironments were in the photic zone and physical sedimentary structures such as hummocky cross-bedding confirm that the seafloor was repeatedly disturbed by storms. Glendonites within these low-latitude, continental shelf to coastal sedimentary deposits imply that global ocean water during much of Cryogenian time was likely very cold. Such an ocean would easily have cooled to yield widespread sea ice and, through positive feedback, growth of low-latitude continental glaciers. In this situation gas hydrates could have formed in shallow-water, cold shelf sediment, but would have been particularly sensitive to destabilization as a result of sea-level change. Co-occurrence of pisolites and glendonites in these rocks additionally implies that some ooids and pisoids might have been, unlike Phanerozoic equivalents, characteristic of cold-water sediments. {\textcopyright} 2005 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Cold seeps occur in geologically active and passive continental margins, where pore waters enriched in methane are forced upward through the sediments by pressure gradients. The advective supply of methane leads to dense microbial communities with high metabolic rates. Anaerobic methane oxidation presumably coupled to sulphate reduction facilitates formation of carbonates and, in many places, generates extremely high concentrations of hydrogen sulphide in pore waters. Increased food supply, availability of hard substratum and high concentrations of methane and sulphide supplied to free-living and symbiotic bacteria provide the basis for the complex ecosystems found at these sites. This review examines the structures of animal communities in seep sediments and how they are shaped by hydrologic, geochemical and microbial processes. The full size range of biota is addressed but emphasis is on the mid-size sediment-dwelling infauna (foraminiferans, metazoan meiofauna and macrofauna), which have received less attention than megafauna or microbes. Megafaunal biomass at seeps, which far exceeds that of surrounding non-seep sediments, is dominated by bivalves (mytilids, vesicomyids, lucinids and thyasirids) and vestimentiferan tube worms, with pogonophorans, cladorhizid sponges, gastropods and shrimp sometimes abundant. In contrast, seep sediments at shelf and upper slope depths have infaunal densities that often differ very little from those in ambient sediments. At greater depths, seep infauna exhibit enhanced densities, modified composition and reduced diversity relative to background sediments. Dorvilleid, hesionid and ampharetid polychaetes, nematodes, and calcareous foraminiferans are dominant. There is extensive spatial heterogeneity of microbes and higher organisms at seeps. Specialized infaunal communities are associated with different seep habitats (microbial mats, clam beds, mussel beds and tube worms aggregations) and with different vertical zones in the sediment. Whereas fluid flow and associated porewater properties, in particular sulphide concentration, appear to regulate the distribution, physiological adaptations and sometimes behaviour of many seep biota, sometimes the reverse is true. Animal-microbe interactions at seeps are complex and involve symbioses, heterotrophic nutrition, geochemical feedbacks and habitat structure. Nutrition of seep fauna varies, with thiotrophic and methanotrophic symbiotic bacteria fueling most of the megafaunal forms but macrofauna and most meiofauna are mainly heterotrophic. Macrofaunal food sources are largely photosynthesis-based at shallower seeps but reflect carbon fixation by chemosynthesis and considerable incorporation of methane-derived C at deeper seeps. Export of seep carbon appears to be highly localized based on limited studies in the Gulf of Mexico. Seep ecosystems remain one of the ocean's true frontiers. Seep sediments represent some of the most extreme marine conditions and offer unbounded opportunities for discovery in the realms LISA A.

abstract = {High survival and at least regional blooms of siliceous marine groups, with coeval retreat of calcareous organisms, is known from the Frasnian–Famennian (radiolarians, silicisponges) and end-Cretaceous (diatoms, radiolarians) mass extinctions. A strictly actualistic approach to the palaeoecology of silica-secreting biota is of limited significance, especially for silica-enriched and oligotrophic Palaeozoic epeiric seas and, in particular, during biotic turnovers. Adaptation among silica-secreting marine plankton has led toward more efficient utilization of shrinking dissolved silica resources within surface waters of Cenozoic oceans, as shown by both radiolarians and diatoms. This biosiliceous signal during the major biotic crises is mostly explained by a large-scale increase in volcano-hydrothermal activity during major plate-boundary re-arrangements, triggering global ecosystem perturbations. The cumulative stimulus favoured siliceous versus calcareous biota growth, deposition and preservation because of (1) a higher rate of input of silica and other nutrients, promoting eutrophication pulses, (2) a punctuated (or reversed) greenhouse climatic effect, episodically coupled with (3) vigorous oceanic circulation due to a variety of volcanogenic upwellings and turnovers. Siliceous communities, adapted to more eutrophic conditions, have thrived in the stressed niches. On the other hand, expanding anoxia and nutrification may lead to a stepwise loss of deep-water niches and consequent selective decline of more specialized oligotrophic radiolarians and other pelagic biota. By contrast, siliceous faunas experienced severe non-selective losses during the end-Permian mass extinction (recorded as a `chert gap'). Thus, the greatest environmental disaster of the Phanerozoic was driven by a unique set of killing factors, extremely effective for radiolarian productivity, e.g., due to the combination of a drastic volcanic winter with expanding superanoxia.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical cycles of H, C, N, O and S are coupled via biologically catalysed electron transfer (redox) reactions. The metabolic processes responsible for maintaining these cycles evolved over the first ca 2.3 Ga of Earth's history in prokaryotes and, through a sequence of events, led to the production of oxygen via the photobiologically catalysed oxidation of water. However, geochemical evidence suggests that there was a delay of several hundred million years before oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere related to changes in the burial efficiency of organic matter and fundamental alterations in the nitrogen cycle. In the latter case, the presence of free molecular oxygen allowed ammonium to be oxidized to nitrate and subsequently denitrified. The interaction between the oxygen and nitrogen cycles in particular led to a negative feedback, in which increased production of oxygen led to decreased fixed inorganic nitrogen in the oceans. This feedback, which is supported by isotopic analyses of fixed nitrogen in sedimentary rocks from the Late Archaean, continues to the present. However, once sufficient oxygen accumulated in Earth's atmosphere to allow nitrification to out-compete denitrification, a new stable electron 'market' emerged in which oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration ultimately spread via endosymbiotic events and massive lateral gene transfer to eukaryotic host cells, allowing the evolution of complex (i.e. animal) life forms. The resulting network of electron transfers led a gas composition of Earth's atmosphere that is far from thermodynamic equilibrium (i.e. it is an emergent property), yet is relatively stable on geological time scales. The early coevolution of the C, N and O cycles, and the resulting non-equilibrium gaseous by-products can be used as a guide to search for the presence of life on terrestrial planets outside of our Solar System.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}There is evidence of ice melt, sea level rise to +5–9 m, and extreme storms in the prior interglacial period that was less than 1 °C warmer than today. Human-made climate forcing is stronger and more rapid than paleo forcings, but much can be learned by combining insights from paleoclimate, climate modeling, and on-going observations. We argue that ice sheets in contact with the ocean are vulnerable to non-linear disintegration in response to ocean warming, and we posit that ice sheet mass loss can be approximated by a doubling time up to sea level rise of at least several meters. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield sea level rise of several meters in 50, 100 or 200 years. Paleoclimate data reveal that subsurface ocean warming causes ice shelf melt and ice sheet discharge. Our climate model exposes amplifying feedbacks in the Southern Ocean that slow Antarctic bottom water formation and increase ocean temperature near ice shelf grounding lines, while cooling the surface ocean and increasing sea ice cover and water column stability. Ocean surface cooling, in the North Atlantic as well as the Southern Ocean, increases tropospheric horizontal temperature gradients, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, which drive more powerful storms. We focus attention on the Southern Ocean's role in affecting atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} amount, which in turn is a tight control knob on global climate. The millennial (500–2000 year) time scale of deep ocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} change, thus the time scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet and sea level changes. This millennial carbon cycle time scale should not be misinterpreted as the ice sheet time scale for response to a rapid human-made climate forcing. Recent ice sheet melt rates have a doubling time near the lower end of the 10–40 year range. We conclude that 2 °C global warming above the preindustrial level, which would spur more ice shelf melt, is highly dangerous. Earth's energy imbalance, which must be eliminated to stabilize climate, provides a crucial metric.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Morphological, chemical, isotopic and textural studies of pyritiferous carbonate concretions from the Jet Rock (Lower Jurassic, England) are all consistent in indicating an origin by anaerobic methane oxidation. Concretionary growth occurred in a stratigraphically thin, sub-surface zone of uncompacted sediment, where methane (diffusing from below) was consumed to stimulate a late phase of locally intense sulphate reduction, which caused the precipitation of CaCO3 and isotopically heavy FeS2. The carbon isotope composition of the concretionary carbonate was indistinguishable from that of sulphate reduction (using sedimentary organic matter), due to the simultaneous diffusion of isotopically light CH4 and isotopically heavy dissolved carbonate from the underlying methanogenic zone. The alkalinity generated by anaerobic methane oxidation resulted in precipitation being restricted to a thin, vertically confined zone beneath the sediment/water interface. A pause in deposition then allowed continued precipitation in the form of concretionary growth. Different stages in the evolution of isolated concretions into nodular limestones depend on the magnitude of carbonate supersaturation in the zone of anaerobic methane oxidation and the duration of the pause in sedimentation. Vertically confined zones of carbonate precipitation may also be developed deeper in the sediment due to iron reduction, a further pause in deposition can then produce isotopically heavy carbonate concretions in the zone of methanogenesis.},

abstract = {Geographic range is of crucial importance concerning the extinction risk of species. However, our understanding of how the influence of this trait on extinction risk has varied through Earth history and across different climate regimes is still rather unexplored. This is especially true for taxa that are currently of strong interest in conservation biology, displaying a strong mismatch between paleontological studies and modern efforts to quantify the extinction risk of threatened species. We herein calculated a continuous measure for the connection of geographic range and extinction risk in the deep-time amphibian fossil record. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of climate on this connection, using two climate proxies derived from oxygen isotope data (global relative temperature change and variations in the latitudinal temperature gradient). We show that geographic ranges tended to be larger during times of comparatively small latitudinal temperature gradients. Moreover, the strength of geographic range influencing extinction risk fluctuated temporally, but remained positive at all times. The variation in range size impact on extinction risk showed a strong connection with the latitudinal temperature gradient. Our findings indicate that geographic range persists as a factor influencing species' extinction risk through all times. However, geographic range seemed less important during times of higher environmental variability. Reasons might be the restriction of species ranges due to environmental constraints, causing ranges to become more similar and therefore lose relative importance in buffering for extinction risk, while other factors gain in importance. Simultaneously, similar ranges might be more prone to alteration by e.g. conservation biases (related to sedimentary deposition and fossilization) in relation to their real range size, resulting in a smaller signal-to-noise ratio, potentially affecting the correlation strength. We show that trait-extinction risk dynamics can vary in their intensity, and that specifically the observed impact of geographic range on extinction risk can vary with climatic changes.},

Also presented here is a method for estimating the magnitude of the Signor–Lipps effect, which is the incorrect assignment of extinctions that occurred during a crisis to an interval preceding the crisis because of the incompleteness of the fossil record. Estimates for the magnitudes of mass extinctions presented here are in most cases lower than those previously published. They indicate that only ∼81{\%} of marine species died out in the great terminal Permian crisis, whereas levels of 90–96{\%} have frequently been quoted in the literature. Calculations of the latter numbers were incorrectly based on combined data for the Middle and Late Permian mass extinctions. About 90 orders and more than 220 families of marine animals survived the terminal Permian crisis, and they embodied an enormous amount of morphological, physiological, and ecological diversity. Life did not nearly disappear at the end of the Permian, as has often been claimed.},

Three properties of tropical dynamics are prominent in paleoclimate: the sensitivity of the tropical climate to change; the ability of the tropical climate to reorganize; and the ability of the tropical climate to project its influence globally. The El Ni{\~{A}}±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) system exemplifies these properties, making ENSO particularly prominent in paleoclimate.

Six potentially useful patterns emerge when viewing stable isotope data within a stratigraphic framework. Analysis of samples from five Palaeozoic and Mesozoic formations, which contained petrographic evidence of early freshwater diagenesis, showed that isotope patterns similar to those observed in Barbados limestones have been preserved in rocks as old as Mississippian. These isotope patterns could prove useful for identifying diagenetically induced porosity trends in carbonate rocks: to identify limestones diagenetically altered in meteoric environments, to identify mixing zone cements and dolomites, and to trace the regional and vertical distributions of early meteoric groundwater systems in ancient carbonate formations.-from AuthorsDept of Geol Sci, Brown Univ, Providence, Rhode Island 02912, USA.},

abstract = {The common phosphate minerals, apatite Ca5(PO4)3(F,OH,Cl), monazite (Ce,La,Th)PO4, and xenotime YPO4, have found widespread use in geochronology because they incorporate U and Th into their structures. For example, apatite usually has a few tens of ppm of both U and Th, while monazite and xenotime usually have hundreds of ppm to weight percent levels of these elements. As a consequence, these phosphates can be dated using several fundamentally different isotopic techniques. Elsewhere in this volume Harrison et al. describe phosphate dating using ingrowth of radiogenic Pb, the final daughter of U and Th series decay, and Gleadow et al. describe dating based on damage tracks from the spontaneous fission of 238U. The most recently developed dating technique applied to phosphates, described in this chapter, uses the accumulation of $\alpha$ particles from U and Th series decay, (U-Th)/He dating. While phosphate U-Th-Pb dating is usually used to date high temperature events such as crystallization of igneous rocks and the timing of prograde metamorphism, fission track and (U-Th)/He dating are more commonly used to establish cooling histories through low temperatures, for example, in the range {\~{}}110-40°C in the case of apatite. Dating of minerals using radiogenic He was first explored shortly after the discovery of radioactivity (Strutt 1908) and was investigated extensively in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly on very U- and Th-rich minerals such as zircon and titanite (Hurley 1952, 1954; Damon and Kulp 1957, Damon and Green 1963). Apatite He dating was first investigated by Zeitler et al. (1987), who studied the diffusion rate of He from apatite and proposed that apatite He dating might provide a useful thermochronometer, recording cooling through about 100°C. Further studies both in the laboratory (Lippolt et al. 1994, Wolf et al. 1996b, Warnock et al. 1997, Farley 2000) and in the natural setting (House et al. 1999, Stockli et al. 2000) have confirmed this idea, and the technique has now been applied to a range of tectonic, geologic and geomorphologic problems (e.g., House et al. 1997, 1998; Spotila et al. 1997, Farley et al. 2001, Stockli et al. 2000). Monazite and xenotime have only recently come under scrutiny for He geochronology (e.g., Pik and Marty 1999), and little is yet known of their potential for routine geo- or thermochronometry.

abstract = {The D/H ratio imaging of weakly hydrated minerals prepared as focused ion beam (FIB) sections is developed in order to combine isotopic imaging by nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS) of micrometer-sized grains with other nanoscale imaging techniques, such as transmission electron microscopy. In order to maximize the accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and reproducibility of D/H ratios at the micrometer size, while minimizing the surface contamination at the same time, we explored all instrumental parameters known to influence the measurement of D/H ratios in situ. Optimal conditions were found to be obtained with the use of (i) a Cs+ ion source and detection of H- and D- at low mass resolving power, (ii) a primary beam intensity of 100 pA, and (iii) raster sizes in the range of 8-15 $\mu$m. Nominally anhydrous minerals were used to evaluate the detection limits and indicate a surface contamination level of ∼200 ppm equivalent H2O under these conditions. With the high primary intensity used here, the dwell time is not a parameter as critical as found in previous studies and a dwell time of 1 ms/px is used to minimize dynamic contamination during analysis. Analysis of FIB sections was found to reduce significantly static contamination due to sample preparation and improved accuracy compared to using polished sections embedded not only in epoxy but in indium as well. On amphiboles, the typical overall uncertainty including reproducibility is ∼20 ‰ on bulk FIB sections and ∼50 ‰ at the 1.5 $\mu$m scale using image processing (1$\sigma$).},

Recent studies indicate that rapidly rising greenhouse gas concentrations are driving ocean systems toward conditions not seen for millions of years, with an associated risk of fundamental and irreversible ecological transformation. The impacts of anthropogenic climate change so far include decreased ocean productivity, altered food web dynamics, reduced abundance of habitat-forming species, shifting species distributions, and a greater incidence of disease. Although there is considerable uncertainty about the spatial and temporal details, climate change is clearly and fundamentally altering ocean ecosystems. Further change will continue to create enormous challenges and costs for societies worldwide, particularly those in developing countries.},

abstract = {A reservoir model of a Recent steady-state sedimentary system in which the reduced sulfur and oxidized sulfur reservoirs were coupled with the oxidized carbon and reduced carbon reservoirs was constructed. The time curve of the sulfur isotope ratios of the sedimentary sulfate reservoir was used to drive the model back to the beginning of Cambrian time (600 million years ago), producing the reservoir sizes and isotope values and material fluxes of the carbon-sulfur system. The predicted values of carbon isotope ratios of the carbonate reservoir agree well with observed values, showing that the model is basically sound. Some general conclusions from this success are (i) material flux rates in the carbon-oxygen-sulfur system of the geologic past (averaged over tens of millions of years) lie within about a factor of 2 of Recent rates. (ii) The oxidation-reduction balances of Phanerozoic time were dominated by reciprocal relationships between carbon and sulfur compounds. (iii) The rate of production of atmospheric oxygen by storage in sediments of organic carbon of photosynthetic origin increased from the Cambrian Period to the Permian Period and declined somewhat from the Permian Period to the Present. (iv) The storage of oxygen in oxidized sulfur compounds kept pace (within the limits of the data) with oxygen production. (v) Transfer of oxygen from CO(2) to SO(4) from the Cambrian to the Permian Period was several times the Recent free oxygen content of the atmosphere.},

Photosynthetic organisms utilize dissolved phosphorus, carbon, and other essential nutrients to build their tissues using energy from the sun. Biological productivity is contingent upon the availability of phosphorus to these simple organisms that constitute the base of the food web in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. It begins with a brief overview of the various components of the global phosphorus cycle. Estimates of the mass of important phosphorus reservoirs, transport rates (fluxes) between reservoirs. Following the overview, various aspects of the global phosphorus cycle are examined in more depth, including a discussion of the most pressing research questions currently being posed and research efforts presently underway to address these questions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The continuity through the past 300 million years of key tropical sediment types, namely coals, evaporites, reefs and carbonates, is examined. Physical controls for their geographical distributions are related to the Hadley cell circulation, and its effects on rainfall and ocean circulation. Climate modelling studies are reviewed in this context, as are biogeographical studies of key fossil groups. Low-latitude peats and coals represent everwet climates related to the Intertropical Convergence Zone near the Equator, as well as coastal diurnal rainfall systems elsewhere in the tropics and subtropics. The incidence of tropical coals and rainforests through time is variable, being least common during the interval of Pangean monsoonal climates. Evaporites represent the descending limbs of the Hadley cells and are centred at 10° to 40° north and south in latitudes that today show an excess of evaporation over precipitation. These deposits coincide with the deserts as well as seasonally rainy climates, and their latitudinal ranges seem to have been relatively constant through time. Reefs also can be related to the Hadley circulation. They thrive within the regions of clear water associated with broad areas of downwelling which are displaced toward the western portions of tropical oceans. These dynamic features are ultimately driven by the subtropical high-pressure cells which are the surface signature of the subsiding branches of the Hadley circulation. Carbonates occupy the same areas, but extend into higher latitudes in regions where terrestrial surface gradients are low and clastic runoff from the land is minimal. We argue that the palaeo-latitudinal record of all these climate-sensitive sediment types is broadly similar to their environments and latitudes of formation today, implying that dynamic effects of atmospheric and oceanic circulation control their distribution, rather than temperature gradients that would expand or contract through time.},

abstract = {Data have been obtained, from our own chemical analyses and from the literature, for the concentrations of organic carbon (C) and pyrite sulfur (S) in over 600 samples of Cambrian to recent normal marine shales. (Normal marine refers to deposition in oxygenated bottom water as evidenced by the presence of benthic fossils and/or indicators of bioturbation). All samples were selected to minimize 1. (1) loss of C and/or S due to weathering at the outcrop (by emphasizing the use of drill core material) 2. (2) analytical errors and non-diagenetic effects (by avoiding sediments low in C or S content such as sandstones) 3. (3) Fe limitation of pyrite formation (by avoiding limestones, cherts, and euxinic shales) 4. (4) metamorphic loss of C, relative to S (by avoiding rocks obviously subjected to, even low-grade, metamorphism). Our results indicate that (1) there is generally a good positive linear correlation between organic C and pyrite S for normal marine shales of all ages and (2) the mean C S ratio for normal marine shales has varied over time. Devonian to Tertiary shales exhibit mean C S weight ratios (1.8 ?? 0.5) somewhat lower than Quaternary sediments (mean C S = 2.8). This we believe is due to preferential C loss (relative to S) during biogenic methanogenesis plus diagenetic heating. Distinctly lower mean C/S values for the Cambrian and Ordovician (0.5 ?? 0.1) cannot be explained solely in terms of diagenetic C loss and, instead, must represent low original ratios. The low original ratios, we suggest, were due mainly to the absence of bacterially refractory organic matter added to the marine environment by rivers at that time, because the major source of such material, vascular land plants, had not yet evolved. This, along with a possibly lower degree of bioturbation, contributed to enhanced pyrite formation and preservation and, thus, lower early Paleozoic C S ratios. ?? 1986.},

abstract = {A three-phase kinetic model with time-specific perturbations is used to describe large-scale patterns in the diversification of Phanerozoic marine families. The basic model assumes that the Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern evolutionary faunas each diversified logistically as a consequence of early exponential growth and of later slowing of growth as the ecosystems became filled; it also assumes interaction among the evolutionary faunas such that expansion of the combined diversities of all three faunas above any single fauna's equilibrium caused that fauna's diversity to begin to decline. This basic model adequately describes the diversification of the evolutionary faunas through the Paleozoic Era as well as the asymmetrical rise and fall of background extinction rates through the entire Phanerozoic. Declines in diversity and changes in faunal dominance associated with mass extinctions can be accommodated in the model with short-term accelerations in extinction rates or declines in equilibria. Such accelerations, or perturbations, cause diversity to decline exponentially and then to rebound sigmoidally following release. The amount of decline is dependent on the magnitude and duration of the perturbation, the timing of the perturbation with respect to the diversification of the system, and the system's initial per-taxon rates of diversification and turnover. When applied to the three-phase model, such perturbations describe the changes in diversity and faunal dominance during and after major mass extinctions, the long-term rise in total diversity following the Late Permian and Norian mass extinctions, and the peculiar diversification and then decline of the remnants of the Paleozoic fauna during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Eras. The good fit of this model to data on Phanerozoic familial diversity suggests that many of the large-scale patterns of diversification seen in the marine fossil record of animal families are simple consequences of nonlinear interrelationships among a small number of parameters that are intrinsic to the evolutionary faunas and are largely (but not completely) invariant through time.

The classical oxygen isotope paleothermometry on fossil shells, while very proficient when applied to the younger (Cenozoic) portion of the geologic record, is believed to yield only unreliable results for the Phanerozoic "deep time", either because the empirically well documented secular trend to more negative ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O values with increasing age was generated by post-depositional recrystallization processes or, if primary, implies ecologically unpalatable hot early oceans. Here we present a compilation of ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O measurements for 58,532 low-Mg calcite marine shells that cover almost the entire Phanerozoic eon, argue that the secular decline of about -6??? is primary, propose that it reflects the changing oxygen isotopic composition of sea water, and define a new baseline trend for ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}O of paleo-sea water; the latter providing a new template for calculation of ambient habitat temperatures of fossil specimens. The resulting pattern for fossil taxa (foraminifera, brachiopods, belemnites and bivalves) mimics their modern counterparts in temperature ranges and modes. This conceptual framework enables application of actualistic concepts to ambient habitat temperatures of fossils and provides us with a long overdue tool for interpretation of "deep time" geologic history.},

In the 1930s and 1940s, many factors caused its general abandonment. Mobilism was revived in the 1950s and 1960s by measurements of long-term displacement of crustal blocks relative to each other (tectonic displacement) and to Earth's geographic pole (latitudinal displacement). Also, short-term or current displacements can now be measured. I briefly outline the categories of tectonic and current displacement and focus on latitudinal displacement. Integration of tectonic and latitudinal displacement in the early 1970s completed the new mobilistic paleogeography, in which the transformation of rock magnetization directions into paleopoles and latitudes and the finite rotation of spherical plates about pivot points play complementary roles; this new synthesis now provides a quantitative basis for studying long-term evolution of Earth's surface features and climate, the changing environments in which life evolves.},

abstract = {The transition between the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eons, beginning 542 million years (Myr) ago, is distinguished by the diversification of multicellular animals and by their acquisition of mineralized skeletons during the Cambrian period. Considerable progress has been made in documenting and more precisely correlating biotic patterns in the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian fossil record with geochemical and physical environmental perturbations, but the mechanisms responsible for those perturbations remain uncertain. Here we use new stratigraphic and geochemical data to show that early Palaeozoic marine sediments deposited approximately 540-480 Myr ago record both an expansion in the area of shallow epicontinental seas and anomalous patterns of chemical sedimentation that are indicative of increased oceanic alkalinity and enhanced chemical weathering of continental crust. These geochemical conditions were caused by a protracted period of widespread continental denudation during the Neoproterozoic followed by extensive physical reworking of soil, regolith and basement rock during the first continental-scale marine transgression of the Phanerozoic. The resultant globally occurring stratigraphic surface, which in most regions separates continental crystalline basement rock from much younger Cambrian shallow marine sedimentary deposits, is known as the Great Unconformity. Although Darwin and others have interpreted this widespread hiatus in sedimentation on the continents as a failure of the geologic record, this palaeogeomorphic surface represents a unique physical environmental boundary condition that affected seawater chemistry during a time of profound expansion of shallow marine habitats. Thus, the formation of the Great Unconformity may have been an environmental trigger for the evolution of biomineralization and the 'Cambrian explosion' of ecologic and taxonomic diversity following the Neoproterozoic emergence of animals.},

abstract = {The majority of carbon sequestration at the Earth's surface occurs in marine continental margin settings within fine-grained sediments whose mineral properties are a function of continental climatic conditions. We report very high mineral surface area (MSA) values of 300 and 570 m2 g in Late Cretaceous black shales from Ocean Drilling Program site 959 of the Deep Ivorian Basin that vary on subcentennial time scales corresponding with abrupt increases from approximately 3 to approximately 18{\%} total organic carbon (TOC). The observed MSA changes with TOC across multiple scales of variability and on a sample-by-sample basis (centimeter scale), provides a rigorous test of a hypothesized influence on organic carbon burial by detrital clay mineral controlled MSA. Changes in TOC also correspond with geochemical and sedimentological evidence for water column anoxia. Bioturbated intervals show a lower organic carbon loading on mineral surface area of 0.1 mg-OCm-2 when compared to 0.4 mg-OCm-2 for laminated and sulfidic sediments. Although either anoxia or mineral surface protection may be capable of producing TOC of {\textless}5{\%}, when brought together they produced the very high TOC (10-18{\%}) apparent in these sediments. This nonlinear response in carbon burial resulted from minor precession-driven changes of continental climate influencing clay mineral properties and runoff from the African continent. This study identifies a previously unrecognized land-sea connection among continental weathering, clay mineral production, and anoxia and a nonlinear effect on marine carbon sequestration during the Coniacian-Santonian Oceanic Anoxic Event 3 in the tropical eastern Atlantic.},

abstract = {Wide geographic range is generally thought to buffer taxa against extinction, but the strength of this effect has not been investigated for the great majority of the fossil record. Although the majority of genus extinctions have occurred between major mass extinctions, little is known about extinction selectivity regimes during these "background" intervals. Consequently, the question of whether selectivity regimes differ between background and mass extinctions is largely unresolved. Using logistic regression, we evaluated the selectivity of genus survivorship with respect to geographic range by using a global database of fossil benthic marine invertebrates spanning the Cambrian through the Neogene periods, an interval of approximately 500 My. Our results show that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship for the great majority of Phanerozoic time. Moreover, the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera. However, mass extinctions and several second-order extinction events exhibit less geographic range selectivity than predicted by range alone. Widespread environmental disturbance can explain the reduced association between geographic range and extinction risk by simultaneously affecting genera with similar ecological and physiological characteristics on global scales. Although factors other than geographic range have certainly affected extinction risk during many intervals, geographic range is likely the most consistently significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record.},

abstract = {A new Early Triassic marine fauna is described from the Central Oman Mountains. The fauna is Griesbachian in age, on the basis of abundant conodonts and ammonoids, and was deposited in an oxygenated seamount setting off the Arabian platform margin. It is the first Griesbachian assemblage from a well-oxygenated marine setting and thus provides a test for the hypothesis that widespread anoxia prevented rapid recovery. The earliest Griesbachian (parvus zone) contains a low-diversity benthic fauna dominated by the bivalves Promyalina and Claraia. A similar level of recovery characterizes the immediate postextinction interval worldwide. However, the middle upper Griesbachian sedimentary rocks (isarcica and carinata zones) contain an incredibly diverse benthic fauna of bivalves, gastropods, articulate brachiopods, a new undescribed crinoid, echinoids, and ostracods. This fauna is more diverse and ecologically complex than the typical middle to late Griesbachian faunas described from oxygen-restricted settings worldwide. The level of postextinction recovery observed in the Oman fauna is not recorded elsewhere until the Spathian. These data support the hypothesis that the apparent delay in recovery after the end-Permian extinction event was due to widespread and prolonged benthic oxygen restriction: in the absence of anoxia, marine recovery is much faster.},

abstract = {A synthesis of backscatter imagery coupled with a large 3D seismic dataset in the Lower Congo Basin (LCB) reveals a patchy distribution of features interpreted to be associated with fluid seepage from 300 m to 2500 m water depth. With the exception of one region of anomalous backscatter positive-relief mounds, all inferred seep sites occur in negative-relief pockmarks. The extensive 3D seismic dataset in the LCB offers a unique opportunity to study the plumbing system that is feeding surface cold seep systems, and in general, to reconstruct the relationship between tectonics and fluid flow in continental margins. The fluid seeps in the LCB are associated with morphologically, stratigraphically or tectonically controlled focused fluid flow. The integration of the geophysical datasets, backscatter imagery coupled to 3D seismic, clearly indicates that fluid seeps are not randomly distributed, but their seabed organization reflects 1) the location of the underlying structure (reservoir or trap) where the fluids are coming from, 2) the geometry and morphology of the reservoir/trap, and 3) the discontinuities in the sedimentary column along which fluids have migrated. In the LCB seafloor pockmarks are always associated with underlying tectonic structures (fault zones, salt diapirs, polygonal faults) or buried sedimentary bodies (turbiditic channels, erosional surfaces), whereas they never occur above sub-horizontal parallel-stratified fine-grained sediments. Even if triggering processes can not be clearly defined here, we propose a model of seafloor fluid seep organization, which represents a new tool for identifying the geometry of flow pathways and the underlying buried bodies where the fluids are originating from. This qualitative 3D model provides insight into the geohydrologic processes of continental margins. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We have constrained the environment of their formation from the standpoint of depositional and diagenetic conditions inferred on the basis of petrographic and geochemical data derived from examples in the Helena Formation, a calcareous marine interval within the Mesoproterozoic Belt Supergroup. The collective data set supports an early-diagenetic origin for molar-tooth structures and implies environmental factors that promoted rapid precipitation of calcite into CO2-generated voids in cohesive muds. We propose that the temporally restricted distribution of molar-tooth structures in the geologic record reflects a unique combination of the environmental parameters that control their formation. Of these factors, the most fundamental include CaCO3 saturation and redox conditions in shallow marine waters that promote prolific carbonate production, tectonic quiescence and the availability of extensive epicratonic sites for carbonate accumulation, and the absence of bioturbators.},

This excursion records a major climate-induced perturbation of the global carbon system. The delta C-13 excursion is accompanied by enrichments in manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe). The correlation of the delta C-13 excursion with trends in Mn and Fe contents reflects changes in Valanginian paleoceanography and climate. Fe enrichment occurs mainly in terrestrial, platform, and shelf regions. In a basinal direction the Fe content decreases, whereas the Mn/Fe ratio increases. An increase in sedimentary Mn and Fe concentrations is related to elevated continental weathering rates and to widespread dys- or anoxia that favored metal deposition in Valanginian sediments. Various oceanographic changes (e.g., expansion of oxygen-minimum zones) resulting from increased continental runoff led to a strong remobilization and focused reprecipitation of metals in the oceans of the Valanginian stage.},

The absence of predicted geochemical variations indicates that magnetite and phyllosilicates formed by diagenesis under low-temperature, circumneutral pH, rock-dominated aqueous conditions. Analyses of diagenetic features (including concretions, raised ridges, and fractures) at high spatial resolution indicate that they are composed of iron- and halogen-rich components, magnesium-iron-chlorine-rich components, and hydrated calcium sulfates, respectively. Composition of a cross-cutting dike-like feature is consistent with sedimentary intrusion.

abstract = {Glass ramps are coastal marine sedimentation regimes of siliceous biomineralization, and present alternatives to carbonate or siliciclastic deposition. Prominent chert deposits around the world record glass ramps from the Eocene, Jurassic, Permian, and Mississippian. These events ranged from regional to continental scale, and lasted from a couple million years to over ten million years. This review compares established cases of glass ramp deposition to clarify the bio-depositional features that distinguish glass ramps from other bedded or mounded biosiliceous deposits, and from carbonate ramp regimes. It also compares environmental contexts of glass ramp initiation and persistence. The primary sediment on these glass ramps is disaggregated spicules of siliceous sponges. The sponges formed meadows on level-bottom inner- and mid-ramp settings, and loose spicules were redistributed along the shelf. Carbonate bioclasts were generally present but diluted by the great abundance of spicules. Carbonate factories were either limited to small, dense patches; moved offshore; or re-established at a later time. Glass ramps initiated in a wide variety of climates and oceanographic settings but appeared to initially require partial protection from storm energy. The importance of marine silicic acid for such widespread biosiliceous factories is also estimated, showing that glass ramps required long-term adjustments in silica supply. Glass ramps lack modern analogues, but their ecology can be interpreted in light of stable state dynamics in other modern invertebrate communities. It is suggested that siliceous sponge meadows were an alternate stable state locally on carbonate ramps, occurring with greater frequency and carrying greater ecological significance than have been previously expected. This model warrants additional scrutiny on sponge meadows' possible stabilizing feedbacks and on the thresholds of state switching.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Raman spectroscopy uses the inelastic scattering of electromagnetic radiation by molecules. Monochromatic light of a laser interacts with phonons, the vibrational modes in the crystal lattice. The energy of the scattered light is shifted by the scattering. The shifts in energy yield the Raman spectrum that is specific for each mineral because the phonons are specific for each mineral. In this study, Raman spectroscopy of synthetic and natural iron (oxy)hydroxides and iron oxides was performed to test its potential in environmental magnetic studies and soil science. The main aim was to distinguish between the different iron oxides occurring in soils. Most of them can be identified by magnetic methods, but there are some minerals that are not easy to differentiate from each other. In these cases, the magnetic methods can be complemented by Raman spectroscopy. A major challenge is the fast transformation of many iron minerals if laser power is applied, especially if the material is poorly crystallized as often is the case in environmental material. In this study, very low laser powers were applied. Nevertheless, the investigated iron minerals could be distinguished from each other. Thus, a magnetic method to discern lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite in soil samples could be corroborated. It is also shown that Raman spectroscopy is an easy method to distinguish magnetite and maghemite. Due to the low laser powers applied, a wuestite band at about 595 cm1 could be established enabling a non-ambiguous identification of this mineral by its Raman spectrum. Furthermore, the potential of the method to investigate magnetic material produced by soil bacteria is demonstrated.},

abstract = {We present a revised approach for standardizing and reporting analyses of multiply substituted isotopologues of CO2 (i.e., ‘clumped' isotopic species, especially the mass-47 isotopologues). Our approach standardizes such data to an absolute reference frame based on theoretical predictions of the abundances of multiply-substituted isotopologues in gaseous CO2 at thermodynamic equilibrium. This reference frame is preferred over an inter-laboratory calibration of carbonates because it enables all laboratories measuring mass 47 CO2 to use a common scale that is tied directly to theoretical predictions of clumping in CO2, regardless of the laboratory's primary research field (carbonate thermometry or CO2 biogeochemistry); it explicitly accounts for mass spectrometric artifacts rather than convolving (and potentially confusing) them with chemical fractionations associated with sample preparation; and it is based on a thermodynamic equilibrium that can be experimentally established in any suitably equipped laboratory using commonly available materials. By analyzing CO2 gases that have been subjected to established laboratory procedures known to promote isotopic equilibrium (i.e., heated gases and water-equilibrated CO2), and by reference to thermodynamic predictions of equilibrium isotopic distributions, it is possible to construct an empirical transfer function that is applicable to data with unknown clumped isotope signatures. This transfer function empirically accounts for the fragmentation and recombination reactions that occur in electron impact ionization sources and other mass spectrometric artifacts. We describe the protocol necessary to construct such a reference frame, the method for converting gases with unknown clumped isotope compositions to this reference frame, and suggest a protocol for ensuring that all reported isotopic compositions (e.g., $\Delta$47 values; Eiler and Schauble, 2004 and Eiler, 2007) can be compared among different laboratories and instruments, independent of laboratory-specific analytical or methodological differences. We then discuss the use of intra-laboratory secondary reference frames (e.g., based on carbonate standards) that can be more easily used to track the evolution of each laboratory's empirical transfer function. Finally, we show inter-laboratory reproducibility on the order of ±0.010 (1$\sigma$) for four carbonate standards, and present revised paleotemperature scales that should be used to convert carbonate clumped isotope signatures to temperature when using the absolute reference frame described here. Even when using the reference frame, small discrepancies remain between two previously published synthetic carbonate calibrations. We discuss possible reasons for these discrepancies, and highlight the need for additional low temperature ({\textless}15 °C) synthetic carbonate experiments.},

Three main criteria suggest that acidification may$\backslash$nhave occurred across the T-J transition. 1) The eruption of the Central$\backslash$nAtlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the associated massive and$\backslash$nrapid release of CO2 coincident with the end-Triassic mass extinction$\backslash$nprovide a suitable trigger for an acidification event (full carbonate$\backslash$nundersaturation in the surface ocean is possible but improbable).$\backslash$n2) Tentative evidence for a global paucity of carbonate across the$\backslash$nend-Triassic mass extinction versus the adjacent stratigraphy is$\backslash$nconsistent with a predicted sedimentary response to acidification.$\backslash$n3) The end-Triassic mass extinction was particularly selective against$\backslash$nacid-sensitive organisms (more so than perhaps any other extinction$\backslash$nevent) and temporarily eliminated coral reefs. Therefore multiple$\backslash$nlines of evidence are consistent with a T-J ocean acidification event$\backslash$nwithin our current resolution to recognise such events in deep time.$\backslash$nThe conclusion that the end-Triassic extinction was influenced by$\backslash$nacidification implies that short-term acidification perturbations$\backslash$nmay have long-term effects on ecosystems, a repercussion that has$\backslash$npreviously not been established. Although anthropogenic emissions$\backslash$nare more rapid than any event in the geologic record, events such$\backslash$nas the T-J can serve as partial analogues for the present anthropogenic$\backslash$ncarbon release. Since the T-J was such a pronounced crisis for both$\backslash$nmodern-style marine invertebrates and scleractinian reefs, it is$\backslash$nof particular interest in terms of informing projections about the$\backslash$neffects of modern ocean acidification.

abstract = {The end of the Permian period is marked by global warming and the biggest known mass extinction on Earth. The crisis is commonly attributed to the formation of the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province although the causal mechanisms remain disputed. We show that heating of Tunguska Basin sediments by the ascending magma played a key role in triggering the crisis. Our conclusions are based on extensive field work in Siberia in 2004 and 2006. Heating of organic-rich shale and petroleum bearing evaporites around sill intrusions led to greenhouse gas and halocarbon generation in sufficient volumes to cause global warming and atmospheric ozone depletion. Basin scale gas production potential estimates show that metamorphism of organic matter and petroleum could have generated {\textgreater} 100,000 Gt CO2. The gases were released to the end-Permian atmosphere partly through spectacular pipe structures with kilometre-sized craters. Dating of a sill intrusion by the U-Pb method shows that the gas release occurred at 252.0 +/- 0.4 million years ago, overlapping in time with the end-Permian global warming and mass extinction. Heating experiments to 275 degrees C on petroleum-bearing rock salt from Siberia suggests that methyl chloride and methyl bromide were significant components of the erupted gases. The results indicate that global warming and ozone depletion were the two main drivers for the end-Permian environmental crisis. We demonstrate that the composition of the heated sedimentary rocks below the flood basalts is the most important factor in controlling whether a Large Igneous Provinces causes an environmental crisis or not. We propose that a similar mechanism could have been responsible for the Triassic-Jurassic (similar to 200 Ma) global warming and mass extinction, based on the presence of thick sill intrusions in the evaporite deposits of the Amazon Basin in Brazil.

abstract = {Carbonates have variable chemical composition and crystal structure, which can affect the accuracy of in situ (SIMS) isotopic measurements. Carbonate reference materials (calcite, dolomite, ankerite, magnesite, siderite, and rhodochrosite) were characterised for small delta18O by IRMS, and for the chemical composition by electron microprobe, and then used to evaluate the SIMS instrumental mass fractionation (IMF) of oxygen isotopes. A clear relationship between the IMF and the MgO (wt{\%}) content was observed during two different sessions for low Fe- and Mn-carbonates. For Fe- and Mn-bearing carbonates (i.e. more than 1 wt{\%}), Fe and Mn contents have to be taken into account for IMF correction. Due to the highly variable Mg content in carbonates, calibration using suitable carbonate reference materials with different Mg contents (i.e. calcite, dolomite, and magnesite) seems to be the best solution for performing accurate small delta18O measurements by SIMS. This matrix correction is not universally applied. Therefore the overall significance of uncorrected published small delta18O values from high Mg-carbonates has to be taken with caution. There are numerous applications of this method covering domains as varied as environmental studies (stromatolites, high-Mg calcite corals), geothermometry involving calcite co-existing with dolomite, or siderite co-existing with ankerite, and cosmochemical studies of carbonate phases in meteorites.},

abstract = {Relationships between organic carbon, total nitrogen and organic nitrogen concentrations and variations in $\delta$13Corg and $\delta$15Norg are examined in surface sediments from the eastern central Arctic Ocean and the Yermak Plateau. Removing the organic matter from samples with KOBr/KOH and determining residual as well as total N shows that there is a significant amount of bound inorganic N in the samples, which causes TOC/Ntotal ratios to be low (4–10 depending on the organic content). TOC/Norg ratios are significantly higher (8–16). This correction of organic TOC/N ratios for the presence of soil-derived bound ammonium is especially important in samples with high illite concentrations, the clay mineral mainly responsible for ammonium adsorption. The isotopic composition of the organic N fraction was estimated by determining the isotopic composition of the total and inorganic nitrogen fractions and assuming mass-balance. A strong correlation between $\delta$15Norg values of the sediments and the nitrate concentration of surface waters indicates different relative nitrate utilization rates of the phytoplankton in various regions of the Arctic Ocean. On the Yermak Plateau, low $\delta$15Norg values correspond to high nitrate concentrations, whereas in the central Arctic Ocean high $\delta$15Norg values are found beneath low nitrate waters. Sediment $\delta$13Corg values are close to −23.0‰ in the Yermak Plateau region and approximately −21.4‰ in the central Arctic Ocean. Particulate organic matter collected from meltwater ponds and ice-cores are relatively enriched in 13C ($\delta$13Corg=−15.3 to −20.6‰) most likely due to low CO2(aq) concentrations in these environments. A maximum terrestrial contribution of 30{\%} of the organic matter to sediments in the central Arctic Ocean is derived, based on the carbon isotope data and various assumptions about the isotopic composition of the potential endmembers.},

abstract = {Although it is widely believed that production of organic compounds by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and related processes occurs in many geologic environments, unambiguous identification of compounds with an abiotic origin in natural samples has been hampered by a lack of means to discriminate between abiotic compounds and organic matter from biological sources. While isotopic compositions might provide a means to discriminate between biologic and non-biologic sources of organic matter, there are few data presently available to constrain the isotopic composition of compounds produced by abiotic processes in geologic systems. Here, we report results of laboratory experiments conducted to evaluate the isotopic composition of organic compounds synthesized abiotically under hydrothermal conditions. We find the organic products are depleted in13C to a degree typically ascribed to biological processes, indicating that carbon isotopic composition may not be a particularly effective diagnostic means to differentiate between biologic and non-biologic sources. Furthermore, our results suggest that the isotopic compositions of reduced carbon compounds found in many ancient rocks that have heretofore been attributed to biological sources could be consistent with an abiotic origin in a hydrothermal setting. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most shallow marine sections described from the Lower Triassic formed in mixed carbonate-siliciclastic systems. Shallow marine limestones from an isolated carbonate platform, the Great Bank of Guizhou, in the Nanpanjiang Basin, South China, provide a unique opportunity to examine a pure peritidal carbonate depositional system. The platform had a low-relief bank profile in the Early Triassic with oolite shoals at the margin, shallow-subtidal and peritidal deposits in the interior, and pelagics, debris-flow deposits and turbidites on gentle basin-margin slopes. Interior strata are 265 m thick beginning in the lowermost Triassic with Renalcis biostromes, followed by lime mudstone, oolite, and cyclic peritidal limestone. The cyclic limestone is Olenekian in age, 164 m thick, and contains up to 83 cycles (parasequences). Parasequences are 0.2-7.4 m thick and typically shallow upward from subtidal oolite grainstone and skeletal packstone facies followed by Renalcis reef mounds or biostromes and capped by intertidal flaser-bedded ribbon rock. The skeletal packstone and reef mounds contain a low-diversity biota of cyanobacteria, echinoderms, bivalves, gastropods, lingulid brachiopods, spirorbids, and ostracodes. Ribbon rock contains alternating lime mud and fine peloidal packstone and grainstone laminae, scour surfaces, ripple cross lamination, lime-mud drapes, and minor prism cracks. Parasequence stacking patterns exhibit gradual increase and decrease of parasequence thickness, defining a third-order sequence boundary and several 4th-order parasequence sets that correlate between interior sections. Parasequence stacking patterns similar to those of Lower Palaeozoic green-house sequences and different from ice-house sequences. The Lower Triassic platform-interior parasequences represent an anachronistic facies in that they are strikingly similar to the common Renalcis-mound, ribbon rock parasequences of the Lower Palaeozoic and different from other Permo-Triassic parasequences (e.g. Capitan shelf parasequences or Loferites). Facies similarities such as Renalcis mounds and flaser-bedded intertidal ribbon rock reflect anomalous oceanic conditions resulting in low biodiversity and low intensity of bioturbation after the end-Permian extinction. Similarities in parasequence stacking patterns reflect low-amplitude, high-frequency sea-level fluctuations resulting from green-house conditions common to the Early Palaeozoic and Early Triassic. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The stable isotope geochemistry of Miocene sediments from the leeward margin of the Great Bahama Bank was examined to investigate burial diagenetic processes in periplatform carbonates. Data indicate that, in addition to differences in bulk proportions of neritic and pelagic carbonate along the slope, rhythmic variation in primary carbonate content has controlled patterns of burial diagenesis and associated geochemical signatures throughout much of the succession examined. The present study focuses on Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1006 and 1007, the most distal of five sites drilled from marginal to deep basin environments during Leg 166. These Miocene sections are characterized by their cyclic appearance, manifest as decimetre- to metre-scale alternations between light-coloured ooze/chalk/limestone and dark-coloured marl/marlstone. The section at Site 1006 contains a high proportion of pelagic carbonate and is unlithified to a subbottom depth of similar to 675 m. Fluctuations in delta O-18 and delta C-13 values at this site are independent of lithological variation and reflect primary conditions. At Site 1007, located at the toe-of-slope and composed of a mixture of bank-derived and pelagic carbonate, limestones are densely cemented, show little evidence of compaction and have delta O-18 values up to 2 parts per thousand higher than coeval sediments at Site 1006. Marlstones at Site 1007 are poorly cemented, exhibit an increase in compaction-related features with depth and have lower and more variable delta O-18 values that are similar to those of coeval sediments at Site 1006. Isotopic and petrographic characteristics of limestone interbeds result from cement precipitation from cold sea water during the first similar to 100 m of burial. Higher proportions of insoluble materials and pelagic carbonate seem to have inhibited diagenetic alteration in adjacent marlstones; in spite of significant compaction and pressure solution during burial, original isotopic compositions appear to be best preserved in these intervals at Site 1007. The documented contrasts in petrographic and isotopic patterns illustrate the role of primary sediment composition in controlling lithification processes in periplatform carbonates and stress the importance of considering such factors when interpreting geochemical data from ancient shelf and slope limestones.},

abstract = {Our measurements of high-resolution spectra of Mars at 3.7 and 8 mu m revealed 200 lines of (OCO)-O-16-C-12-O-17, (OCO)-O-16- C-12-O-18, and (OCO)-O-16-C-13-O-18 isotopes. Among them are 38 lines which are absent in spectroscopic databases, Eighty lines of the three isotopes with closely equivalent widths were chosen to determine the oxygen and carbon isotope ratios in CO2. A radiation transfer code which coupled the reflected solar and thermal radiation was developed, This code divided the atmosphere into 30 layers and the Voigt profile of each line in each layer into 60 intervals. This results in a determination of the atmospheric pressure P-0 = 7.4 +/- 0.4 mbar and the isotope ratios O-18/O-17 = 0.914 +/- 0.04 and C- 13/C-12 = 0.94 +/- 0.15 scaled to CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere. Scaling to SMOW gives O-18/O-17 = 0.93 +/- 0.04; assuming the same initial isotope ratio on Mars and Earth, we find that O-18/O-16 = 0.87 +/- 0.08 in CO2 on Mars. Oxygen and carbon isotope fractionation factors of 0.774 and 0.891 in the escape processes were calculated using individual heights of homopauses for different species. Oxygen and carbon isotope ratios are determined by the present water amount, the regolith-atmosphere-cap reservoir of CO2, the carbonate abundance, the initial abundance of CO2, and losses of H2O and CO2 by escape processes. Two processes affect the carbon isotope ratio in the atmosphere: formation of carbonates and sputtering of CO2. This ratio was calculated as a function of the CO2 sputtering after the end of impact erosion of the atmosphere at 0.8 byr. A weighted-mean value of C-13/C-12 = 0.97 +/- 0.05 (scaled to PDB) for three measurements in the martian atmosphere and determinations of the carbon isotope ratio in carbonates of the SNC meteorites require CO2 escape by sputtering to be smaller than 10 mbar. The oxygen isotope ratio could be depleted in water early in the history of Mars by water-silicate equilibrium; this does not contradict the isotopic composition of the SNC meteorites, Fractionation with CO2 and loss of CO2 by impact erosion depleted heavy oxygen in water as well. We calculated delta(18)O approximate to -70 parts per thousand in water vapor for preferred values of the initial CO2 of 7.5 bars, water escape of 30 m, and the present water ice reservoir of 500 m, Taking into account uncertainities of these values by a factor of 2-3, the expected minimum value of delta(18)O in water vapor is close to -110 parts per thousand and does not agree with some recent determinations. Heavy oxygen in CO2 should either be equal to that in water vapor (in the case of photochemical mixing) or exceed that in water vapor by 90 parts per thousand (in the case of thermodynamic equilibrium). Currently the calculated values of delta(18)O may serve as a guide to measured values which show large scatter and uncertainties. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

abstract = {The oxygen isotope ratio ($\delta$18O) of inorganic and biogenic carbonates is widely used to reconstruct past environments. However, the oxygen isotope exchange between CaCO3 and H2O rarely reaches equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects (KIE) commonly complicate paleoclimate reconstructions. We present a comprehensive model of kinetic and equilibrium oxygen isotope fractionation between CaCO3 and water ($\alpha$c/w) that accounts for fractionation between both (a) CaCO3 and the CO32− pool ($\alpha$c/CO32-), and (b) CO32− and water ($\alpha$CO32-/w), as a function of temperature, pH, salinity, calcite saturation state ($\Omega$), the residence time of the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in solution, and the activity of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. The model results suggest that: (1) The equilibrium $\alpha$c/w is only approached in solutions with low $\Omega$ (i.e. close to 1) and low ionic strength such as in the cave system of Devils Hole, Nevada. (2) The sensitivity of $\alpha$c/w to the solution pH and/or the mineral growth rate depends on the level of isotopic equilibration between the CO32− pool and water. When the CO32− pool approaches isotopic equilibrium with water, small negative pH and/or growth rate effects on $\alpha$c/w of about 1–2‰ occur where these parameters covary with $\Omega$. In contrast, isotopic disequilibrium between CO32− and water leads to strong ({\textgreater}2‰) positive or negative pH and growth rate effects on $\alpha$CO32-/w (and $\alpha$c/w) due to the isotopic imprint of oxygen atoms derived from HCO3−, CO2, H2O and/or OH−. (3) The temperature sensitivity of $\alpha$c/w originates from the negative effect of temperature on $\alpha$CO32-/w and is expected to deviate from the commonly accepted value (−0.22 ± 0.02‰/°C between 0 and 30 °C; Kim and O'Neil, 1997) when the CO32− pool is not in isotopic equilibrium with water. (4) The model suggests that the $\delta$18O of planktic and benthic foraminifers reflects a quantitative precipitation of DIC in isotopic equilibrium with a high-pH calcifying fluid, leading to a relatively constant foraminifer calcite $\delta$18O-temperature relationship (−0.21 ± 0.01‰/°C). The lower average coral $\delta$18O data relative to foraminifers and other calcifiers is best explained by the precipitation of internal DIC derived from hydrated CO2 in a high-pH calcifying fluid and minimal subsequent DIC-H2O isotopic equilibration. This leads to a reduced and variable coral aragonite $\delta$18O-temperature relationship (−0.11 to −0.22‰/°C). Together, the model presented here reconciles observations of oxygen isotope fractionation over a range of CaCO3-DIC-H2O systems.},

abstract = {The continental to marine Upper Triassic – Jurassic succession of the Danish Basin and the Fennoscandian Border Zone is interpreted within a sequence stratigraphic framework, and the evolution of the depositional basin is discussed. The intracratonic Permian–Cenozoic Danish Basin was formed by Late Carboniferous – Early Permian crustal extension followed by subsidence governed primarily by thermal cooling and local faulting. The basin is separated from thestable Precambrian Baltic Shield by the Fennoscandian Border Zone, and is bounded by basement blocks of the Ringk{\o}bing–Fyn High towards the south. In Late Triassic – Jurassic times, the basin was part of the epeiric shallow sea that covered most of northern Europe. The Upper Triassic – Jurassic basin-fill is subdivided into two tectono-stratigraphic units by a basinwide intra-Aalenian unconformity. The Norian – Lower Aalenian succession was formed under relative tectonic tranquillity and shows an overall layer-cake geometry, except for areas with local faults and salt movements.Deposition was initiated by a Norian transgression that led to shallow marine deposition and was accompanied by a gradual climatic change to more humid conditions. Extensive sheets of shoreface sand and associated paralic sediments were deposited during short-lived forced regressions in Rhaetian time. A stepwise deepening and development of fully marine conditions followed in the Hettangian – Early Sinemurian. Thick uniform basinwide mud blankets weredeposited on an open storm-influenced shelf, while sand was trapped at the basin margins. This depositional pattern continued until Late Toarcian – Early Aalenian times when the basin became restricted due to renewed uplift of the Ringk{\o}bing–Fyn High. In Middle Aalenian – Bathonian times, the former basin area was subjected to deep erosion, and deposition became restricted to the fault-bounded Sorgenfrei–Tornquist Zone. Eventually the fault margins were overstepped,and paralic–marine deposition gradually resumed in most of the basin in Late Jurassic time. Thus, the facies architecture of the Norian – Lower Aalenian succession reflects eustatic or large-scale regional sea-level changes, whereas the Middle Aalenian – Volgian succession reflects a strong tectonic control that gradually gave way to more widespread and sea-level controlled sedimentation.The uplift of the Ringk{\o}bing–Fyn High and most of the Danish Basin occurred concurrently with the uplift of the North Sea and a wide irregular uplifted area was formed, which differs significantly from the postulated domal pattern.},

abstract = {Land-plant productivity was greatly reduced after the end-Permian mass extinction, causing a pronounced "coal gap" worldwide during the Early Triassic. Newly obtained organic geochemistry data from the Chaohu area, south China, indicated an abrupt and profound terrestrial vegetation change over the middle part of the Early Triassic Smithian-Spathian (S-S) interval. Herbaceous lycopsids and/or bryophytes dominated terrestrial vegetation from Griesbachian to Smithian times. The terrestrial ecosystem underwent an abrupt change, and woody conifers became dominant over the S-S interval. Several important biomarkers, namely retene, simonellite, and dehydroabietane (with multiple sources: conifer, lycopsid, and/or herbaceous bryophyte), were relatively abundant during Griesbachian, Dienerian, and Smithian times. The relatively low C/N ratio values during the Griesbachian-Smithian interval indicate that these biomarkers were likely sourced from herbaceous lycopsids and/or bryophytes. The extremely abundant conifer-sourced pimanthrene, combined with relatively high C/N ratio values, suggested the recovery of woody conifers after the S-S boundary. The new data revealed that the switch from herbaceous vegetation to woody coniferous vegetation marked a terrestrial plant recovery, which occurred globally within 3 million years after the end-Permian crisis rather than at a later date estimated in previous studies. In Chaohu, the S-S terrestrial event was marked by a reappearance of woody vegetation, while the S-S marine event was marked by an increase in ichnodiversity, trace complexity, burrow size, infaunal tiering level, and bioturbation level, and a possible intense upwelling event indicated by the extended tricyclic terpane ratios (ETR). Coeval vegetation changes with comparable patterns have also been documented in Europe and Pakistan based on palynologic studies. The S-S boundaries in Asia and Europe are associated with a positive $\delta$13C excursion, the rebound of woody vegetation, a turnover of ammonoid faunas, and possible global climate cooling. This is the first study to document the S-S event using biomarkers and C/N ratios. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Background: The pattern and timing of the rise in complex multicellular life during Earth's history has not been established. Great disparity persists between the pattern suggested by the fossil record and that estimated by molecular clocks, especially for plants, animals, fungi, and the deepest branches of the eukaryote tree. Here, we used all available protein sequence data and molecular clock methods to place constraints on the increase in complexity through time. Results: Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that (i) animals are more closely related to fungi than to plants, (ii) red algae are closer to plants than to animals or fungi, (iii) choanoflagellates are closer to animals than to fungi or plants, (iv) diplomonads, euglenozoans, and alveolates each are basal to plants+animals+fungi, and (v) diplomonads are basal to other eukaryotes (including alveolates and euglenozoans). Divergence times were estimated from global and local clock methods using 20– 188 proteins per node, with data treated separately (multigene) and concatenated (supergene). Different time estimation methods yielded similar results (within 5{\%}): vertebrate-arthropod (964 million years ago, Ma), Cnidaria-Bilateria (1,298 Ma), Porifera-Eumetozoa (1,351 Ma), Pyrenomycetes-Plectomycetes (551 Ma), Candida-Saccharomyces (723 Ma), Hemiascomycetes-filamentous Ascomycota (982 Ma), Basidiomycota-Ascomycota (968 Ma), Mucorales-Basidiomycota (947 Ma), Fungi-Animalia (1,513 Ma), mosses-vascular plants (707 Ma), Chlorophyta-Tracheophyta (968 Ma), Rhodophyta-Chlorophyta+Embryophyta (1,428 Ma), Plantae-Animalia (1,609 Ma), Alveolata-plants+animals+fungi (1,973 Ma), Euglenozoa-plants+animals+fungi (1,961 Ma), and Giardia-plants+animals+fungi (2,309 Ma). By extrapolation, mitochondria arose approximately 2300-1800 Ma and plastids arose 1600-1500 Ma. Estimates of the maximum number of cell types of common ancestors, combined with divergence times, showed an increase from two cell types at 2500 Ma to {\~{}}10 types at 1500 Ma and 50 cell types at {\~{}}1000 Ma. Conclusions: The results suggest that oxygen levels in the environment, and the ability of eukaryotes to extract energy from oxygen, as well as produce oxygen, were key factors in the rise of complex multicellular life. Mitochondria and organisms with more than 2–3 cell types appeared soon after the initial increase in oxygen levels at 2300 Ma. The addition of plastids at 1500 Ma, allowing eukaryotes to produce oxygen, preceded the major rise in complexity.},

abstract = {The end-Triassic mass extinction (c. 201.6 Ma) was one of the five largest mass-extinction events in the history of animal life. It was also associated with a dramatic, long-lasting change in sedimentation style along the margins of the Tethys Ocean, from generally organic-matter-poor sediments during the Triassic to generally organic-matter- rich black shales during the Jurassic. New core material from Germany provides biomarker evidence of persistent photic zone euxinia during the Hettangian, the onset of which is associated with a series of both negative and positive carbon isotope excursions. Combined inorganic and organic geo- chemical and micropalaeontological analyses reveal strong similarities between the Hettangian and the better-known Toarcian anoxic event. These events appear to be the most clearly expressed events within a series of anoxic episodes that also include poorly studied black shale intervals during the Sinemurian and Pliensbachian. Both the Hettangian and Toarcian events are marked by important changes in phyto- plankton assemblages from chromophyte- to chlorophyte- dominated assemblages within the European Epicontinental Seaway. Phytoplankton changes occurred in association with the establishment of photic-zone euxinia, driven by a general increase in salinity stratification and warming of surface waters. For both events, the causes of large negative carbon isotope excursions remain incompletely understood; evidence exists for both variation in the $\delta$13C of atmospheric CO2 and variation in the sources of organic carbon. Regardless of the causes of $\delta$13C variability, long-term ocean anoxia during the Early Jurassic can be attributed to greenhouse warming and increased nutrient delivery to the oceans triggered by flood basalt volcanism.},

abstract = {The oxygen and strontium isotopic composition of 125 teeth of the hybodont sharks Lissodus and Hybodus from various late Triassic (Rhaetian) bone bed localities in the Central European Basin are used as environmental and ecological tracers for the shallow epicontinental Rhaetian Sea. The preservation of tooth enameloid was ascertained by cathodoluminescence microscopy. Mean $\delta$ 18O P values differ regionally across the Rhaetian Sea with values of 18.6±0.6‰ near the western gate, 16.1±0.8‰ in the east, 15.4±0.6‰ in the southeast, and 17.7±0.9‰ in the south. The $\delta$ 18O P values in the eastern Rhaetian Sea are 4-5‰ lower relative to Tethyan seawater, while teeth from the southern and western parts close to the marine gates are less fractionated. The strontium isotopic composition of teeth from most localities is more radiogenic in comparison to late Triassic seawater. The observed spatial $\delta$ 18O P trend in the Rhaetian Sea indicates a shift from marine to brackish conditions in the south and west towards extensively brackish conditions with salinities of less than 16‰ in the east, thus confirming the existence of two marine gates. Brackish conditions persisted throughout early Rhaetian times, and were maintained by increased fluvial discharge from the Vindelician-Bohemian and Fennoscandian Highs as a result of enhanced atmospheric moisture availability in the course of the Rhaetian transgression. The $\delta$ 18O P values of Lissodus and Hybodus indicate euryhaline behaviour of Rhaetian hybodonts by exceeding modern shark intraspecific variability. The lack of accordance in $\delta$ 18O P values between different isotopically conspicuous localities in the Rhaetian Sea contradicts a basin-wide migration pattern. Differences between co-site taxa might indicate some degree of niche partitioning. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The carbon ($\delta$13Corg) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) isotopic compositions of bulk organic matter were analyzed in two high-resolution Permian-Triassic transitional sections containing microbialite in south China. The results from these shallow-marine sections show that an abrupt negative shift in $\delta$15N, from ∼+3‰ to ∼0‰, occurred immediately after the latest Permian mass extinction (LPE) in both sections, concurrent with a distinct negative shift in $\delta$13Corg. The persistently low values of $\delta$15N suggest that, following the LPE, microbial nitrogen fixation became the main source of biologically available nitrogen in the Nanpanjiang Basin and perhaps over a broader region of the eastern Paleotethys Ocean. Enhanced N fixation is probably indicative of the prevalence of stratified anoxic water masses characterized by intense denitrification and/or anaerobic ammonium oxidation at the time. Perturbation of the marine nitrogen cycle might have contributed to high temperatures following the main marine mass extinction through the release of the greenhouse gas N2O. The sharp declines in $\delta$15N and $\delta$13Corg may be ascribed to an abrupt change in shallow-water microbial communities, which differed in composition from contemporaneous deep-water communities.},

abstract = {Nitrogen isotopes are an important tool for evaluating past biogeochemical cycling from the paleoceanographic record. However, bulk sedimentary nitrogen isotope ratios, which can be determined routinely and at minimal cost, may be altered during burial and early sedimentary diagenesis, particularly outside of continental margin settings. The causes and detailed mechanisms of isotopic alteration are still under investigation. Case studies of the Mediterranean and South China Seas underscore the complexities of investigating isotopic alteration. In an effort to evaluate the evidence for alteration of the sedimentary N isotopic signal and try to quantify the net effect, we have compiled and compared data demonstrating alteration from the published literature. A {\textgreater}100 point comparison of sediment trap and surface sedimentary nitrogen isotope values demonstrates that, at sites located off of the continental margins, an increase in sediment 15N/14N occurs during early burial, likely at the seafloor. The extent of isotopic alteration appears to be a function of water depth. Depth-related differences in oxygen exposure time at the seafloor are likely the dominant control on the extent of N isotopic alteration. Moreover, the compiled data suggest that the degree of alteration is likely to be uniform through time at most sites so that bulk sedimentary isotope records likely provide a good means for evaluating relative changes in the global N cycle.},

abstract = {Closed reactor kinetic experiments, SEM and TEM imaging, EDX analyses, and zeta potential measurements were used to assess the existence of metabolic process protecting cyanobacteria against carbonate mineralization on their surfaces. Carbonate precipitation rates measured at pH of ???8.2 and 23 ??C in initially supersaturated solutions in the presence of active Synechococcus sp. and Planktothrix sp. correspond closely to those measured in analogous inorganic control experiments. TEM imaging and EDX analysis indicates the absence of Ca2+ on active Synechococcus sp. and Planktothrix sp. surfaces. Electrophoretic measurements of active cyanobacteria surfaces demonstrate development of a positive surface potential on active Synechococcus sp. and Planktothrix sp. cyanobacteria at pH 8-10. This positive charge was suppressed by the presence of 1 mM HCO3- but enhanced by increasing aqueous Ca2+ concentration in the fluid phase. These observations suggest the existence of a mechanism, based on the metabolic maintenance of a positive surface charge at alkaline pH, protecting active cyanobacteria against Ca2+ adsorption and subsequent carbonate precipitation on their surfaces. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We investigated delta(13)carbon (C)-dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) values in 72 lakes from diverse regions using literature data as well as new measurements for 32 lakes. delta(13)C-DIC varied broadly among lakes from -31 to +2.6parts per thousand. This variation of surface-water delta(13)C-DIC among lakes is greater than the seasonal variation within most lakes. Several statistical models account for a large portion of the interlake variation and indicate that geochemical (e.g., DIC, pH, alkalinity) and morphometric (area) variables are important, whereas biological (e.g., gross primary productivity [GPP], respiration [R], chlorophyll a) variables are generally not significant. A process-based model including gas exchange with the atmosphere, inorganic carbon speciation, and ecosystem metabolism was also constructed. The model provides a reasonable fit to the data for lakes, in which respiration exceeded GPP (heterotrophic lakes; 75{\%} of lakes sampled). Lakes for which GPP exceeded respiration (autotrophic) were not fit well by the process-based model. The data and models indicate that metabolism creates substantial variation in delta(13)C-DIC around the potential delta(13)C-DIC that is set by geochemical factors of the watershed.},

@article{Canfield1999,
abstract = {There are 2 principal avenues of inquiry relevant to reconstruct- ing the history of the sulfur cycle. One avenue relies on the comparison of molecular sequences derived from biologically essential proteins and genetic material. Most sequence information is available from the small subunit of the rRNA molecule and from these sequences a Tree of Life emerges providing a reconstruction of the evolutionary relationships among organisms. Near the root of the tree are numerous bacteria1metabolizing sulfur species including organ- isms living from dissimilatory elemental sulfur reduction, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and anoxygenic photosynthesis. These metabolisms are likely very ancient. Many of the deep-branching bacteria of the sulfur cycle are active at very high temperatures (hyperthermophiles) and are commonly found in modern sulfide-rich hydrothermal systems. One can imagine a primitive early Earth terrestrial ecosystem housed around active hydrothermal areas with anoxygenic photosynthesis producing organic matter and oxidized sulfur species. These oxidized sulfur species could have been used as electron acceptors in the mineral- ization of organic matter, completing the carbon cycle. The evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis provided for dramatically increased rates of carbon production, and a much wider range of ecosystems for both carbon production, and carbon oxidation. Either associated with, or following, the evolution of oxygenic photo- synthesis is the emergence of lineages housing most of the bacteria of which we are familiar, including most of the bacteria of the sulfur cycle. The geologic record can provide direct evidence for the state of chemical oxidation of the Earth-surface, with possible indications of when specific bacterial metabolisms first occurred. We offer the following scenario for the evolution of the Earth-surface environment based on the available geological evidence. By 3.5 Ga anoxygenic photosynthesis was established and provided a weak source of sulfate to the global ocean with sulfate concentrations likely 91 mM. In some instances locally high concentrations of sulfate could accumulate and precipi- tated as evaporitic sulfate minerals. There is no compelling evidence for sulfate reduction at this time. The first evidence for sulfate reduction is found between 2.7 and 2.5 Ga, and the first evidence for oxygen production by oxygenic photosynthesis is found at around 2.8 Ga. Even so, levels of seawater sulfate remained low, below 1 mM, and did not increase toG1mMuntil around 2.3 Ga. This increase in sulfate levels may have been promoted by a rise in atmospheric oxygen concentration at this time. Throughout the Archean and early Protero- zoic the deep oceans contained appreciable concentrations of dissolved ferrous iron, and banded iron formations (BIFs) were a common form of chemical sediment. Sulfate levels increased slowly, and by 1.8 Ga sulfate concentrations were sufficient to increase rates of sulfate reduction to greater than the delivery flux of iron to the oceans. Sulfide accumulated and precipitated ferrous iron from solution. It is proposed that the oceans remained sulfide-rich until the Neoprotero- zoic, where renewed deposition of banded iron formations occurred at around 0.75 Ga. It is possible that during the Neoproterozoic, decreased carbon produc- tion resulted from an ice covered ‘‘Snowball Earth'' reducing rates of sulfate reduction below rates of iron delivery to the oceans, promoting BIF formation. At around this time high carbon burial rates increased levels of atmospheric oxygen toG10 percent present-day levels, promoting the widespread oxidation of marine surface sediments and an evolutionary radiation of sulfide oxidizing bacteria. *},

abstract = {A unique and essential feature of germ cells is their immortality. In Caenorhabditis elegans, germline immortality requires the maternal contribution from four genes, mes-2, mes-3, mes-4 and mes-6. We report here that mes-2 encodes a protein similar to the Drosophila Polycomb group protein, Enhancer of zeste, and in the accompanying paper that mes-6 encodes another Polycomb group protein. The Polycomb group is responsible for maintaining proper patterns of expression of the homeotic and other genes in Drosophila. It is thought that Polycomb group proteins form heteromeric complexes and control gene expression by altering chromatin conformation of target genes. As predicted from its similarity to a Polycomb group protein, MES-2 localizes to nuclei. MES-2 is found in germline nuclei in larval and adult worms and in all nuclei in early embryos. By the end of embryogenesis, MES-2 is detected primarily in the two primordial germ cells. The correct distribution of MES-2 requires the wild-type functions of mes-3 and mes-6. We hypothesize that mes-2 encodes a maternal regulator of gene expression in the early germline; its function is essential for normal early development and viability of germ cells.},

abstract = {Depth profiles of the stable sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate in near-surface sediments were measured at five stations of the deep Arabian Sea between 1918 and 4426 m water depth (WAST, WAST-Top, CAST, SAST, NAST), sampled in April 1997. The results clearly indicate that net microbial sulfate reduction took place in the sediments at stations WAST and NAST below about 12 cm depth. Sulfate reduction at WAST was more pronounced compared to station NAST, most likely due to higher organic carbon content in turbiditic sediments. No net sulfate reduction took place within the upper 10 cm of the surface sediments at all stations, and no significant isotopic indication for sulfate reduction was found down to 30 cm bsf at station SAST. Results are in accordance with accumulation of reduced isotopically light sulfur species below about 6 cm bsf at station WAST. It is concluded that the sulfur isotopic composition of remaining sulfate is more sensitive to net sulfate reduction than the [SO4]/[Cl] ratio. The sulfur isotopic composition of a vertical profile for dissolved sulfate through the water column at station WAST was essentially constant (250-4047 m: $\delta$34S = + 20.49 ± 0.08{\%}0 VS. V-CDT n = 8). A similar constancy (20-4565 m water depth $\delta$34S = + 20.57 ± 0.06{\%}0 VS. V-CDT n = 15) was found for the station BIOTRANS in the northeastern Atlantic (47°11' 19°33W), indicating that the oxygen minimum zone in the Arabian Sea has no influence on the sulfur isotopic composition of dissolved sulfate.

The SEDEX method successfully separates two of the main categories of authigenic phosphate phases called upon most often as sedimentary sinks for diagenetically mobilized P: ferric oxyhydroxide-associated P and authigenic carbonate fluorapatite (CFAP). It offers a means for separating authigenic CFAP from detrital apatite of igneous or metamorphic origin. The importance of this distinction is that CFAP represents an oceanic sink for reactive P, whereas detrital apatite does not. In addition, a means for reversing secondary adsorption of P onto residual solid surfaces during extraction has been developed. Extensive standardization of the SEDEX method for application to marine sediments has been performed with analogs for naturally occurring phosphatic phases.},

abstract = {An oxygen and carbon isotopic history based on analyses of benthonic and planktonic foraminifera in three overlapping subantarctic sections is presented for the last 55 m.y. with a sampling interval of less than 1 m.y. Surface temperature at Site 277, on the Campbell Plateau, was about 19 degrees C in the Early Eocene, about 13 degrees C in the Middle Eocene, about 11 degrees C in the Late Eocene, and about 7 degrees C in the Oligocene. Declines in temperature appear to have been rather rapid and are separated by episodes of relative temperature stability. Bottom temperature at Site 277 was about 1 degree C below surface temperature in the Paleocene and about 2 degrees C below surface temperature in the Oligocene. Site 279, on the Macquarie Ridge, records an Early Miocene warming of over 2 degrees C followed by a cooling and a second similar temperature rise in the Middle Miocene. Bottom temperature at this somewhat deeper site was about 3 degrees C below surface temperature and was probably as low as 4 degrees C during part of the Early Miocene. Comparisons between sites 277 and 279 suggest that from the Early Oligocene temperatures of deep water were low like the present day, implying that the mean annual temperature in high southern latitudes was near freezing by the beginning of the Oligocene (but certainly no earlier). From this time glaciers would have descended to sea level, and there would have been sea-ice production. If an ice sheet were present, it could not have been more than a small fraction of its present-day size. Site 281, on the South Tasman Rise, extends the record into the Middle and Late Miocene during which time the major East Antarctic ice sheet accumulated. A significant rise in surface temperature during the Late Miocene did not cause the melting of this ice sheet, demonstrating that by this time it had already achieved its present invulnerability to climatic change. Since temperatures during much of the Miocene were significantly above any Pleistocene values, it is extremely unlikely that any climatic change in the geologically near future will significantly affect the stability of the East Antarctic ice sheet.},

abstract = {A new mass balance model for the coupled marine cycles of phosphorus (P) and carbon (C) is used to examine the relationships between oceanic circulation, primary productivity, and sedimentary burial of reactive P and particulate organic C (POC), on geological time scales. The model explicitly represents the exchanges of water and particulate matter between the continental shelves and the open ocean, and it accounts for the redox-dependent burial of POC and the various forms of reactive P (iron(III)-bound P, particulate organic P (POP), authigenic calcium phosphate, and fish debris). Steady state and transient simulations indicate that a slowing down of global ocean circulation decreases primary production in the open ocean, but increases that in the coastal ocean. The latter is due to increased transfer of soluble P from deep ocean water to the shelves, where it fuels primary production and causes increased reactive P burial. While authigenic calcium phosphate accounts for most reactive P burial ocean-wide, enhanced preservation of fish debris may become an important reactive P sink in deep-sea sediments during periods of ocean anoxia. Slower ocean circulation globally increases POC burial, because of enhanced POC preservation under anoxia in deep-sea depositional environments and higher primary productivity along the continental margins. In accordance with geological evidence, the model predicts increased accumulation of reactive P on the continental shelves during and following periods of ocean anoxia.},

abstract = {Carbonate-associated sulphate (CAS) extracted from a Permo–Triassic succession at Siusi in northern Italy is shown to preserve a true seawater-sulphate isotope record. Two periods of increasing $\delta$34S and $\delta$18O in CAS provide evidence for increased oceanic anoxia in the Late Permian and the Early Triassic. These two anoxic episodes are separated by an event characterised by the addition of isotopically light sulphur and oxygen to the oceanic sulphate pool. Simple mass balance calculations suggest that this sulphate originates from the reoxidation of bacterially derived H2S during oceanic mixing, rather than a volcanogenic source. A dramatic fall in CAS-$\delta$18O directly above the P–T boundary, not accompanied by a large change in CAS-$\delta$34S, records an oceanic deoxygenation event probably caused by the release of methane from gas hydrates, subsequently recorded in the carbonate-carbon isotope record. The decline of Early Triassic oceanic anoxia is not recorded by a fall in CAS-$\delta$34S, but is preserved by declining CAS-$\delta$18O. This is because of an increase in the flux of reactive iron to the oceans during the Early Triassic anoxic episode, triggered by the demise of land plants. This permanently removes a greater proportion of light sulphur from the oceanic sulphate reservoir as pyrite, and means that the heavy residual sulphate-sulphur isotope signature of Griesbachian anoxic seawater is preserved as a geochemical ‘fossil' until the beginning of the Middle Triassic.},

abstract = {A total of 280 brachiopods of Ordovician to Cretaceous age, complemented by published data from belemnites and planktonic foraminifera, are used to reconstruct the evolution of calcium isotope composition of seawater ($\delta$44/40CaSW) over the Phanerozoic. The compiled $\delta$44/40CaSW record shows a general increase from ∼1.3‰ (NIST SRM 915a) at the beginning of the Ordovician to ∼2‰ at present. Superimposed on this trend is a major long-term positive excursion from the Early Carboniferous to Early Permian as well as several short-term, mostly negative, oscillations. A numerical model of the global cycles of calcium, carbon, magnesium and strontium was used to estimate whether the recorded $\delta$44/40CaSW variations can be explained by varying magnitudes of input and output fluxes of calcium to the oceans. The model uses the record of marine 87Sr/86Sr ratios as proxy for seafloor spreading rates, a record of oceanic Mg/Ca ratios to estimate rates of dolomite formation, and reconstructed atmospheric CO2, discharge and erosion rates to estimate continental weathering fluxes. The model results indicate that varying magnitudes of the calcium input and output fluxes cannot explain the observed $\delta$44/40CaSW trends, suggesting that the isotope signatures of these fluxes must also have changed. As a possible mechanism we suggest variable isotope fractionation in the sedimentary output flux controlled by the dominant mineralogy in marine carbonate deposits, i.e. the oscillating ‘calcite–aragonite seas'. The ultimate control of the calcium isotope budget of the Phanerozoic oceans appears to have been tectonic processes, specifically variable rates of oceanic crust production that modulated the hydrothermal calcium flux and the oceanic Mg/Ca ratio, which in turn controlled the dominant mineralogy of marine carbonates, hence the $\delta$44/40CaSW. As to the causes of the short-term oscillations recorded in the secular $\delta$44/40CaSW trend, we tentatively propose that these are related to variable rates of dolomite formation and/or to changing chemical composition of the riverine flux, in particular Ca/HCO3- and Ca/SO42- ratios, induced by variable proportions of silicate vs. carbonate weathering rates on the continents.},

Two sites near Chipping Sodbury, south Gloucestershire, Barnhill Quarry and Chipping Sodbury railway cutting, show differing faunas. Top predators are the large bony fish Severnichthys and the shark Hybodus cloacinus, which preyed on smaller sharks such as Lissodus and Rhomphaiodon. These fishes in turn may have fed on a mixed diet of other fishes and invertebrates, and Lissodus was a shell crusher. Comparisons of these faunas with others described recently from the Bristol region, and from Devon, indicate remarkable faunal similarities in the Rhaetian basal Westbury Formation bone bed over a wide area, based on a variety of ecological statistics that document species diversities and relative abundances. Only the fauna from the Chipping Sodbury railway cutting differs significantly.},

abstract = {The process of collecting and organizing sets of observations represents a common theme throughout the history of science. However, despite the ubiquity of scientists measuring, recording and analysing the dynamics of different processes, an extensive organization of scientific time-series data and analysis methods has never been performed. Addressing this, annotated collections of over 35 000 real-world and model-generated time series, and over 9000 time-series analysis algorithms are analysed in this work.We introduce reduced representations of both time series, in terms of their properties measured by diverse scientific methods, and of time-series analysis methods, in terms of their behaviour on empirical time series, and use them to organize these interdisciplinary resources. This new approach to comparing across diverse scientific data and methods allows us to organize time-series datasets automatically according to their properties, retrieve alternatives to particular analysis methods developed in other scientific disciplines and automate the selection of useful methods for time-series classification and regression tasks. The broad scientific utility of these tools is demonstrated on datasets of electroencephalograms, self-affine time series, heartbeat intervals, speech signals and others, in each case contributing novel analysis techniques to the existing literature. Highly comparative techniques that compare across an interdisciplinary literature can thus be used to guide more focused research in time-series analysis for applications across the scientific disciplines. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This system can be used in core and field-based studies and consists of two parts. (1) A bioturbation index in which a descriptive grade is assigned to the degree of bioturbation. This integrates the sedimentology and ichnology, where the higher grades of bioturbation result from increased burrow overlap and the subsequent loss of the primary sedimentary fabric. (2) An ichnofabric constituent diagram which records the detail of the ichnofabric by graphically plotting the dimensional data of the ichnotaxa and their order of emplacement against their coverage. This scheme differs from previous attempts to characterize bioturbation using semi-quantatitive methods and visually portrays the ichnofabric so that comparative studies can be carried out. This is of particular use in facies analysis, the establishment of the ichnocoenoses and tier diagrams, and within sequence stratigraphic studies so that hiatal surfaces can be recognized.},

abstract = {Although Siberian Trap volcanism is considered a primary driver of the largest extinction in Earth history, the end-Permian crisis, the relationship between these events remains unclear. However, malformations in fossilized gymnosperm pollen from the extinction interval suggest biological stress coinciding with pulsed forest decline. These grains are hypothesized to have been caused by enhanced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation from volcanism-induced ozone shield deterioration. We tested this proposed mechanism by observing the effects of inferred end-Permian UV-B regimes on pollen development and reproductive success in living conifers. We find that pollen malformation frequencies increase fivefold under high UV-B intensities. Surprisingly, all trees survived but were sterilized under enhanced UV-B. These results support the hypothesis that heightened UV-B stress could have contributed not only to pollen malformation production but also to deforestation during Permian-Triassic crisis intervals. By reducing the fertility of several widespread gymnosperm lineages, pulsed ozone shield weakening could have induced repeated terrestrial biosphere destabilization and food web collapse without exerting a direct “kill” mechanism on land plants or animals. These findings challenge the paradigm that mass extinctions require kill mechanisms and suggest that modern conifer forests may be considerably more vulnerable to anthropogenic ozone layer depletion than expected.},

Here we present a high-resolution $\delta$13Ccarb chemostratigraphic framework from latest Guadalupian to earliest Triassic time, calibrated with high-resolution conodont biostratigraphy and high-precision geochronology. We observe two large negative excursions in $\delta$13Ccarb, the first in uppermost Guadalupian strata and the second at the end of the Changhsingian stage, and between these events distinctive excursions from the middle Wuchiapingian to the early Changhsingian. The end-Changhsingian excursion represents a major reorganization of the global carbon cycle associated with the end-Permian mass extinction. However, the extent to which the end-Guadalupian and Wuchiapingian/Changhsingian boundary excursions result from local versus global controls remains unresolved. Regardless of their underlying causes, these three excursions provide chemostratigraphic markers for global correlation of Lopingian strata. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {General characteristics Orthophosphate compounds of the type A(PO4) include the minerals monazite [RE(PO4) with RE = the light rare-earth ions, e.g., La, Ce, Nd{\ldots}], xenotime [Y(PO4), and also incorporating the heavy RE ions], and pretulite [Sc(PO4)]. The name of the mineral monazite is derived from the Greek word monazein, “to be solitary,” whereas that of xenotime is derived from the Greek words xenos, meaning “foreign” and time, meaning “honor.” The mineral pretulite is named for Pretul Mountain, located in the Fischbacher Alps in Styria, Austria where the mineral was discovered (Bernhard et al. 1998). Pretulite is only the sixth mineral to have been found in which scandium is a major constituent. The anhydrous rare-earth (RE) orthophosphates can be structurally divided between the light RE-element compounds with the monoclinic monazite structure (space group P21/n, Z = 4) and the heavier RE compounds with the tetragonal (zircon-type) xenotime structure (space group I41/amd, Z = 4). In terms of the crystal chemistry of these two groups of compounds, a primary distinguishing structural feature is the coordination of the RE, Y, or Sc ions. In the monoclinic monazite structure, the RE ion is located in a polyhedron in which it is coordinated with nine oxygen ions. In the tetragonal xenotime structure, the heavier REs, Y, or Sc are located in a polyhedron in which they are coordinated with eight oxygen ions. Scandium orthophosphate is the basic constituent of the recently identified mineral, pretulite, which belongs to the orthophosphate group with the tetragonal xenotime structure (Bernhard et al. 1998). Both monazite and xenotime are relatively widely distributed as microcrystalline (or small crystalline) accessory inclusions in granitic rocks, rhyolites, pegmatites, and gneisses. Monazite also occurs in carbonatites, charnockites, migmatites, and {\ldots}},

Here, we report the effects of increased CO2 concentration on the early development of the sea urchins Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus and Echinometra mathaei. We examined the fertilization, early cleavage, and pluteus larval stage to evaluate the impact of elevated CO 2 concentration on fertilization rate, cleavage rate, developmental speed, and pluteus larval morphology. Furthermore, we compared the effects of CO2 and HCl at the same pH in an attempt to elucidate any differences between the two. We found that fertilization rate, cleavage rate, developmental speed, and pluteus larval size all tended to decrease with increasing CO 2 concentration. Furthermore, CO2-seawater had a more severe effect than HCl-seawater on the fertilization rate. By contrast, the effects on cleavage rate, developmental speed, and pluteus larval morphology were similar for CO2- and HCl-seawater. Our results suggest that both decreased pH and altered carbonate chemistry affect the early development and life history of marine animals, implying that increased seawater CO2 concentration will seriously alter marine ecosystems. The effects of CO 2 itself on marine organisms therefore requires further clarification.},

abstract = {Climate variability is driven by a complex interplay of global-scale processes and our understanding of them depends on sufficient temporal resolution of the geologic records and their precise inter-regional correlation, which in most cases cannot be obtained with biostratigraphic methods alone. Chemostratigraphic correlation based on bulk sediment carbon isotopes is increasingly used to facilitate high-resolution correlation over large distances, but complications arise from a multitude of possible influences from local differences in biological, diagenetic and physico-chemical factors on individual $\delta$13C records that can mask the global signal. To better assess the global versus local contribution in a $\delta$13C record it is necessary to compare numerous isotopic records on a global scale. As a contribution to this objective, this paper reviews bulk sediment $\delta$13Ccarb records from the Late Cretaceous in order to identify differences and similarities in secular $\delta$13C trends that help establish a global reference $\delta$13C record for this period. The study presents a global-scale comparison of twenty $\delta$13C records from sections representing various palaeo-latitudes in both hemispheres and different oceanic settings from the Boreal, Tethys, Western Interior, Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean, and with various diagenetic overprinting. The isotopic patterns are correlated based on independent dating with biostratigraphic and paleomagnetic data and reveal good agreement of the major isotope events despite offsets in absolute $\delta$13C values and variation in amplitude between the sites. These differences reflect the varying local influences e.g. from depositional settings, bottom water age and diagenetic history, whereas the concordant patterns in $\delta$13C shifts might represent $\delta$13C fluctuations in the global seawater dissolved inorganic carbon. The latter is modulated by variations in organic matter burial relative to re-mineralization, in the global-scale formation of authigenic carbonate, and in partitioning of carbon between organic carbon and carbonate sinks. These variations are mainly controlled by changes in climate and eustasy. Additionally, some globally synchronous shifts in the bulk $\delta$13Ccarb records could result from parallel variation in the contribution of authigenic carbonate to the sediment. Formation of these cements through biologically mediated early diagenetic processes is related to availability of oxygen and organic material and, thus, can be globally synchronized by fluctuations in eustasy, atmospheric and oceanic oxygen levels or in large-scale oceanic circulation. Because the influence of early diagenetic cements on the bulk $\delta$13Ccarb signal can, but need not be synchronized, chemostratigraphy should not be used as a stand-alone method for trans-continental correlation, and especially minor isotopic shifts have to be interpreted with utmost care. Nevertheless, the observed consistency of the $\delta$13C correlations confirms global scale applicability of bulk sediment $\delta$13C chemostratigraphy for the Late Cretaceous, including sediments that underwent lithification and burial diagenesis such as the sediments from the Himalayan and Alpine sections. Limitations arise from increased uncertainties (1) in sediments with very low carbonate content, (2) from larger $\delta$13C variability in sediments from very shallow marine environments, (3) from unrecognized hiatuses or strong changes in sedimentation rates, and (4) in sections with short stratigraphic coverage or with few biostratigraphic marker horizons.The combination of chemostratigraphy with biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy substantially increases the precision and temporal resolution of inter-regional correlations and helps overcome problems that arise from differences in biostratigraphic schemes, facies or provincialism of key fossils. By using an iterative approach to stepwise increase precision of the correlations, isochroneity of first and last occurrences of marker species versus chemostratigraphy is tested, which helps to improve biostratigraphic zonations, to assess zonal boundary ages and to identify useful criteria for defining Late Cretaceous stage boundaries, many of which are still not formally defined. The presented correlations indicate a consistent position for most planktic foraminifer zonal boundaries relative to corresponding isotope shifts during the mid-Cretaceous sea-level high, whereas diachroneity appears to be more pronounced during the Late Campanian and Maastrichtian global sea-level fall. A similar pattern is observed for trans-continental consistency in the $\delta$13C shifts. Graphic correlation of isotopic shifts, magnetostratigraphic and biostratigraphic events among the compared sections is used to detect hiatuses or relative changes sediment accumulation rates and visualizes consistency or offsets of individual biostratigraphic markers relative to chemo- and magnetostratigraphy. Finally, an attempt of a global average $\delta$13C stack is presented for the Turonian through Maastrichtian. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

It was formed during the main step of a very rapid and large-scale platform flooding (Earliest Triassic) and has been found also in other Tethyan localities. This calcimicrobial cap rock, 20 to 40 m thick, consists of thrombolitic and stromatolitic build-ups at the base and most oolitic grainstone in the upper part. It was terminated by a sudden input of fine terrigenous sediments. The domal, columnar and conical stromatolites are ‘anachronistic' deposits as are the abundant botryoidal and fanning aragonite crystal pseudomorphs. This again shows the uniqueness of the Earliest Triassic period and indicates a delayed biotic recovery. To cite this article: A. Baud et al., C. R. Palevol 4 (2005). },

abstract = {The 'long-lasted anoxia' of a deep ocean bottom which may be related to the Permian-Triassic (PT) mass extinction event has been accepted without critical evidence. The degree of bioturbation is examined for radiolarian chert successions in central Japan with the reassessment of geochemical proxies to evaluate the degree of palaeo-oxygenation of a pelagic oceanic bottom. No evidence for anoxia is found from Wuchiapingian and lower Changhsingian chert by the reassessment of geochemical proxies. Anoxia started from the late Changhsingian stage that was interrupted by an oxygenation event at the supposed PT boundary. Griesbachian to the earliest Smithian, being characterised by the occurrence of black carbonaceous claystone, is an anoxic interval with rare bioturbation in the early part and is oxygenated in the later part. Succeeding grey siliceous claystone of early Smithian represents largely an anoxic interval, but it is oxygenated in the later part of this stage. Grey siliceous claystone with black carbonaceous claystone interbeds of Spathian was suboxic to oxic, and temporal anoxia being caused mainly by high productivity intermittently was established within a short time interval. Red chert is rather common in Anisian, but unusual sedimentation of organic matter still continued until the latest Anisian. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Presented is a simple non-destructive method for quantifying conodont colour based on digital processing of conodont images taken by a digital camera attached to a binocular microscope operating under incident light, using the RGB colour space. The digital colour data was calibrated to a spectral reflectance of the standard colour background. The results from theMoravo-Silesian Zone (MSZ) of the Bohemian Massif, Czech Republic, demonstrate an excellent relationship existing between the digital intensities of the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) colours and CAI in the range from CAI 3 to CAI 6. The R/B colour ratio proved the best proxy of CAI. The R/B ratio decreases with increasing CAI from values {\textgreater}1.6 (CAI3) to {\~{}}1.0 (CAI5) and then slightly increases to 1.15 (mean for CAI5.5) and 1.26 (mean for CAI6). It is closely related to CAI (R2 = 0.8974) within CAI 3 to CAI 5 interval. The R/B ratio is similar in concept to the slope of the reflectance curve obtained from the spectral reflectance of conodonts by previous authors, as well as to the shift from yellow and brown colours towards greyscale conodont colours with increasing thermal maturation according to the original definition of CAI. Regional distribution of the CAI and R/B ratio from the MSZ suggests that the digital conodont colour data is closely related to vitrinite reflectance and illite crystallinity data.},

abstract = {The concentrations of many natural compounds are altered by chemical and biological transformations, and physical processes such as adsorption and transport. Their fate can be predicted using reactive transport models that describe reaction and advective and dispersive movement of these components in their natural environment. Recently a number of software packages have been implemented in the open source software R that allow one to implement reactive transport models. Central to this is the ReacTran R-package, a comprehensive collection of functions for modeling reactive components that may be distributed over multiple phases, whose dynamics are coupled through biological and geochemical reactions, and that are transported in one-, two- or three-dimensional domains with simple geometries. Dedicated solution methods are in R-packages deSolve and rootSolve. The modeling packages facilitate the simulation of reaction and transport of components for spatial scales ranging from micrometers to kilometers and spanning multiple time-scales. As they are influenced in similar ways, the same functions can solve biogeochemical models of the sediment, groundwater, rivers, estuaries, lakes or water columns, experimental setups, or even describe reaction and transport within flat, cylindrical or spherical bodies, such as organisms, aggregates, or the dispersion of individuals on flat surfaces and so on. We illustrate the use of R for reactive transport modeling by three applications spanning several orders of magnitude with respect to spatial and temporal scales. They comprise (1) a model of an experimental flow-through sediment reactor, where fitting so-called breakthrough curves are used to derive sulfate reduction rates in an estuarine sediment, (2) a conservative and reactive tracer addition experiment in a small stream, which implements the concept of river spiraling, and (3) a 2-D and 3-D model that describes oxygen dynamics in the upper layers of the sediment, interspersed with several hotspots of increased reaction intensities. The packages ReacTran, deSolve and rootSolve are implemented in the software R and thus available for all popular platforms (Linux, Windows, Mac). Models implemented using this software are short and easily readable, yet they are efficiently solved. This makes R extremely well suited for rapid model prototyping. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Atmospheric CO2 concentrations appear to have been considerably higher than modern levels during much of the Phanerozoic and it has hence been proposed that surface temperatures were also higher. Some studies have, however, suggested that Earth's temperature (estimated from the isotopic composition of fossil shells) may have been independent of variations in atmospheric CO2 (e.g. in the Jurassic and Cretaceous). If large changes in atmospheric CO2 did not produce the expected climate responses in the past, predictions of future climate and the case for reducing current fossil-fuel emissions are potentially undermined. Here we evaluate the dataset upon which the Jurassic and Cretaceous assertions are based and present new temperature data, derived from the isotopic composition of fossil brachiopods. Our results are consistent with a warm climate mode for the Jurassic and Cretaceous and hence support the view that changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are linked with changes in global temperatures.},

abstract = {Microbial experiments are the only proven approach to produce experimental dolomite under Earth's surface conditions. Although microbial metabolisms are known to induce dolomite precipitation by favoring dolomite growth kinetics, the involvement of microbes in the dolomite nucleation process is poorly understood. In particular, the nucleation of microbially mediated dolomite remains a matter for investigation because the metabolic diversity involved in this process has not been fully explored. Herein we demonstrate that Halomonas meridiana and Virgibacillus marismortui, two moderately halophilic aerobic bacteria, mediate primary precipitation of dolomite at low temperatures (25, 35 {\{}degrees{\}}C). This report emphasizes the biomineralogical implications for dolomite formation at the nanometer scale. We describe nucleation of dolomite on nanoglobules in intimate association with the bacterial cell surface. A combination of both laboratory culture experiments and natural samples reveals that these nanoglobule structures may be: (1) the initial step for dolomite nucleation, (2) preserved in the geologic record, and (3) used as microbial tracers through time and/or as a proxy for ancient microbial dolomite, as well as other carbonate minerals.},

abstract = {Genomes contain evidence for the history of life and furthermore contain evidence for lateral gene transfer, which was an important part of that history. The geological record also contains evidence for the history of life, and newer findings indicates that the Earth's oceans were largely anoxic and highly sulfidic up until about 0.6 billion years ago. Eukaryotes, which fossil data indicate to have been in existence for at least 1.5 billion years, must have therefore spent much of their evolutionary history in oxygen-poor and sulfide-rich environments. Many eukaryotes still inhabit such environments today. Among eukaryotes, organelles also contain evidence for the history of life and have preserved abundant traces of their anaerobic past in the form of energy metabolic pathways. New views of eukaryote phylogeny suggest that fungi may be among the earliest-branching eukaryotes. From the standpoint of the fungal feeding habit (osmotrophy rather than phagotrophy) and from the standpoint of the diversity in their ATP-producing pathways, a eukaryotic tree with fungi first would make sense. Because of lateral gene transfer and endosymbiosis, branches in the tree of genomes intermingle and occasionally fuse, but the overall contours of cell history nonetheless seem sketchable and roughly correlateable with geological time.},

abstract = {The Ediacaran Period was a critical time in the history of life and Earth. Understanding the complex interactions between geological and biological events during this interval requires high-resolution chronostratigraphy. Thanks to its uniquely favorable palaeogeographic setting, South China is an ideal region for constructing a framework for global chronostratigraphic correlation of Ediacaran strata. Here, continuous Ediacaran successions contain both siliciclastic and carbonate rocks that range from shallow to deep marine and contain rich fossil assemblages showing a variety of preservation styles. As part of the present study, 62 reference sections distributed throughout the Yangtze Platform were investigated. Analyses of the sedimentary facies and sequence stratigraphy of more than 40 sections revealed four major sequences in the shallow marine facies. Three major sequence boundaries occur respectively in the middle and upper parts of the Doushantuo Formation and in the middle part of the Dengying Formation. Subdivision and correlation of the Ediacaran successions of the Yangtze Platform based on sequence stratigraphy is congruent with the carbon isotope chemostratigraphy of 12 reference sections (1075 samples). The sequence boundary (SB2) in the middle part of the Doushantuo Formation is suggested here as the Lower (Xiadongian)/Upper (Yangtzean) series boundary of the Ediacaran which coincides with several globally recognizable events, namely 1) the end of the Neoproterozoic glaciations, 2) the first appearance of animals, 3) the sudden increase in the diversity of acanthomorphic acritarchs, and 4) a negative $\delta$13C excursion. The Ediacaran System of South China may be subdivided into five stages. Furthermore, the criteria for defining these stages may be applicable throughout the world. Also, the composite carbon isotope profile of the Ediacaran of South China can be used as a global reference for chronostratigraphic subdivision and correlation. In addition to the globally recognizable, negative $\delta$13C excursion in the cap carbonate at the base of the Ediacaran, the negative $\delta$13C excursion in the uppermost Doushantuo/Wonoka/Shuram interval represents another, globally correlatable major excursion. The positive $\delta$13C excursion immediately following the uppermost Doushantuo excursion and ending at 548 Ma is also useful for global correlation. Current Ediacaran chronostratigraphy and global correlations indicate that the upper Doushantuo/Wonoka/Shuram negative $\delta$13C excursion ranges from ca. 560 Ma to 551 Ma, and therefore coincides with the evolutionary renovation of life. Feedback between evolutionary innovation and geochemical cycling was the key mechanism for this unique and most strongly negative $\delta$13C excursion in earth history. Our chronostratigraphic correlations also imply that the earliest known metazoan biotas, namely the Weng'an and characteristic Ediacaran biotas, do not constitute two temporally separate evolutionary lineages, as proposed previously, but represent two parallel evolutionary pathways preceding the Cambrian explosion of animal life. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The foraminiferal faunas and biostratigraphic correlation of the Tethyan uppermost Permian (Dzhulfian and Dorashamian) provide important paleogeographic and tectonic data for the interpretation of the Palaeofusulina-bearing terranes in East and Southeast Asia. These interpretations have a significant bearing on understanding Japanese pre-Cretaceous tectonostratigraphic and micropaleontologic data, as well as the geodynamic evolution of the Japanese Palaeofusulina-bearing terranes. The Tethyan foraminiferal fauna in the uppermost Permian is characterized by the occurrence of provincial and endemic schubertellid genera, and the absence of neoschwagerinids and verbeekinids which had characterized the rapidly evolving Middle Permian Tethyan marine faunas until their extinction at the end of the Midian. Difficulties in world-wide correlation of the uppermost Permian have resulted because of different geographic faunal compositions and the geographic patterns of extinction of Permian marine faunas. The Palaeofusulina fauna is one of the most reliable indicators of the uppermost Permian. Its presence or absence serves as paleogeographic constraints on East and Southeast Asian terranes. For example, the absence of Palaeofusulina fauna and the presence of late Midian Lepidolina multiseptata faunas in the Lhasa Terrane in Tibet and the Wolya Terrane in Sumatra (the third continental sliver north of Gondwana) are important, particularly, for identifying the rift–drift–collision process of the Gondwana-affinity terranes. They suggest a Late Permian separation of the two terranes from Gondwana. Tethyan Palaeofusulina occur in the latest Permian tropical to subtropical latitudinal belt and along with other geologic data assist in paleogeographic reconstructions and in interpreting the possible movement and emplacement of the Palaeofusulina-bearing terranes such as the Maizuru, South Kitakami–Kurosegawa and Chichibu terranes in Japan. They reveal that: (1) the Upper Permian Maizuru Group was deposited on the eastern continental margin of South China; (2) the occurrence of the Lower Permian Cathaysian flora and a number of geologic data in the South Kitakami–Kurosegawa suggest an arc–trench system setting and the Late Permian deposition in a shallow open-marine environment in proximity to South China; (3) foraminiferal biogeograpic data and the reconstructed oceanic plate stratigraphy in the Chichibu Terrane constrain the location of the Chichibu Seamount Chains to the western part of the Panthalassan domain, as they moved westwards against the Cathaysian Continent until their Jurassic accretion.},

abstract = {Different pathways can be proposed to explain the origin of the red pigmentation present in many Phanerozoic limestones. We investigate three possible models: (1) telogenetic alteration; (2) detrital input and (3) role of iron-bacteria. The third hypothesis is supported by our data for a number of Phanerozoic series. By this hypothesis not only can we highlight the importance of the microenvironments at the dysoxicanoxic water sediment interfaces for the bacterial Fe-oxidation but also can conclude that the red limestones have no particular paleogeographic meaning. The seven studied red successions are rather poor in iron (350 ppm in the Ammonitico Rosso) without large fluctuations. The pigmentation is due to the dispersion of submicrometric (hydro)oxides (now hematite) formed by bacterial mediation during early diagenesis in various microaerophilitic environments. Different ferruginous morphs, e.g., filaments, coccoids, microstromatolites, suggest the presence of iron-bacteria. The limiting factor is the oxygen content which was low in these very quiet and relatively deep environments. The presence of iron-bacteria is also confirmed by iron isotope analysis on the Ammonitico Rosso. Fe isotopic compositions have been analyzed on residues as well as on leachates of red and grey facies of the same interval. d56Fe values are systematically lower in the red residues (varying from - 1.19 to - 0.34) compared to the grey ones (0.27 to - 0.09). This indicates a significant accumulation of lighter isotopes in the red parts suggesting that hematite have been formed via a biological pathway.},

The framboids are abundant in the thin pyrite lamina on the top of Bed 24e (the upper layer of Bed 24), and Beds 25, 26 and 29, rare in Bed 24e and Bed 28, but absent in Bed 27. They have narrow size distributions with average diameters from 4.6????m to 8.7????m which are similar to those formed under anoxic/dysoxic conditions. The abundances and mean diameters of the pyrite framboids indicate redox conditions of deposition changing from upper dysoxia (Bed 24e) and lower dysoxia (pyrite lamina, Beds 25 and 26) to oxygenation (Bed 27), and again to upper dysoxia (Bed 28) and lower dysoxia (Bed 29).

abstract = {The geological cycling of carbon ties together the ocean-atmosphere carbon pool, Earth's biosphere, and Earth's sedimentary reservoirs. Perturbations to this coupled system are recorded in the carbon-isotopic ( 13C) composition of marine carbonates. Large amplitude 13C excursions are typically treated as individual events and interpreted accordingly. However, a recent compilation of Phanerozoic carbon isotopic data reveals that 13C excursions are a ubiquitous feature of the geologic record, and thus should be considered in concert. Analysis indicates that Phanerozoic carbon isotope excursions, as a whole, have characteristic durations of 0.5 to 10 M.yr. and exhibit declining amplitude over time. These commonalities suggest a shared underlying control. Here we demonstrate that sinusoidal modulation of the sensitivity of organic carbon and phosphate burial in a simple numerical model of the geologic carbon cycle results in large, asymmetric 13C oscillations that exhibit their largest amplitudes in the 0.5 to 10 M.yr. period range. As anoxia is known to strongly modulate the C:P burial ratio of organic matter in sediments, we propose that sea-level oscillations were the primary source of sinusoidal modulation for the geologic carbon cycle, and that their degree of influence on the carbon cycle was determined by the state of oxygenation of bottom waters overlying the continental shelves. When oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) were large, shallow, and prone to expansion, sea-level changes would have had the capacity to drive large changes in the areal extent of OMZs in contact with the sea-floor, resulting in strong leverage on the burial sensitivity of organic carbon and phosphate, and thus on 13C. Progressive oxygenation of the oceans, which was facilitated by biological innovations, resulted in a decline in the amplitude of 13C excursions over the Phanerozoic, and the biogeochemical stabilization of the Earth System.},

abstract = {Although mass extinctions probably account for the disappearance of less than 5{\%} of all extinct species, the evolutionary opportunities they have created have had a disproportionate effect on the history of life. Theoretical considerations and simulations have suggested that the empty niches created by a mass extinction should refill rapidly after extinction ameliorates. Under logistic models, this biotic rebound should be exponential, slowing as the environmental carrying capacity is approached. Empirical studies reveal a more complex dynamic, including positive feedback and an exponential growth phase during recoveries. Far from a model of refilling ecospace, mass extinctions appear to cause a collapse of ecospace, which must be rebuilt during recovery. Other generalities include the absence of a clear correlation between the magnitude of extinction and the pace of recovery or the resulting ecological and evolutionary disruption the presence of a survival interval, with few originations, immediately after an extinction and preceding the recovery phase, and the presence of many lineages that persist through an extinction event only to disappear during the subsequent recovery. Several recoveries include numerous missing lineages, groups that are found before the extinction, then latter in the recovery, but are missing during the initial survival–recovery phase. The limited biogeographic studies of recoveries suggest considerable variability between regions.},

abstract = {We report the sulfur and oxygen isotope composition of sulfate (??34SSO4 and ??18OSO4, respectively) in coexisting barite and carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), which we use to explore temporal variability in the marine sulfur cycle through the middle Cretaceous. The ??34SSO4 of marine barite tracks previously reported sulfur isotope data from the tropical Pacific. The ??18OSO4 of marine barite exhibits more rapid and larger isotopic excursions than the ??34SSO4 of marine barite; these excursions temporally coincide with Ocean Anoxic Events (OAEs). Neither the ??34SSO4 nor the ??18OSO4 measured in marine barite resembles the ??34SSO4 or the ??18OSO4 measured in coexisting CAS. Culling our data set for elemental parameters suggestive of carbonate recrystallization (low [Sr] and high Mn/Sr) improves our record of ??18OSO4 in CAS in the Cretaceous. This suggests that the CAS proxy can be impacted by carbonate recrystallization in some marine sediments. A box model is used to explore the response of the ??34SSO4 and ??18OSO4 to different perturbations in the marine biogeochemical sulfur cycle. We conclude that the ??34SSO4 in the middle Cretaceous is likely responding to a change in the isotopic composition of pyrite being buried, coupled possibly with a change in riverine input. On the other hand, the ??18OSO4 is likely responding to rapid changes in the reoxidation pathway of sulfide, which we suggest may be due to anoxic versus euxinic conditions during different OAEs. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

By incorporating independently available biochemical data, the model can reproduce a large number of recent experimental fractionation measurements with only three free parameters: (i) the sulfur isotope selectivity of sulfate uptake into the cytoplasm, (ii) the ratio of reduced to oxidized electron carriers supporting the respiration pathway, and (iii) the ratio of in vitro to in vivo levels of respiratory enzyme activity. Fractionation is influenced by all steps in the dissimilatory pathway, which means that environmental sulfate and sulfide levels control sulfur isotope fractionation through the proximate influence of intracellular metabolites. Although sulfur isotope fractionation is a phenotypic trait that appears to be strain specific, we show that it converges on near-thermodynamic behavior, even at micromolar sulfate levels, as long as intracellular sulfate reduction rates are low enough ({\textless}1 fmol H2S⋅cell(-1)⋅d(-1)).},

abstract = {A distinct Pliocene eastern Mediterranean sapropel (i-282), recovered from three Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 160 Sites, has been investigated for its organic and inorganic composition. This sapropel is characterized by high organic carbon (C-org) and trace element contents, and the presence of isorenieratene derivatives. The latter suggests that the base of the photic zone was sulphidic during formation of the sapropel. Combined with evidence of bottom water anoxia (preservation of laminae, high redox-sensitive trace element contents, and the abundance and isotopic composition of pyrite) this leads to the tentative conclusion that almost the entire water column may have been anoxic. This anoxia resulted from high productivity and not from stagnation, because an approximation of the trace element budget during sapropel formation shows that water exchange with the western Mediterranean is needed. Entire water column anoxia has been suggested earlier for several black shales. With regard to the depositional environment and the C-org content, however, only the Cenomanian/Turonian Boundary Event (CTBE) black shales appear to be comparable to this sapropel. The proposed trace element removal mechanism of scavenging and (co-)precipitation in an anoxic water column, is thought to be similar for both types of deposits. The ultimate trace element source for the sapropel, however, is seawater, whereas it is hydrothermal and fluvial input for CTBE black shales (because they have a larger temporal and spatial distribution). Nonetheless, the C-org-rich eastern Mediterranean Pliocene sapropel discussed here may be considered to be a younger analogue of CTBE black shales. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We critically evaluate potential policy-relevant tipping elements in the climate system under anthropogenic forcing, drawing on the pertinent literature and a recent international workshop to compile a short list, and we assess where their tipping points lie. An expert elicitation is used to help rank their sensitivity to global warming and the uncertainty about the underlying physical mechanisms. Then we explain how, in principle, early warning systems could be established to detect the proximity of some tipping points. Earth system tipping points climate change large-scale impacts climate policy},

abstract = {We report measurements of seasonal variability in the C-N stable isotope ratios of plants collected across the habitat mosaic of San Francisco Bay, its marshes, and its tributary river system. Analyses of 868 plant samples were binned into 10 groups (e.g., terrestrial riparian, freshwater phytoplankton, salt marsh) to determine whether C-N isotopes can be used as biomarkers for tracing the origins of organic matter in this river-marsh-estuary complex. Variability of delta(130)C and delta(15)N was high (similar to5-10parts per thousand) within each plant group, and we identified three modes of variability: (1) between species and their microhabitats, (2) over annual cycles of plant growth and senescence, and (3) between living and decomposing biomass. These modes of within-group variability obscure any source-specific isotopic signatures, confounding the application of C-N isotopes for identifying the origins of organic matter. A second confounding factor was large dissimilarity between the delta(13)C-delta(15)N of primary producers and the organic-matter pools in the seston and sediments. Both confounding factors impede the application of C-N isotopes to reveal the food supply to primary consumers in ecosystems supporting diverse autotrophs and where the isotopic composition of organic matter has been transformed and become distinct from that of its parent plant sources. Our results support the advice of others: variability of C-N stable isotopes within all organic-matter pools is high and must be considered in applications of these isotopes to trace trophic linkages from primary producers to primary consumers. Isotope-based approaches are perhaps most powerful when used to complement other tools, such as molecular biomarkers, bioassays, direct measures of production, and compilations of organic-matter budgets},

High-resolution correlation of Kuhjoch, the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Jurassic, Hochalplgraben and Tiefengraben shows that the initial and main Carbon Isotope Excursions (CIE) are contemporaneous with first and last occurrences of boundary defining macro- and microfossils. We focus on the end-Triassic initial CIE at the transition from the limestones of the K{\"{o}}ssen Formation to the marls of the Kendlbach Formation. This change coincides with a dramatically increased influx of conifer (Cheirolepidiaceae) pollen and increased total organic carbon (TOC) values, succeeded by an acme of green algae (Cymatiosphaera). We present a model in which increased terrestrial organic matter influx is related to enhanced seasonality and increased erosion of the hinterland. Reduced salinity of the surface waters led to the mass occurrence of green algae. Stratification of the water column may have caused anoxic bottom water conditions and black shale deposition during the initial CIE at the base of the Kendlbach Fm.},

Fossil molecular (biomarker) and nitrogen isotopic records from a sedimentary sequence in western Canada provide the first conclusive evidence of PZE and disrupted biogeochemistry in neritic waters of the Panthalassic Ocean during the end Triassic.

Here it is shown that approximately 80 percent of the underlying tree of life can survive even when approximately 95 percent of species are lost, and that algorithms that maximize the amount of evolutionary history preserved are not much better than choosing the survivors at random. Given the political, economic, and social realities constraining conservation biology, these findings may be helpful.},

The presence of a metabolizing cell on a mineral substrate has a significant effect on the mineral texture and on the geochemistry of the surrounding microenvironment. In nature, microorganisms exist in microbial communities as mats or biofilms growing upon a solid substrate. As such they cover a vast surface area both within and below the surface of Earth's land and sea.

abstract = {Temnospondyls are a group of basal tetrapods that existed from the Early Carboniferous to the Early Cretaceous. They were characteristic members of Permian and Triassic continental faunas around the globe. Only one clade, the Brachyopoidea (Brachyopidae and Chigutisauridae), is found as relics in the Jurassic of eastern Asia and the Cretaceous of Australia. The other Late Triassic clades, such as Plagiosauridae, Metoposauridae, and Cyclotsauridae, are generally believed to have gone extinct gradually before the end of the Triassic and putative Rhaetian records are stratigraphically poorly constrained. Temnospondyl humeri all show a similar morphological pattern, being stout, short, with widened ends, and with a typical torsion between the proximal and distal heads. Based on these characters, a humerus found in a Rhaetic-type bonebed in unequivocally Rhaetian sediments (marine Exter Formation) in a clay pit at Bonenburg (eastern Westphalia, Germany) was identified as pertaining to the temnospondyl cf. Cyclotosaurus sp. The humeral midshaft histology also supports temnospondyl affinities and serves to exclude plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs from consideration. This find is the geologically youngest record of a non-brachyopoid temnospondyl, indicating that cyclotosaurids survived well into the Rhaetian, likely falling victim to the end-Triassic extinction.},

abstract = {Detailed examination of the test morphology, organic layers and microstructure of G. menardii (d'Orbigny) elucidated the mode of wall construction and chamber formation. The organic layers and matrix within the test probably play an important role in the calcification process. Calcification of a new chamber wall probably starts with the secretion of 2 calcite layers on either side of the primary organic membrane (POM). These calcite layers are bounded by inner and outer organic layers formed by the inner and outer cytoplasm, respectively. Additional calcite layers are secreted between successive organic layers. The calcite layers including the calcite crust on the distal side of the POM are thicker than those on the proximal side. An inner organic lining (IOL) is the last organic layer to be formed on the inner test surface and grows thicker with age. It serves as a protective lining and may or may not aid in calcite secretion. The incipient wall may be completely calcified while still lacking pores. Numerous micropores are subsequently developed by partial resorption of the calcified wall in regions where regular pores will be formed. The pores are initially irregular in outline and occur over the entire chamber surface including the keel. Surface ridges probably reflect the direction of protoplasmic streaming on the test surface and pustules may be anchoring points for rhizopodia.},

In order to address this problem, hard tissue histology is reviewed paying particular attention to the relationships during growth of the component hard tissues comprising conodont elements, and ignoring a priori assumptions of the homologies of these tissues. Conodont element growth is considered further in terms of the pattern of formation, of which four distinct types are described, all possibly derived from a primitive condition after heterochronic changes in the timing of various developmental stages. It is hoped that this may provide further means of unravelling conodont phylogeny. The manner in which the tissues grew is considered homologous with other vertebrate hard tissues, and the elements appear to have grown in a way similar to the growing scales and growing dentition of other vertebrates.},

abstract = {The end-Ordovician extinction consisted of two discrete pulses, both linked, in various ways, to glaciation at the South Pole. The first phase, starting just below the Normalograptus extraordinarius Zone, particularly affected nektonic and planktonic species, while the second pulse, associated with the Normalograptus persculptus Zone, was less selective. Glacially induced cooling and oxygenation are two of many suggested kill mechanisms for the end-Ordovician extinction, but a general consensus is lacking. We have used geochemical redox indicators, such as iron speciation, molybdenum concentrations, pyrite framboid size distribution and sulfur isotopes to analyze the geochemistry in three key Hirnantian sections. These indicators reveal that reducing conditions were occasionally present at all three sites before the first pulse of the end-Ordovician extinction, and that these conditions expanded towards the second pulse. Even though the N. extraordinarius Zone appears to have been a time of oxygenated deposition, pyrite is significantly enriched in 34S in our sections as well as in sections reported from South China. This suggests a widespread reduction in marine sulfate concentrations, which we attribute to an increase in pyrite burial during the early Hirnantian. The S-isotope excursion coincides with a major positive carbon isotope excursion indicating elevated rates of organic carbon burial as well. We argue that euxinic conditions prevailed and intensified in the early Hirnantian oceans, and that a concomitant global sea level lowering pushed the chemocline deeper than the depositional setting of our sites. In the N. persculptus Zone, an interval associated with a major sea level rise, our redox indicators suggests that euxinic conditions, and ferruginous in some places, encroached onto the continental shelves. In our model, the expansion of euxinic conditions during the N. extraordinarius Zone was generated by a reorganization of nutrient cycling during sea level fall, and we argue, overall, that these dynamics in ocean chemistry played an important role for the end-Ordovician mass extinction. During the first pulse of the extinction, euxinia and a steepened oxygen gradient in the water column caused habitat loss for deep-water benthic and nektonic organisms. During the second pulse, the transgression of anoxic water onto the continental shelves caused extinction in shallower habitats. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Barents Sea is considered as an important target for oil and gas exploration, but the petroleum potential of its shelf and slope regions is unknown. Here we present results of a research cruise to the Northern Hinlopen Margin at the transition to the Southern Nansen Basin and the Eastern Yermak Plateau. Multichannel reflection seismic data acquisition, heat flow measurements, and geochemical analyses of near-surface sediments obtained by gravity coring were conducted to study the northern Barents Sea shelf and the early opening of the Nansen Basin and decipher their petroleum potential. Seismic data indicate high thicknesses of up to {\~{}}2000 m of Cenozoic sediments. Heat flow density values in the study area range between 67 and 108 mW/m2. The sediment samples were analysed for bulk geochemistry and sorbed hydrocarbon gases and for two sites for extractable hydrocarbons. Data from extractable (n-alkanes {\textgreater} n-C25) and bulk (HI and OI from Rock Eval) organic matter demonstrate predominantly terrigenous organic material, most likely derived from ice-transported allochthonous sediments. None of the sediments revealed substantial amounts of methane in pore waters, arguing against active hydrocarbon seepage in the studied areas. However, thermogenic gases sorbed to the sediment matrix (clay minerals, organic matter and/or carbonates) were found in concentrations of up to 600 ppb (on sediment wet wt. basis). For the samples from the Northern Hinlopen Margin and particularly from the adjacent Nansen Basin, a paleo fluid flow of thermogenic gas is indicated and accompanied by higher n-alkanes with a modal, petroleum-like distribution. $\delta$13C values of methane, ethane and propane and gas compositions point at a mainly marine source rock origin of all studied gases with early oil window maturities of the associated rocks (0.6-0.9{\%}VR). From this data an admixture of Type III derived thermogenic gases is indicated for some of the Yermak Plateau sediments for which also the lowest abundances of sorbed gases (50-100 ppb) were observed. Gas geochemical characteristics in the samples with low gas abundances can partially be explained by an input of gases through ice-transport of allochthonous hydrocarbons, which were bound to mature organic matter. For a site on the Northern Hinlopen Margin NE of Svalbard, right at the southern termination of the Nansen Basin a different situation is indicated. In this area the highest concentrations of sorbed gases most likely derived from sediments with an early-oil window maturity and a marine kerogen Type II-typical isotopic distribution. At this location a pseudo well was constructed from 2D seismic data for reconstruction of thermal and maturity evolution. The simulation results indicate that an Early to Middle Eocene source rock would be in the early oil window since the Early Miocene. A possible source rock here and in the circum-Arctic region could have been formed by Azolla algae and other flourishing primary producers.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction greatly diminished marine diversity and brought about a whole-scale restructuring of marine ecosystems; these ecosystem changes also profoundly affected the sedimentary record. Data presented here, attained through facies analyses of strata deposited during the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction (southern Turkey) and at the close of the Early Triassic (southwestern United States), in combination with a literature review, show that sedimentary systems were profoundly affected by: (1) a reduction in biotic diversity and abundance and (2) long-term environmental fluctuations that resulted from the end-Permian crisis. Lower Triassic strata display widespread microbialite and carbonate seafloor fan development and contain indicators of suppressed infaunal bioturbation such as flat-pebble conglomerates and wrinkle structures (facies considered unusual in post-Cambrian subtidal deposits). Our observations suggest that depositional systems, too, respond to biotic crises, and that certain facies may act as barometers of ecologic and environmental change independent of fossil assemblage analyses. Close investigation of facies changes during other critical times in Earth history may serve as an important tool in interpreting the ecology of metazoans and their environment. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We present an empirical calibration of the carbonate clumped isotope thermometer based on mollusk and brachiopod shells from natural and controlled environments spanning water temperatures of −1.0 to 29.5°C. The clumped isotope data ($\Delta$47) are normalized to CO2 gases with equilibrium distributions of clumped isotopologues at high temperature (1000°C) and low temperature (27 or 30°C), and thus the calibration is unique in being directly referenced to a carbon dioxide equilibrium reference frame (Dennis et al., 2011, Defining an absolute reference frame for clumped isotope studies of CO2, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 75, 7117–7131). The shell clumped isotope data define the following relation as a function of temperature (in kelvin): $\Delta$47=0.0327×106/T2+0.3286(r2=0.84).The temperature sensitivity (slope) of this relation is lower than those based on corals, fish otoliths, foraminifera, and coccoliths, but is similar to theoretical predictions for calcite based on lattice dynamics calculations. We find no convincing methodological or biological explanations for the difference in temperature sensitivity between this calibration and the previous calibrations, and suggest that the discrepancy might represent real but unknown differences in mineral–DIC clumped isotope fractionation between mollusks/brachiopods and other taxa. Nevertheless, revised analytical methods similar to those used in this study are now in wide use, and it will be important to develop calibrations for other taxonomic groups using these updated methods, with analyses directly referenced to the carbon dioxide equilibrium reference frame.},

abstract = {Sequential leaching experiments were carried out on twenty-one hydrogenetic crust samples from different locations in the central Pacific and the results are compared with four crust and nodule samples of different genetic origin. Fe-vernadite ($\delta$-MnO2) is the most important minor and trace metal-bearing mineral phase and shows high concentrations of Co, Ni, Cd, TI, Ba, Zn, and Cu, which are present in seawater mainly as hydrated and labile complexed cations. Elements forming carbonate and hydroxide complexes and oxyanions in seawater like Pb, Mo, V, and minor proportions of Cu and Zn are bound in the Fe00H fraction. The Ca carbonate phase, and the residual fraction which consists of aluminosilicates and crystalline oxides, show only minor heavy metal associations, e.g., Cu and Zn. Only a small part of the high Ti concentrations in hydrogenetic crusts is of detrital origin; Ti mainly forms a hydrogenetic phase, probably consisting of Ti02 * 2H20 intergrown with the amorphous Fe00H phase. Analyses of different sample types and crust layers show that aging and diagenetic effects can change the phase associations of some elements. The most notable change was observed for Pb which, during phosphatization of crusts, is transferred from the MnFe oxide fraction to the apatite fraction. A colloid-chemical model for the hydrogenetic precipitation of ferromanganese crusts on seamounts is proposed. In the first stage, Mn2+-rich water from the oxygen minimum zone is mixed with oxygen-rich deep-water, and oxidized Mn(IV) and other metals like Fe, Ti, Al, and Si form oxide and hydroxide colloids. These form mixed colloidal phases and scavenge trace metals by sorptive processes which are dominated by coulombic and chemical interactions between colloid surfaces and dissolved metal species. In stage two, the colloidal phases precipitate on the substrate rocks of the seamounts as ferromanganese oxide encrustations, incorporating the sorbed heavy metals into the mineral phases. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Systematic sulfur isotope data for whole-rock sulfides have been obtained from the chert-dominated, continuous, pelagic sedimentary sequences spanning the Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary at Tenjinmaru in the Chichibu Terrane and at Sasayama in the Tanba Terrane in Japan. The P/Tr boundary is characterized by the occurrence of siliceous shales in association with a carbonaceous black mudstone which is similar in appearance to the worldwide distributed Cretaceous/Tertiary (K/T) boundary claystone. The observed data clearly demonstrate a significant bimodalism. The 34S/32S ratios with respect to CDT are generally low throughout the Middle Permian (ca.−39 to −25{\%}0) and show a remarkable increase beginning in the lower Upper Permian and persisting into the Lower Triassic (ca.−20 to −2{\%}0), with a temporary and drastic negative shift, down to roughly the same isotopic level as in the Middle Permian, just at the suspected P/Tr boundary (ca.−41 to −23{\%}0). Interestingly, the mode of isotopic excursion across the P/Tr boundary is in striking contrast to that across the K/T boundary which was recently described at Kawaruppu in Hokkado, Japan. The apparent extent of fractionation, with respect to contemporaneous seawater sulfate, in the high 34S/32S group lies within the range of −25 ± 10{\%}0, which is quantitatively equivalent to the currently confirmed range of kinetic isotope effect during bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and that in the low 34S/32S group mostly exceeds this range, giving the values typically in the range of −45 ± 10{\%}0, which is similar to what is generally observed in the present-day oceanic sediments. The present data would provide strong evidence for the development of a largely stagnant, anoxic, stratified ocean, which presumably began to form in the lower Upper Permian and persisted into the Lower Triassic, and for a brief episode of its temporary massive mixing just at the suspected P/Tr boundary. Such an oceanic oxic-anoxic history may account to some extent for the relatively high enrichments of chalcophile elements in basal Triassic sediments in the world and add a significant constraint to the current arguments on the cause and consequence of the terminal Permian mass extinction.},

abstract = {Evidence for precipitation of authigenic carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) in Long Island Sound and Mississippi Delta sediments suggests that formation of CFA is not restricted to environments of active coastal upwelling. We present porewater data suggestive of CFA formation in both these areas. Application of a sequential leaching procedure, designed specifically to separate authigenic carbonate fluorapatite from other phosphorus-containing phases, including detrital apatite of igneous or metamorphic origin, provides strong supporting evidence for authigenic apatite formation in these sediments. The size of the authigenic apatite reservoir increases with depth, indicating continued formation of CFA during early diagenesis. This depth increase is mirrored by a decrease in solid-phase organic P at both sites, suggesting that CFA is forming at the expense of organic P. Mass balance considerations, application of diagenetic models to interstitial water nutrient data and the saturation state of the interstitial water are consistent with this interpretation. Diagenetic redistribution of phosphorus among the different solid-phase reservoirs is observed at both sites and results in near perfect retention of P by these sediments over the depth intervals sampled. Formation of CFA in continental margins which do not conform to the classically defined regions of phosphorite formation renders CFA a quantitatively more important sink than has previously been recognized. Including this reservoir as a newly identified sink for reactive P in the ocean, the residence time of P in the modern ocean must be revised downward. The implication for ancient oceans of CFA formation in continental margin sediments other than phosphorites is that phosphorite formation may be less a representation of episodicity in removal of reactive P from the oceans than of localized concentration of CFA in phosphatic sediments by secondary physical processes. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The Lower Ordovician Upper Knox Group is characterized by shallowing-upward peritidal cycles that are extensively dolomitized to form massive dolomite. Most (85{\%}) replacive dolomite is stratigraphically controlled, composed of very fine to medium crystalline, planar to nonplanar (early) dolomite composed of Zones 1, 2 and 3 dolomites. Remaining dolomite occurs as medium to coarsely crystalline, nonplanar (late) replacive dolomite (Zones 2 and 3 late dolomites) that selectively replaces limestone associated with stylolites and fractures or forms massive dolomite fronts. Complexly zoned (Zone 2 to 6) saddle dolomite cements make up less than 5{\%} of all dolomite and primarily fill solution voids and fractures. Early dolomites are near stoichiometric and, relative to Early Ordovician marine carbonates, are similar to or significantly depleted in 18 O and Sr, slightly to significantly enriched in Mn and Fe, and have similar 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values. Relative to early dolomites, late (Zones 2 and 3) dolomites are depleted in 18 O and St, enriched in Mn and Fe, and have similar 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values. Early dolomites are interpreted to have formed from modified seawater during seaward progradation of tidal flats within each high-frequency (fifth- and fourth-order) cycle duration. Late dolomites, based on their texture and geochemistry, formed as a result of recrystallization of early dolomites, as direct replacement of limestone at elevated temperatures, and as cement in fractures and secondary solution voids. Covariant trends between textures and geochemical compositions for early dolomite indicate that presentday compositions of Knox early dolomite record a history of progressive diagenetic modification (stabilization or recrystallization), involving varying degrees of changes of textural and geochemical compositions during multiple episodes of dolomitization. Early dolomites with the most extensively altered textures are more stoichiometric, more depleted in 18 O and Sr, and more enriched in Mn and Fe relative to texturally less-altered early dolomite. Initial stabilization may have occurred syndepositionally in modified seawater. Continued stabilization of early dolomite likely occurred in fresh or mixed waters of a Middle Ordovician meteoric aquifer associated with Knox unconformity development. Final stabilization occurred by deep burial brines at elevated temperatures as indicated by 1) extensive replacement and overgrowth of early dolomite by late dolomites: 2) a progressive increase in crystal size and abundance of nonplanar crystal boundaries with increase in replacement by late dolomites; and 3) the similarity of the geochemical compositions of texturally most-extensively altered early dolomites and late dolomites.},

abstract = {New analyses reveal two intervals of distinctly lower 13C values in the terrestrial organic matter of Permian-Triassic sequences in northern Xinjiang, China. The younger negative 13Corg spike can be correlated to the conspicuous and sharp 13C drops both in carbonate carbon and organic carbon near the Permian-Triassic event boundary (PTEB) in the marine section at Meishan. The geochemical correlation criteria are accompanied by a magnetic susceptibility pulse and higher abundances of distinctive, chain-like organic fossil remains of Reduviasporonites. The older negative 13Corg spike originates within a latest Permian regression. Significant changes in organic geochemical proxies are recorded in the equivalent interval of the marine section at Meishan. These include relatively higher concentrations of total organic carbon, isorenieratane, C14-C30 aryl isoprenoids and lower ratios of pristane/phytane that, together, indicate the onset of anoxic, euxinic and restricted environments within the photic zone. The massive and widespread oxidation of buried organic matter that induced these euxinic conditions in the ocean would also result in increased concentrations of 13C-depleted atmospheric CO2. The latest Permian environmental stress marked by the older negative 13Corg episode can be correlated with the distinct changeover of ostracod assemblages and the occurrences of morphological abnormalities of pollen grains. These observations imply that biogeochemical disturbance was manifested on the land at the end of the Permian and that terrestrial organisms responded to it before the main extinction of the marine fauna.  2008 Elsevier B.V.},

Some changes are gradual and benign, but others, especially those associated with catastrophic mass extinction, are relatively abrupt and destructive. What sets one group apart from the other? Here, I hypothesize that perturbations of Earth's carbon cycle lead to mass extinction if they exceed either a critical rate at long time scales or a critical size at short time scales. By analyzing 31 carbon isotopic events during the past 542 million years, I identify the critical rate with a limit imposed by mass conservation. Identification of the crossover time scale separating fast from slow events then yields the critical size. The modern critical size for the marine carbon cycle is roughly similar to the mass of carbon that human activities will likely have added to the oceans by the year 2100.},

Carbon and oxygen isotope data for the shell material are divided into habitat subsets (high-, mid-, low-latitude and deep sea), and whole rock data are separated by mineralogy into calcite/dolomite subsets. Trend, correlation, wavelet, and spectral analyses on Gaussian-filtered isotope records were applied to detect and quantify similarities and patterns in temporal records with the following results:(1)Oxygen isotope trends from the "high-latitude" and "deep-sea" habitats are almost indistinguishable through the last 115??Ma, consistent with the existence of the "oceanic conveyor belt" throughout this interval;(2)All oxygen isotope habitat records show a strong, coherent 30-45??Ma (??? 38??Ma) cyclicity throughout the Cretaceous and the Cenozoic(3)Up to 70{\%} of the multi-million year variability in the ??18O record of the last 115??Ma can be simulated by the following equation:??18 O (???) = 0.64 sin (2 ?? t / 120 Ma + 0.9) + X sin (2 ?? t / 38.3 Ma + 1.1)with X ranging from 0.4-0.6??? for the "low-", "high-latitude" and "deep-sea" habitats, to 0.8??? for the "mid-latitude" realm.(1)A ??? 120 ?? 20??Ma cycle occurs in the Paleozoic and Neoproterozoic ??18O record, consistent with paleoclimate variability as interpreted from sedimentological and faunal records.(2)The offset of ??13C values between "deep water" and "high-latitude" vs. surficial habitats at lower latitudes is consistent with the operation of a biological pump in the oceans since at least the Cretaceous.(3)Sr and S isotope records exhibit a ??? 60-70??Ma cyclicity throughout the Phanerozoic. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Patterns of last occurrences of fossil species are often used to infer the tempo and timing of mass extinction, even though last occurrences generally precede the time of extinction. Numerical simulations with constant extinction demonstrate that last occurrences are not randomly distributed, but tend to cluster at subaerial unconformities, surfaces of forced regression, flooding surfaces and intervals of stratigraphical condensation, all of which occur in predictable stratigraphical positions. This clustering arises not only from hiatuses and non-deposition, but also from changes in water depth. Simulations with intervals of elevated extinction cause such clusters of last occurrences to be enhanced within and below the interval of extinction, suggesting that the timing and magnitude of extinctions in these instances could be misinterpreted. With the possible exception of the end-Cretaceous, mass extinctions in the fossil record are characterized by clusters of last occurrences at these sequence stratigraphical horizons. Although these clusters of last occurrences may represent brief pulses of elevated extinction, they are equally likely to form by stratigraphical processes during a protracted period (more than several hundred thousand years) of elevated extinction rate. Geochemical proxies of extinction causes are also affected similarly, suggesting that many local expressions of mass extinction should be re-evaluated for the timing of extinction and its relation to environmental change. We propose three tests for distinguishing pulses of extinction from clusters of last occurrences produced by stratigraphical processes.},

abstract = {A primary tool of nuclear safeguards authorities for detecting undeclared nuclear activities is environmental sample analysis containing uranium-bearing aerosol particles. SIMS (Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry) has been established as a powerful technique for performing uranium isotope analysis on safeguards samples. Typically, a screening of the sample for locating the particles of interest is followed by micro-beam measurements of individual particles in order to obtain their precise isotopic composition. The uncertainty of these measurements, in particular for the minor isotopes 234U and 236U, is mainly limited by the counting statistics as the total amount of uranium available is very low, usually less than 1 pg. This uncertainty can be reduced when recording several isotopes simultaneously using a multi-collection system. This has been available commercially for many years and has been used for different applications in geosciences on Large Geometry-SIMS (LG-SIMS) instruments. This paper will describe and discuss how isotope measurements of low content uranium materials can be optimized using a multi-ion counting system consisting of five discrete dynode electron multiplier (EM) detectors. The results obtained for uranium isotope ratios are presented for different measurement protocols: static multi-collector, dynamic multi-collector and single collector measurements. Some of the fundamental properties of the detector system that affect the overall measurement uncertainty are discussed. Best practices are also suggested based on the current experience.},

abstract = {A study of latest Permian and Early Triassic multielement conodonts identifies eight steps in their evolutionary history during an interval when Earth's biosphere was highly stressed. These steps are: 1) gradual decline of families and genera through the Changhsingian (up to the late Griesbachian); 2) conodont biofacies change and extinction of Tethyan endemic species close to the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB); 3) faunal turnover with extinction and origination in the late Griesbachian; 4) initial radiation in gondolellids and diversification in apparatuses during the Dienerian; 5) explosive radiation in the early-middle Smithian; 6) major extinction in the late Smithian; 7) major radiation early in the Spathian; 8) gradual turnover and decline in the late Spathian through early Anisian. Conodontophorids were reduced from five families at the beginning of the Changhsingian to three by the PTB, and to two late in the Griesbachian. From the Changhsingian to the late Griesbachian, there was a single multielement apparatus represented in the Gondolellidae, whereas by the Olenekian there were at least twelve. Given absolute age constraints, the conodont recovery in the aftermath of the PTB was extraordinary. Conodont evolution during the Dienerian remains obscure but was very significant in terms of changes in multielement apparatuses. In spite of Induan extinctions, generic diversity generally increased from the PTB up to the late Smithian. In terms of species, genera, and multielement apparatuses, the acme of Triassic conodonts was in the middle Smithian, and the biggest extinction was in the late Smithian. After this extinction, generic and apparatus diversity quickly returned to high levels, marking a significant Spathian recovery. Gradual decline characterized the late Spathian and persisted into the early Anisian. A synthetic summary of the temporal distribution and proposed relationships amongst all known Lower Triassic conodonts provide an improved foundation for biostratigraphic and biochronologic studies. Extinction and radiation trends correlate well with sea-level changes and sequence boundaries: faunal turnovers correspond to lowstands in the late Griesbachian, late Smithian, and late Spathian, and radiations correspond to transgressions in the early Griesbachian, early Smithian, and early Spathian. The trends also correlate with perturbations in the carbon cycle, with Lower Triassic $\delta$ 13 C minima corresponding to extinction and faunal turnover, and positive values generally occurring during radiations. However, Middle Triassic recovery of marine benthos follows a positive maxima and an overall decline in conodont diversity. New taxa Borinella chowadensis, B. megacuspa, Neogondolella griesbachensis, and N. mongeri are described. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2007.},

abstract = {Detailed measurements of two Permian-Triassic boundary sections at Guryul Ravine and Pahlgam in Kashmir indicate continuous sedimentation across the boundary, though with a marked change from shallow storm-influenced shelf to deeper shelf below wave base. Successive shell beds through the 2.5-m-thick transitional latest Permian section at Guryul formed as in situ accumulations with little sign of either erosional breaks or condensation. Faunal change takes place gradually in the late Permian transition beds, as elsewhere in the Tethyan sections. There is no major event layer at the Permian-Triassic boundary, and little evidence for dysaerobic conditions. Both the Kashmir and East Greenland Permian-Triassic sections have sedimentation rates that are orders of magnitude greater than at the condensed Meishan reference section. They show that the end-Permian extinction was associated with transgression but not with immediate onset of anoxic conditions. Macrofaunal extinction seems associated with reduction in primary production, which would also explain the dwarfism of fossils found in all Permian-Triassic sections studied so far. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Reproduction of plants in fragmented habitats may be limited because of lower diversity or abundance of pollinators, and/or variation in local plant density. We assessed natural fruit set and pollinator limitation in ten species of woody plants in natural and restored fragments in the Pondicherry region of southern India, to see whether breeding system of plants (self-compatible and self-incompatible) affected fruit set. We tested whether the number of flowering individuals in the fragments affected the fruit set and further examined the adult and sapling densities of self-compatible (SC) and self-incompatible (SI) species. We measured the natural level of fruit set and pollinator limitation (calculated as the difference in fruit set between hand cross-pollinated and naturally pollinated flowers). Our results demonstrate that there was a higher level of pollinator limitation and hence lower levels of natural fruit set in self-incompatible species as compared to self-compatible species. However, the hand cross-pollinated flowers in SC and SI species produced similar levels of fruit set, further indicating that lower fruit set was due to pollinator limitation and not due to lack of cross-compatible individuals in the fragments. There was no significant relation between number of flowering individuals and the levels of natural fruit set, except for two species Derris ovalifolia, Ixora pavetta. In these species the natural fruit set decreased with increasing population size, again indicating pollinator limitation. The adult and sapling densities in self-compatible species were significantly higher than in self-incompatible species. These findings indicate that the low reproductive output in self-incompatible species may eventually lead to lower population sizes. Restoration of pollinator services along with plant species in fragmented habitats is important for the long-term conservation of biodiversity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the question of the eventual control of barium concentration in seawater by an equilibrium with barite. For this, we have used a new thermodynamic model to compute the barite saturation index of ocean waters, mainly from GEOSECS data. Our results show that equilibrium between barite and seawater is reached in a number of places: cold surface waters of the Southern Ocean, waters at intermediate depths (2000-3500 m) in the Pacific, deep waters (2000-3500 m) of the Gulf of Bengal. The only samples for which a slight barite supersaturation is found are the surface waters at GEOSECS station G89 in the Weddell Gyre. Besides these locations, the rest of the world's oceans is undersaturated, as was established by Church and Wolgemuth [Church, T.M., Wolgemuth, K., 1972. Marine barite saturation, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 15 35-44,]. There is a return to undersaturation of the water column at depths of about 3500 m in the Pacific and of about 2500 m in the Southern Ocean. The reverse is found for GEOSECS station 446 in the Gulf of Bengal for which the highest Ba concentrations can be found at depth: surface waters are undersaturated and equilibrium is reached below 2000 m. Finally, we briefly discuss the role of biogenic and inorganic processes on barite formation in the ocean as well as the influence of strontium substitution in marine barites.},

abstract = {Methane hydrates constitute the largest pool of readily exchangeable carbon at the Earth's sedimentary carapace and may destabilize, in some cases catastrophically, during times of global-scale warming and/or sea level changes. Given the extreme cold during Neoproterozoic ice ages, the aftermath of such events is perhaps amongst the most likely intervals in Earth history to witness a methane hydrate destabilization event. The coincidence of localized but widespread methane seep-like structures and textures, methane-derived isotopic signal, low sulfate concentration, marine barites, and a prominent, short-lived carbon isotope excursion ($\delta$13C≤-5‰) from the post-Marinoan cap carbonates (∼635 Ma) provides strong evidence for a methane hydrate destabilization event during the late Neoproterozoic postglacial warming and transgression. Methane release from hydrates could cause a positive feedback to global warming and oxidation of methane could result in ocean anoxia and fluctuation of atmospheric oxygen, providing an environmental force for the early animal evolution in the latest Neoproterozoic. The issues that remain to be clarified for this event include the trigger of methane hydrate destabilization, the time of initial methane release, the predicted ocean anoxia event and its relationship with the biological innovation, additional geochemical signals in response to methane release, and the regional and global synchrony of cap carbonate precipitation. The Doushantuo cap carbonate in South China provides one of the best examples of its age for a better understanding of these issues. {\textcopyright} Science in China Press 2006.},

abstract = {Holocene stromatolites characterized by unusually positive inorganic d13CPDB values (i.e. up to +16{\&}) are present in Lagoa Salgada, a seasonally brackish to hypersaline lagoon near Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Such positive values cannot be explained by phototrophic fixation of CO2 alone, and they suggest that methanogenesis was a dominating process during the growth of the stromatolites. Indeed, up to 5 mM methane was measured in the porewater. The archaeal membrane lipid archaeol showing d13C values between 15 and 0{\&} suggests that archaea are present and producing methane in the modern lagoon sediment. Moreover, 13C-depleted hopanoids diplopterol and 3b-methylated C32 17b(H),21b(H)-hopanoic acid (both 40{\&}) are preserved in lagoon sediments and are most likely derived from aerobic methanotrophic bacteria thriving in the methane-enriched water column. Loss of isotopically light methane through the water column would explain the residual 13C-enriched pool of dissolved inorganic carbon from where the carbonate constituting the stromatolites precipitated. The predominance of methanogenic archaea in the lagoon is most likely a result of sulphate limitation, suppressing the activity of sulphate-reducing bacteria under brackish conditions in a seasonally humid tropical environment. Indeed, sulphate-reduction activity is very low in the modern sediments. In absence of an efficient carbonate-inducing metabolic process, we propose that stromatolite formation in Lagoa Salgada was abiotically induced, while the 13C-enriched organic and inorganic carbon pools are due to methanogenesis. Unusually, 13C-enriched stromatolitic deposits also appear in the geological record of prolonged periods in the Palaeo- and Neoproterozoic. Lagoa Salgada represents a possible modern analogue to conditions that may have been widespread in the Proterozoic, at times when low sulphate concentrations in sea water allowed methanogens to prevail over sulphatereducing bacteria.},

S isotope data from modern, low-sulfate euxinic systems illustrate that preserved ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values are positively correlated with sulfate concentration. However, absolute constraints on the range of low-sulfate levels over which preserved ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values vary with sulfate concentration remain poorly constrained. Here, we present a compilation of S isotope data for modern euxinic systems demonstrating that preserved ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values increase with sulfate concentration at low sulfate levels and approach values that are similar to in situ S isotope fractionation values from microbial sulfate reduction at high sulfate levels. We compare these results to a closed system model of S isotope cycling in a euxinic ocean in order to evaluate when the size of the sulfate reservoir is sufficiently small that Rayleigh fractionation affects the preservation of S isotope signatures. We conclude that the reservoir effect places constraints on ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values deposited in euxinic settings at sulfate concentrations {\textless}5mM. Thus, over this range, ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values can be used to evaluate ancient sulfate levels. At higher sulfate levels ({\textgreater}10mM), ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S values are similar to the kinetic isotope fractionation due to microbial sulfate reduction and therefore provide information about biological and environmental controls on sulfate reduction rates and location of pyrite formation. The results of this compilation provide an improved model for the use of ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S records to evaluate paleoenvironmental conditions in euxinic depositional environments.},

abstract = {After the worldwide drastic Permo-Triassic event, a thick sequence of shallow-water carbonates, i.e., the Sefid Kuh Formation, was formed before the late Early Triassic. For the first time dasycladacean algae (Acicularia sp.) were found there, together with foraminifera which are typical of the Lower Triassic. A carbonate ramp is formed by several parasequences, each of them shallowing upwards and consisting of grainstones and packstones, being oolithic and/or pelletoidal, mudstones being strongly affected by bioturbation ("Wurstelkalk", "vermicular limestone"), crinoids ("Holocrinus" sp.), packstone tempestites, and algal boundstones. The Sefid Kuh limestone formation as a whole is the product of a transgression-regression cycle. According to conodont stratigraphical studies, this cycle set in at Spathian times and came to an end in ?Aegean/Bithynian times. This T-R cycle is probably of eustatic nature, as comparisons with coeval sequences of the western Tethys realm show. Geodynamic considerations of R. Brandner result in the conclusion that in the area studied the northern Paleozoic Tethys ocean was entirely subducted already in Permo-Triassic times.},

abstract = {The Dinwoody Formation of the western United States represents an important archive of Early Triassic ecosystems in the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. We present a systematic description and a quantitative paleoecological analysis of its benthic faunas in order to reconstruct benthic associations and to explore the temporal and spatial variations of diversity, ecological structure and taxonomic composition throughout the earliest Triassic of the western United States. A total of 15 bivalve species, two gastropod species, and two brachiopod species are recognized in the study area. The paleoecological analysis shows that the oldest Dinwoody communities are characterized by low diversity, low ecological complexity and high dominance of few species. We suggest that this low diversity most likely reflects the consequences of the mass extinction in the first place and not necessarily the persistence of environmental stress. Whereas this diversity pattern persists into younger strata of the Dinwoody Formation in outer shelf environments, an increase in richness, evenness and guild diversity occurred around the Griesbachian-Dienerian boundary in more shallow marine habitats. This incipient recovery towards the end of the Griesbachian is in accordance with observations from other regions and thus probably represents an interregional signal. In contrast to increasing richness within communities (alpha-diversity), beta-diversity remained low during the Griesbachian and Dienerian in the study area. This low beta-diversity reflects a wide environmental and geographical range of taxa during the earliest Triassic, indicating that the increase of within-habitat diversity has not yet led to significant competitive exclusion. We hypothesize that the well-known prevalence of generalized taxa in post-extinction faunas is primarily an effect of reduced competition that allows species to exist through the full range of their fundamental niches, rather than being caused by unusual and uniform environmental stress.

The pathway of trace metals transported from rivers to the ocean seems to be complicated, and largely influenced by biogeochemical processes taking place in the estuarine mixing zone. Colloidal material (104Daltons-0.4 $\mu$m), in addition to its significant contribution to the so-called 'dissolved' fraction, has been shown to play a fundamental role in determining the behaviour of both conservative and non-conservative trace metals during estuarine mixing. Hence, colloids may control to a large extent the fate of 'dissolved' trace metals as well as their net input from the rivers to the Kara Sea. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Boreholes taken around the M4–M5 motorway junction in SW England provide measured sections with multiple Rhaetian bone beds. The microvertebrate samples in the various bone beds differ through time in their composition and in average specimen size. The onset of the Rhaetian transgression accumulated organic debris to form a fossiliferous layer high in biodiversity at the base of the Westbury Formation. The bone bed at the top of the Westbury Formation represents a community with lower biodiversity. The bone beds differ in their faunas: chondrichthyan teeth are dominant in the basal bone bed, but actinopterygians dominate the higher bone bed. These differences could be taphonomic, but are more likely evidence for ecological-evolutionary changes. Further, a change from larger to smaller specimen sizes up-sequence allows rejection of an earlier idea that the successive bone beds represented multiple reworkings of older bone beds.},

abstract = {The oxygen isotope composition of siderites can be used to deduce the temperature and/or oxygen isotope composition of the fluids from which they precipitated. Previous siderite-water oxygen isotope fractionation calibrations are not well constrained at temperatures below 33 °C where most of the siderite forms at the Earth's surface. Moreover, the few experimental low temperature calibration points available are possibly inaccurate as the corresponding siderites may not have formed in equilibrium with the solution. In this study, we synthesized siderite in the laboratory from 8.5 to 62 °C, using both active-degassing experiments and microbial cultures. We used the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which significantly reduces the equilibration time of oxygen isotopes among all dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) species and water to minimize siderite formation out of equilibrium. Our calibration is based on many more data points than previous calibrations and significantly reduces the uncertainty in siderite-water oxygen isotope fractionation in natural siderites formed at low temperatures.

abstract = {A 2-4{\%} negative shift of $\delta$13C has been reported from many Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary sections around the world. Our carbon isotopic measurements of bulk carbonate and organic matter from the Meishan section, South China show that a -3{\%} shift of $\delta$13C spanned 30 ka over the end-Permian mass extinction. Carbon isotopic excursions ($\delta$13Ccarb, $\delta$13Corg) coupled with $\Delta$13C (=$\delta$13Ccarb-$\delta$13Corg), marine kerogen {\%}, 87Sr/86Sr of siliciclastics and total organic carbon show geochemical signals underwent six geochemical variation zones (GVZ) over the P/Tr transition. Of these, GVZ 1 corresponds to the lower-middle parts of Bed 24e-1, GVZ 2 to the upper part of Bed 24e-1, GVZ 3 to Beds 24e-2, 24e-3, 25-2 and 25-2, GVZ 4 to Bed 25-3, GVZ 5 to Bed 26, and GVZ 6 to Beds 27-29. A-1{\%}shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka before the main extinction was probably generated by possible dissociation of methane hydrate by warming. Subsequent mixing of anoxic stratified ocean led to another-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 5 ka during the extinction. The-1{\%} shift of $\delta$13C within 13 ka after the main extinction has probably resulted from massive denudation of soil and sediments caused by the collapse of forests and possible dissociation of methane hydrate at the end of the Permian. Furthermore, a dramatic drop of $\Delta$13C values from 29-30{\%} in Bed 24e-3 to 25{\%} in Bed 25 indicates an abrupt proliferation of phototrophic sulfur bacteria immediately after the main episode of the end-Permian mass extinction. The $\Delta$13C value increases to 29-30{\%} in Bed 26 again, and this is probably due to massive denudation of soil and sediment caused by the collapse of forests between 0 and 27 ka after the main extinction, as revealed by negative shift of $\delta$13C. Low $\Delta$13C value recorded in Beds 27-29 indicates that phototrophic sulfur bacteria may have thrived again and lasted more than 150 ka after the main extinction in the low-latitude Paleo-Tethys. {\textcopyright} 2009 Geological Society of Australia.},

Regardless of sediment type, feeding was necessary in the experiments started with first-instar larvae. The effects of sediment physicochemical characteristics on larval growth and development could not be totally compensated for by food addition. When fed, larvae grew best in sandy sediment with low organic carbon content (0.5{\%}). Acceptable survival was achieved with a very low food dose (0.03 mg/larva/d), but a somewhat higher dose (0.12 mg/larva/d) is recommended. Increment of feeding accelerated larval growth and development. Larval growth was correlated to the food dose per individual and to the density of food particles on the sediment surface.},

abstract = {A major late Paleozoic depocentre, the Sverdrup Basin, Canadian High Arctic, has been largely left out of the latest Permian extinction debate, as early workers presumed Middle to Late Permian strata were absent. Basin-scale sequence-stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic correlations indicate Late Permian strata are only missing on the basin margins, where they were removed by sub-Triassic erosion, whereas continuous deposition is recorded in the basin centre. The varying degree of sub-Triassic erosion has significant impact on the carbon-isotope record across the Latest Permian Extinction event, where both the apparent rate and magnitude of carbon-isotope shift vary as a function of basin position. The intrabasin variability in apparent $\delta$13Corg shift across the event is equivalent to that observed globally. In contrast to the abrupt isotope shifts recorded on the basin margin, similar to many records reported globally, the basin centre section shows a systematic shift associated with the Latest Permian Extinction. The Earth likely underwent a prolonged period of increasing environmental stress leading up to the event.},

abstract = {The transition between the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic eons, beginning 542 million years (Myr) ago, is distinguished by the diversification of multicellular animals and by their acquisition of mineralized skeletons during the Cambrian period. Considerable progress has been made in documenting and more precisely correlating biotic patterns in the Neoproterozoic-Cambrian fossil record with geochemical and physical environmental perturbations, but the mechanisms responsible for those perturbations remain uncertain. Here we use new stratigraphic and geochemical data to show that early Palaeozoic marine sediments deposited approximately 540-480 Myr ago record both an expansion in the area of shallow epicontinental seas and anomalous patterns of chemical sedimentation that are indicative of increased oceanic alkalinity and enhanced chemical weathering of continental crust. These geochemical conditions were caused by a protracted period of widespread continental denudation during the Neoproterozoic followed by extensive physical reworking of soil, regolith and basement rock during the first continental-scale marine transgression of the Phanerozoic. The resultant globally occurring stratigraphic surface, which in most regions separates continental crystalline basement rock from much younger Cambrian shallow marine sedimentary deposits, is known as the Great Unconformity. Although Darwin and others have interpreted this widespread hiatus in sedimentation on the continents as a failure of the geologic record, this palaeogeomorphic surface represents a unique physical environmental boundary condition that affected seawater chemistry during a time of profound expansion of shallow marine habitats. Thus, the formation of the Great Unconformity may have been an environmental trigger for the evolution of biomineralization and the 'Cambrian explosion' of ecologic and taxonomic diversity following the Neoproterozoic emergence of animals.},

Species distribution and transformation processes in natural aquatic systems are controlled by various physical, chemical, and biological factors. Depending on the prevailing environmental conditions, inorganic mercury species may be converted to many times more toxic methylated forms such as methylmercury, a potent neurotoxin that is readily accumulated by aquatic biota. Despite a considerable amount of literature on the subject, the behavior of mercury and many of the transformation and distribution mechanisms operating in the natural aquatic environment are still poorly understood. This review examines the current state of knowledge on the physicochemical behavior of mercury in the aquatic environment, and in particular the environmental factors influencing its transformation into highly toxic methylated forms.},

abstract = {The Dutch ethologist Niko Tinbergen famously distinguished between proximal and ultimate explanations in biology. Proximally, biologists seek a mechanistic understanding of how organisms function; most of this volume addresses the molecular and physiological bases of biomineralization. But while much of biology might be viewed as a particularly interesting form of chemistry, it is more than that. Biology is chemistry with a history, requiring that proximal explanations be grounded in ultimate, or evolutionary, understanding. The physiological pathways by which organisms precipitate skeletal minerals and the forms and functions of the skeletons they fashion have been shaped by natural selection through geologic time, and all have constrained continuing evolution in skeleton-forming clades. In this chapter, I outline some major patterns of skeletal evolution inferred from phylogeny and fossils (Figure 1⇓), highlighting ways that our improving mechanistic knowledge of biomineralization can help us to understand this evolutionary record (see Leadbetter and Riding 1986; Lowenstam and Weiner 1989; Carter 1990; and Simkiss and Wilbur 1989 for earlier reviews). Figure 1. A geologic time scale for the past 1000 million years, showing the principal time divisions used in Earth science and the timing of major evolutionary events discussed in this chapter. Earlier intervals of time—the Mesoproterozoic (1600–1000 million years ago) and Paleoproterozoic (2500–1600 million years ago) eras of the Proterozoic Eon and the Archean Eon ({\textgreater} 2500 million years ago)—are not shown. Time scale after Remane (2000). My discussion proceeds from two simple observations: Skeletal biomineralization requires energy and so imposes a metabolic cost on skeleton-forming organisms. Mineralized skeletons have evolved in many clades of protists, plants and animals. If both statements are true, then clearly for many but not all eukaryotic organisms the biological benefits of biomineralization must outweigh its costs. But cost-benefit ratio is not static. It will change through {\ldots}},

abstract = {The Lower Triassic sedimentary and carbonate/organic carbon isotope records from the Tulong area (South Tibet) are documented in their integrality for the first time. New age control is provided by ammonoid and conodont biostratigraphy. The basal Triassic series consists of Griesbachian dolomitic limestones, similar to the Kathwai Member in the Salt Range (Pakistan) and to the Otoceras Beds in Spiti (India). The overlying thin-bedded limestones of Dienerian age strongly resemble the Lower Ceratite Limestone of the Salt Range. They are followed by a thick series of dark green, silty shales of Dienerian-early Smithian age without fauna that strikingly resemble the Ceratite Marls of the Salt Range. This interval is overlain by thin-bedded, light grey fossil-rich limestones of middle to late Smithian age, resembling the Upper Ceratite Limestone of the Salt Range. These are followed by a shale interval of early Spathian age that has no direct counterpart in other Tethyan sections. Carbonate production resumes during the late early and middle Spathian with the deposition of red, bioclastic nodular limestone ("Ammonitico Rosso" type facies). Apart from its colour this facies is similar to the one of the Niti Limestone in Spiti and of the Spathian nodular limestone in Guangxi (South China). As in other Tethyan localities such as Spiti, the early-middle Anisian part of the Tulong section is strongly condensed and is characterized by grey, thin-bedded limestones with phosphatized ammonoids. As for many other Tethyan localities the carbon isotope record from Tulong is characterized by a late Griesbachian-Dienerian positive $\delta$ 13C carb excursion (2‰), and a very prominent positive excursion (5‰) at the Smithian-Spathian boundary, thus confirming the well-documented perturbations of the global carbon cycle following the Permian-Triassic mass extinction event. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Fourteen conodont taxa are identified, including Clarkina kazi, Clarkina lehrmanni n. sp., Clarkina taylorae, Clarkina zhejiangensis, Hindeodus eurypyge, Hindeodus inflatus, Hindeodus sxlatidentatus, Hindeodus parvus erectus, Hindeodus parvus parvus, Hindeodus postparvus, Hindeodus praeparvus, Hindeodus typicalis, Isarcicella staeschei, and Merrillina ultima based on a detailed study of the Permian-Triassic interval at the Dawen section. The first occurrence (FO) of H. parvus parvus in the lower Daye Formation, at about 7.45 m above the contact surface between the Upper Permian skeletal packstone and a calcimicrobial framestone unit, is correlated with the Permian-Triassic boundary; the occurrence of H. eurypyge, H. praeparvus and M. ultima immediately below and H. postparvus above the interval supports this interpretation. A morphometric analysis of 31 Hindeodus specimens helped distinguish H. parvus erectus from H. parvus parvus and H. postparvus. Correlation with the Meishan section (PTB GSSP) using both conodont biostratigraphy and carbon isotopes, indicates that the major extinction at the two localities is simultaneous and coincides with the top of the skeletal packstone at Dawen. The contact between the skeletal packstone and the calcimicrobialite is very irregular and has previously been interpreted as a dissolution surface and correlated with a surface in the lower part of bed 27 at Meishan. Our results confirm this interpretation and reveal that the dissolution event postdated the extinction. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Indeed, chemical analyses of hydrocarbon-rich habitats with limited or no access of oxygen indicated in situ biodegradation of short-chain hydrocarbons. Here we report the enrichment of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) with such capacity from marine hydrocarbon seep areas. Propane or n-butane as the sole growth substrate led to sediment-free sulphate-reducing enrichment cultures growing at 12, 28 or 60 degrees C. With ethane, a slower enrichment with residual sediment was obtained at 12 degrees C. Isolation experiments resulted in a mesophilic pure culture (strain BuS5) that used only propane and n-butane (methane, isobutane, alcohols or carboxylic acids did not support growth). Complete hydrocarbon oxidation to CO2 and the preferential oxidation of 12C-enriched alkanes were observed with strain BuS5 and other cultures. Metabolites of propane included iso- and n-propylsuccinate, indicating a subterminal as well as an unprecedented terminal alkane activation with involvement of fumarate. According to 16S ribosomal RNA analyses, strain BuS5 affiliates with Desulfosarcina/Desulfococcus, a cluster of widespread marine SRB. An enrichment culture with propane growing at 60 degrees C was dominated by Desulfotomaculum-like SRB. Our results suggest that diverse SRB are able to thrive in seep areas and gas reservoirs on propane and butane, thus altering the gas composition and contributing to sulphide production.},

abstract = {The end-Permian extinction event was the most pronounced biotic and ecological crisis in the history of the Earth. It is assumed that over 80{\%} of marine genera disappeared, and that this event had a major impact on the evolution of marine organisms. The impact of this event on terrestrial biota is poorly known and a matter of controversial discussions. In contrast to the fundamental changes in marine fauna most major groups of plants range from the Late Palaeozoic into the Mesozoic. Consequently the impact of the end-Permian extinction event on the evolution of plants was often regarded as minor. However, major changes in the composition of the plant communities have been documented and a number of catastrophic scenarios have been envisioned - including the almost total destruction of plant ecosystems. Based on expanded sections from the Southern Barents Sea (Northern Norway) we trace mid-latitudinal terrestrial ecosystems across the Permo-Triassic transition with a time resolution in the order of 10kyr, based on a high resolution Corg-isotope stratigraphy. Our results show that the floral turnovers are linked with major changes in the C-isotope record and hence with global carbon cycling. The palynological records document the successive steps in the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems. After gradual changes during the latest Permian, plant ecosystems suffered from a major environmental perturbation leading to a rapid turnover from gymnosperm dominated ecosystems to assemblages dominated by lycopods. The dominance of the lycopods, expressed in a spore-spike, represents a relatively short-lived event in the order of 10kyr. This perturbation of the terrestrial ecosystems preceded the globally recognized negative $\delta$13Corg isotope spike by up to 100kyr. It coincides with a first end-Permian negative shift of the C-isotope curve and was probably induced by a first major perturbation of the chemistry of the atmosphere, related to the onset of the volcanic activity of the Siberian Traps. Gymnosperms recovered prior to the major isotopic shift. The fast recovery of terrestrial ecosystem explains why all major plant groups survived the end-Permian extinction event while the majority of marine organisms were wiped out. The concordance of pattern of the $\delta$13Corg in globally distributed marine and terrestrial sequences enables us to link turnovers in the terrestrial environment with marine extinction events. It demonstrates that the demise and the onset of the recovery of the terrestrial ecosystems was a global phenomenon and occurred prior to the major isotopic shift. The successive negative shifts in $\delta$13Corg isotope values are thought to reflect CO2 input into the atmosphere by multiphase volcanic activity (Siberian Traps) or other consecutive events (e.g. methane release). {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, it cannot be used with confidence for 'blind dating'. The compilation of isotopic data on carbonate rocks reveals a high level of inconsistency between various carbon isotope age curves constructed for Neoproteozoic seawater, caused by a relatively high frequency of both global and local delta C-13(carb) fluctuations combined with few reliable age determinations. Further complication is caused by the unresolved problem as to whether two or four glaciations, and associated negative delta C-13(carb) excursions, can be reliably documented. Carbon isotope stratigraphy cannot be used alone for geological correlation and 'blind dating'. Strontium isotope stratigraphy is a more reliable and precise tool for stratigraphic correlations and indirect age determinations. Combining strontium and carbon isotope stratigraphy, several discrete ages within the 590-544 Myr interval, and two age-groups at 660-610 and 740-690 Myr can be resolved.},

New data for organic carbon isotope ratios (??13Corg) were obtained from 36 samples from section Am-2. The ??13Corg excursion curve exhibits a negative shift of 2.0??? in the low-latitude, pelagic Panthalassic Ocean at the end of the Permian, which coincides with a radiolarian extinction. The ??13Corg values of pelagic, deep-sea Panthalassic sections and those of shallow-water sections from Panthalassic seamounts exhibit a smooth, negative shift that lacks temporary increases like those reported from Paleotethyan PTB sections. Absence of temporary ??13Corg increases at the PTB in Panthalassa may reflect less algal and bacterial blooming in pelagic Panthalassa compared to the shallow-water Paleotethys.},

@article{Bottjer2004,
abstract = {Lower Triassic strata in the western United States and northern Italy have yielded the first reported occurrence of microbially mediated wrinkle structures in shallow subtidal siliciclastic paleoenvironments since the Cambrian. We hypothesize that wrinkle structures formed under reduced infaunalization conditions during the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. These wrinkle structures occur in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks in association with hummocky cross-stratification and, in some cases, trace fossils such as Asteriacites, Rhizocorallium, Planolites, and Gyrochorte that indicate a subtidal paleoenvironment. Wrinkle structures were found in the Campil Member in the Werfen Formation of northern Italy and in the Virgin Limestone Member of the Moenkopi Formation and the upper member of the Thaynes Formation exposed in the western United States. The presence of wrinkle structures is likely related to a unique taphonomic window that allowed for the preservation of these delicate features on storm-dominated siliciclastic shelves. Wrinkle structures commonly formed in a variety of subtidal paleoenvironments during the Proterozoic-Cambrian, but thereafter became restricted to intertidalsupratidal and deep-sea environments. This restriction has been attributed to the increase in infaunalization of metazoans following the Cambrian radiation. The proliferation of wrinkle structures in subtidal settings during the Early Triassic suggests that infaunal bioturbation was reduced after the end-Permian mass extinction and that this reduction lasted for millions of years.},

It has yielded a standard Rhaetian marine fauna, including eight species of sharks, four species of actinopterygian fishes, and the reptiles Pachystropheus and Ichthyosaurus, all of which are widely known from coeval sites. An unusual feature is the occurrence of an unidentified coelacanth, represented by nine isolated quadrates showing a broad range of sizes. The site has also provided information on the occurrence of vertebrates through five distinctive bone-bearing horizons, including the famous basal Westbury Formation bone bed, as well as a second horizon with bones at the top of the Westbury Formation, and three within the overlying Cotham Member of the Lilstock Formation. These show substantial differences, especially between the basal bone bed and the four overlying bone-rich units. The basal Westbury Formation bone bed is dominated by shark remains (73{\%}, compared to 23-30{\%} in the four overlying units), most notably, teeth of Rhomphaiodon minor and Lissodus minimus, which are absent or rare in higher beds. Further, teeth of the bony fishes Gyrolepis albertii and Severnichthys acuminatus are rare in the basal bone bed, but abundant at the top of the Westbury Formation and through the Cotham Member, and the sharks Duffinselache holwellensis and Pseudocetorhinus pickfordi, absent in the basal bone bed, are relatively abundant in the four overlying bone-bearing units. These differences in faunal lists and in relative proportions probably do not reflect sampling, but some major differences in ecology and evolution.},

Past theoretical models for predicting the tortuosity from porosity data do not work with marine muds, and scientists and engineers have had to resort to entirely empirical models, without a mechanistic explanation and with unknown predictive power. We offer the first geometric model for the dependence of tortuosity on porosity in marine muds; the model is based on the tortuosity of separated layers of nonoverlapping disks. The fitted geometric constant in this model indicates that natural marine sediments act as if their fabric were made of disks with thickness:diameter ratios very close to 1:2, which indicates a blocklike fabric with respect to diffusion. The model was also applied to predict the tortuosity of a variety of sediments and soils not in the original database, and it provides a satisfactory prediction of the mean trend in these data.},

abstract = {Land plants and their associated microbiota directly affect silicate mineral weathering in several ways: by generation of chelating ligands, by modifying pH through production of CO2 or organic acids, and by altering the physical properties of a soil, particularly the exposed surface areas of minerals and the residence time of water. In laboratory experiments far from equilibrium, 1 mM oxalate (a strong chelator of Al) has a negligible effect on the dissolution rate of alkali feldspars, but some effect on calcic feldspars and olivine. By analogy to oxalate, the overall effect of organic ligands on the weathering rate of silicate minerals in nature is likely to be small, except perhaps in microenvironments adjacent to roots and fungal hyphae. The effect of pH on silicate mineral dissolution rate depends on pH: below pH 4-5, the rate increases with decreasing pH, in the circumneutral region the rate is pH-independent, and at pH values above around 8 the rate increases with increasing pH. Vegetation should thus cause an increase in weathering rate through the pH effect only where the pH is below 4-5. As an overall generalization, the effect of plants on weathering rate through changes in soil-solution chemistry is probably small for granitic rocks; it may be greater for more mafic rocks. It is the release of Ca and Mg from mafic rocks that has the greatest influence on the global CO2 budget. The effect of changes in soil physical properties on weathering rate can be major. By binding fine particles, plants can greatly increase weathering rates in areas of high physical erosion. Where erosion rates are lower, the effect of plants is less clear. On long timescales plants may decrease chemical weathering by binding secondary products and isolating unweathered minerals from meteoric water. A major unknown in estimating the effect of the advent of land plants on weathering rates is the nature (thickness, particle size distribution, permeability) of the regolith on the pre-Silurian continents. The indirect effect of vegetation through changing the regional distribution of precipitation may be as important as the direct effects. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

These reefs experienced substantial diel fluctuations in temperature (0.78°C) and pH ({\textgreater}0.2) similar to the magnitude of 'warming' and 'acidification' expected over the next century. Where daily pH within the benthic boundary layer failed to exceed pelagic climatological seasonal lows, net accretion was slower and fleshy, non-calcifying benthic organisms dominated space.

abstract = {Comparing the timing of massextinctions with the formation age of largeigneousprovinces reveals a close correspondence in five cases, but previous claims that all such provinces coincide with extinction events are unduly optimistic. The best correlation occurs for four consecutive mid-Phanerozoic examples, namely the end-Guadalupian extinction/Emeishan flood basalts, the end-Permian extinction/Siberian Traps, the end-Triassic extinction/central Atlantic volcanism and the early Toarcian extinction/Karoo Traps. Curiously, the onset of eruptions slightly post-dates the main phase of extinctions in these examples. Of the seven post-Karoo provinces, only the Deccan Traps coincide with a massextinction, but in this case, the nature of the biotic crisis is best reconciled with the effects of a major bolide impact. Intraoceanic volcanism may also be implicated in a relatively minor end-Cenomanian extinction crisis, although once again the main phase of volcanism occurs after the crisis. The link between largeigneousprovince formation and extinctions remains enigmatic; volume of extrusives and extinction intensity are unrelated and neither is there any apparent relationship with the rapidity of province formation. Violence of eruptions (proportions of pyroclastics) also appears unimportant. Six out of 11 provinces coincide with episodes of global warming and marine anoxia/dysoxia, a relationship that suggests that volcanic CO2 emissions may have an important effect on global climate. Conversely, there is little, if any, geological evidence for cooling associated with continental flood basalt eruptions suggesting little long-term impact of SO2 emissions. Large carbon isotope excursions are associated with some extinction events and intervals of flood basalt eruption but these are too great to be accounted for by the release of volcanic CO2 alone. Thus, voluminous volcanism may in some circumstances trigger calamitous global environmental changes (runaway greenhouses), perhaps by causing the dissociation of gas hydrates. The variable efficiency of global carbon sinks during volcanic episodes may be an important control on environmental effects and may explain why the eruption of some vast igneousprovinces, such as the Paran{\'{a}}Etendeka Traps, have little perceptible climatic impact.},

abstract = {The early diagenesis of sulfur was assessed in four short sediment cores on the continental shelf off southeastern Brazil that were deposited under the influence of an upwelling tropical system. This tropical upwelling area allows a direct focus on the coupled roles of hydrodynamic- and bioturbation-driven influences on sulfate reduction, sulfide re-oxidation and corresponding stable sulfur isotope signal formation. Under the depositional conditions of Cabo Frio, the degree of reactive iron pyritization was limited by both dissolved sulfide availability and pyrite oxidation events. Textural analyses of pyrite framboids provide evidence of re-oxidation processes, reflecting dynamic redox conditions in the sediments. The isotope composition of pore-water sulfate remained close to the modern seawater value, but very light stable sulfur isotope ratios (S-34/S-32) of chromium reducible sulfur (essentially pyrite) are found that reflect intense bioturbation-induced sulfur re-cycling. The sulfur isotope signatures developing in these tropical upwelling sites are similar to those of modern euxinic systems, although they are caused by a superimposition of sulfate reduction and an intense oxidative sulfur cycle.},

abstract = {Organic carbon-rich sediments are enriched in several redox-sensitive and stable sulfide-forming trace metals (TM) and form an important sink in global TM cycles. In today's ocean such sediments are deposited in coastal upwelling areas like those in the Gulf of California, off Peru or off the Namibian coast and euxinic basins like the Black Sea. In an attempt to distinguish both environments by their specific TM patterns, some important conclusions may be drawn: 1) The TM enrichment seen in both environments broadly is rather similar. 2) Upwelling sediments are often enriched in Cd and P and depleted in Co and Mn. 3) Sapropels have a tendency towards higher enrichments in Ba and Mo, S, Re, As, Cu, Ni, Sb, and Fe, reflecting the strong sulfidation in an anoxic water column. 4) Upwelling systems cover a broad range of environmental settings where the steepness of the slope, the proximity of H2S to the sediment seawater interface and the intensity of bio-accumulation and regeneration play an important role for TM accumulation. 5) The TM content of anoxic basins is mainly controlled by TM availability in the water column and sedimentation rate. 6) Enhanced bio-productivity is the main switch turning an oxygenated into an anoxic environment. Cretaceous black shales (OAE 2) exhibit TM signatures of both, coastal upwelling areas and sapropels. The strong enrichments in Cd, Mo, Tl, V, Cu, Ni, (Bi), and Sb demonstrate that bio-accumulation and presence of H2S in the water column and associated sulfidation processes persisted during this time interval in large parts of the Proto-Atlantic. The usefulness of Ba as a paleoproductivity-proxy is obscured by diagenesis. The extreme accumulation in Ag and Zn requires either an additional TM source, for instance hydrothermal input, or a different TM seawater composition during the Cretaceous. The geochemical data suggest, that the major driving force for the widespread occurrence of C/T black shales seems to be the increase in volcanic activity and associated CO2-input throughout the Cretaceous. The ocean-atmosphere system operated in a mode different from today during this time interval. After conversion of the "nutrient" CO2 into organic matter the system switched back into the "normal" operational mode. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A carbonate crust, with a principally digitate structure, caps latest Permian reef complexes in east Sichuan, China. The crust contains the conodont Hindeodus parvus, confirming its age as earliest Triassic; it therefore closely postdates the end-Permian mass extinction, and is related to associated palaeoenvironmental change. Although its branches have lobate margins, and internal structures of radial fabrics and lobate fabrics in different specimens, an organic origin cannot be confirmed, because crust fabric is largely recrystallised. Therefore we apply the term ?microbialite to reflect uncertainty of its nature. The crust is co-eval (within the parvus Zone) with confirmed microbial biostromes and mounds in Guizhou Province, south of Sichuan. The sum of evidence, assembled by workers in several sites worldwide, indicates a sea-level rise occurred in the boundary interval, and this is corroborated by facies of the Sichuan crust. Abrupt appearance and disappearance of the crust, formed by precipitated carbonates, in east Sichuan, represents short-lived unusual post-extinction marine conditions which were switched abruptly on, then off. Microbial deposits overlying the P/T boundary in other locations in the Tethys Ocean (Iran and Japan) support the view that the unusual oceanic conditons had at least a regional distribution. Because the crust abruptly terminates, and is not succeeded by fossil-rich deposits, application of the disaster biota concept is inappropriate; an environmentally-driven control on carbonate precipitation is better supported by the evidence, whether or not it was biotically-mediated.},

abstract = {In order to evaluate details of the partitioning behaviours of Y, rare earth elements (REEs), and Ti between inorganic metal oxide surfaces and seawater, we studied the distribution of these elements in hydrogenetic marine ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts from the Central Pacific Ocean. Nonphosphatized Fe-Mn crusts display shale-normalized rare earths and yttrium (REYSN) patterns (Y inserted between Dy and Ho) that are depleted in light REEs (LREEs) and which show negative anomalies for YSN, and positive anomalies for LaSN, EuSN, GdSN, and in most cases, CeSN. They show considerably smaller Y/ Ho ratios than seawater or common igneous and clastic rocks, indicating that Y and Ho are fractionated in the marine environment. Compared to P-poor crusts, REYSN patterns of phosphatized Fe-Mn crusts are similar, but yield pronounced positive YSN anomalies, stronger positive LaSN anomalies, and enrichment of the HREEs relative to the MREEs. The data suggest modification of REY during phosphatization and indicate that studies requiring primary REY distributions or isotopic ratios should be restricted to nonphosphatized (layers of) Fe-Mn crusts. Apparent bulk coefficients, KMD, describing trace metal partitioning between nonphosphatized hydrogenetic Fe-Mn crusts and seawater, are similar for Pr to Eu and decrease for Eu to Yb. Exceptionally high values of KCeD, which are similar to those of Ti, result from oxidative scavenging of Ce and support previous suggestions that Ce(IV) is a hydroxide-dominated element in seawater. Yttrium and Gd show lower KD values than their respective neighbours in the REY series. Results of modelling the exchange equilibrium between REY dissolved in seawater and REY sorbed on hydrous Fe-Mn oxides corroborate previous studies that suggested the surface complexation of REY can be approximated by their first hydroxide binding constant. Negative "anomalies" occur for stabilities of bulk surface complexes of Gd, La, and particularly Y. The differences in inorganic surface complex stability between Y and Ho and between Gd and its REE neighbours are similar to those shown by the stabilities of complexes with aminocarboxylic acids and are significantly larger than those shown by stabilities of complexes with carboxylic acids. Hence, sorption of Y and REEs onto hydrous Fe-Mn oxides may contribute significantly to the positive YSN and GdSN anomalies in seawater.},

abstract = {The recrystallisation (dissolution-precipitation) of carbonate sediments has been successfully modelled to explain profiles of pore water Sr concentration and radiogenic Sr isotope composition at different locations of the global ocean. However, there have been few systematic studies trying to better understand the relative importance of factors influencing the variability of carbonate recrystallisation. Here we present results from a multi-component study of recrystallisation in sediments from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 320/321 Pacific Equatorial Age Transect (PEAT), where sediments of similar initial composition have been subjected to different diagenetic histories. The PEAT sites investigated exhibit variable pore water Sr concentrations gradients with the largest gradients in the youngest sites. Radiogenic Sr isotopes suggest recrystallisation was relative rapid, consistent with modelling of other sediment columns, as the 87Sr/86Sr ratios are indistinguishable (within 2?? uncertainties) from contemporaneous seawater 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Bulk carbonate leachates and associated pore waters of Site U1336 have lower 87Sr/86Sr ratios than contemporaneous seawater in sediments older than 20.2Ma most likely resulting from the upward diffusion of Sr from older recrystallised carbonates. It seems that recrystallisation at Site U1336 may still be on-going at depths below 102.5rmcd (revised metres composite depth) suggesting a late phase of recrystallisation. Furthermore, the lower Sr/Ca ratios of bulk carbonates of Site U1336 compared to the other PEAT sites suggest more extensive diagenetic alteration as less Sr is incorporated into secondary calcite. Compared to the other PEAT sites, U1336 has an inferred greater thermal gradient and a higher carbonate content. The enhanced thermal gradient seems to have made these sediments more reactive and enhanced recrystallisation. In this study we investigate stable Sr isotopes from carbonate-rich deep sea sediments for the first time. Pore water ??88/86Sr increases with depth (from 0.428??? to values reaching up to 0.700???) at Site U1336 documenting an isotope fractionation process during recrystallisation. Secondary calcite preferentially incorporates the lighter Sr isotope (86Sr) leaving pore waters isotopically heavy. The ??88/86Sr values of the carbonates themselves show more uniform values with no detectable change with depth. Carbonates have a much higher Sr content and total Sr inventory than the pore waters meaning pore waters are much more sensitive to fractionation processes than the carbonates. The ??88/86Sr results indicate that pore water stable Sr isotopes have the potential to indicate the recrystallisation of carbonate sediments.},

Here, recent progress in defining the evolution of global climate over the Cenozoic Era is reviewed.

abstract = {The main terminal processes of organic matter mineralization in anoxic Black Sea sediments underlying the sulfidic water column are sulfate reduction in the upper 2-4 m and methanogenesis below the sulfate zone. The modern marine deposits comprise a ca. 1-m-deep layer of coccolith ooze and underlying sapropel, below which sea water ions penetrate deep down into the limnic Pleistocene deposits from {\textgreater}9000 years BP. Sulfate reduction rates have a subsurface maximum at the SO4$\backslash$n2--CH4 transition where H2S reaches maximum concentration. Because of an excess of reactive iron in the deep limnic deposits, most of the methane-derived H2S is drawn downward to a sulfidization front where it reacts with Fe(III) and with Fe2+ diffusing up from below. The H2S-Fe2+ transition is marked by a black band of amorphous iron sulfide above which distinct horizons of greigite and pyrite formation occur. The pore water gradients respond dynamically to environmental changes in the Black Sea with relatively short time constants of ca. 500 yr for SO4$\backslash$n2- and 10 yr for H2S, whereas the FeS in the black band has taken ca. 3000 yr to accumulate. The dual diffusion interfaces of SO4$\backslash$n2--CH4 and H2S-Fe2+ cause the trapping of isotopically heavy iron sulfide with $\delta$34S = +15 to +33‰ at the sulfidization front. A diffusion model for sulfur isotopes shows that the SO4$\backslash$n2- diffusing downward into the SO4$\backslash$n2--CH4 transition has an isotopic composition of +19‰, close to the +23‰ of H2S diffusing upward. These isotopic compositions are, however, very different from the porewater SO4$\backslash$n2- (+43‰) and H2S (-15‰) at the same depth. The model explains how methane-driven sulfate reduction combined with a deep H2S sink leads to isotopically heavy pyrite in a sediment open to diffusion. These results have general implications for the marine sulfur cycle and for the interpretation of sulfur isotopic data in modern sediments and in sedimentary rocks throughout earth's history. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {STROMATOLITES are laminated, accretionary structures, which are commonly regarded to have formed by the sediment-binding or precipitating activities of ancient microbial mats or biofilms (composed mainly of cyanobacteria), possibly supplemented by abiotic surface precipitation. Stromatolites are thus considered to be a proxy for early life on Earth, as the record of these structures extends back to 3.5 Gyr ago But as stromatolites only rarely contain fossil microbes, their biogenicity is tacitly assumed on the basis of morphological comparisons with modern, demonstrably biological, structures Little is known about the physical, chemical and biological processes that controlled the growth of ancient stromatolites4 and, with pioneering exceptions7-9, the analysis of the inherent geometric characteristics of the structures has not been pursued. Here we present a morphological characterization of ancient stromatolites that have growth surfaces with self-affine fractal geometry. We deduce, from both the microscopic textures and the fractal dimension, a purely abiotic dynamical model of stromatolite surface growth that combines chemical precipitation on the growing interface, fallout and diffusive rearrangement of suspended sediment, and uncorrelated random noise.

abstract = {Large conodont samples have been collected from the uppermost Permian and lowermost Triassic (beds 24–29) at the Meishan section — the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the Permian–Triassic Boundary. This new information revises the ranges of some important conodont species in this section. For the first time, usable numbers of Neogondolella specimens have been found from the basal-most Triassic, enabling the establishment of parallel hindeodid and gondolellid zonations through the same section over this interval. In ascending order, the refined hindeodid zones are as follows: Hindeodus latidentatus Zone (bed 24a), Hindeodus praeparvus Zone (24b–26), Hindeodus changxingensis Zone (27a–b), Hindeodus parvus Zone (27c), Isarcicella staeschei Zone (27d–28), Isarcicella isarcica Zone (bed 29 and above). Three revised and newly established Neogondolella zones are proposed. In ascending order these are as follows: Neogondolella yini Zone (bed 24 and below), Neogondolella meishanensis Zone (25–26), Neogondolella taylorae Zone (27a and above). Neogondolella taylorae—a proposed earliest Triassic marker species, first appears in bed 27a, just below specimens of Hindeodus cf. parvus in bed 27b. Three successive conodont faunal assemblages are identified through the Permian–Triassic transitional interval.},

abstract = {The Earth experienced a severe mass extinction at the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) about 252 million years ago. This biological catastrophe was accompanied by major changes in geochemical composition of the atmosphere and ocean and the appearance of sedimentary features which had not occurred since the Precambrian time. The eruption of the largest continental flood basalt, the Siberian Traps, overlapped this mass killing. Many hypotheses have been proposed but no definitive conclusion currently exits. Here we present characteristics of three sections from Iran and China and propose that an active mantle plume initiated a series of processes which led to the mass mortality and produced major sedimentological, mineralogical, and geochemical changes observed in the transition from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic. The injection of mantle plume-related igneous dike swarms into the continental margin facilitated the release of massive amounts of CH4 primarily from the dissociation of marine gas hydrates and secondarily from the maturation of organic-rich sediments and fracturing of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The bulk of the CH4 was aerobically oxidized in the water column producing dissolved CO2 with low delta C-13 values. This CO2-saturated seawater became acidic to the point of dissolution of shelf carbonates promoting precipitation of siliciclasticrich strata in the transition from the Permian to the Triassic. Methane-derived CO2 also lowered carbon isotopic composition of seawater leading to the observed decline in delta C-13 composition of organic and inorganic marine carbon at the PTB. Gas-charged oceans released large volumes of CO2 and CH4 into the atmosphere which created a severe global warming (the end-Permian inferno) causing the release of additional CH4 from the dissociation of polar gas hydrates. These events lowered delta C-13 Compositions of terrestrial carbon. Simultaneously, feeder dikes from the mantle plume formed the Siberian Traps flood basalt. Marine mass extinction was the result of a change in seawater composition due to the injection and oxidation of CH4 in the water column causing low pH, high concentrations Of CO2, Ca2+ and HCO3-, and low CO32- U S. Combined with a hot seawater temperature, these changes made calcification of marine organisms difficult and produced major physiological crisis including reduced metabolic rates, high sensitivity to environmental stress, and hampered growth and reproduction. Terrestrial mass extinction can be attributed to severe global warming and soil acidification produced by increased atmospheric CO2, acid rain that was generated by SO2 derived from the Siberian trap eruption, and loss of habitat. Cessation of the plume activity during Early Triassic stopped the release of CH4 into the ocean and terminated continental flood basalt eruption ending the environment of death on land and in sea. The Cut off of CO2 production in the ocean instantly increased carbonate saturation of seawater resulting in extensive seafloor cementation. It also resulted in the deposition of marine carbonates by microbial activities in the hostile postextinction environment. From the trigger to recovery, the perturbation which included the end-Permian mass mortality could have lasted for at least 2 Myr. Several major mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic are temporally accompanied by flood basalt eruptions. So far, these two events have been interpreted in a cause-and-effect relation: flood basalt eruption causes mass extinction. This study proposes that flood basalts and their time correlative biological crises are themselves the consequence of a complex perturbation caused by mantle plume activities. If so, major disturbances in the near surface of the Earth are ultimately controlled by changes in the mantle. The physical sedimentological observations presented here combined with previous paleontological evidence cast doubt on other interpretations which use geochemical variables, numerical modeling, biomarkers, and Ce anomaly to suggest that Late Permian ocean was anoxic all the way to the photic zone.

Large oscillations of $\delta$13Corg between −36‰ and −15‰ from mean values of {\~{}} {\$}24\backslashpm 2{\$} in India, {\~{}} {\$}26\backslashpm 2{\$} in Madagascar, and {\~{}} {\$}23\backslashpm 2{\$} in South Africa occur before and after the P‐ T transition. The mean values are within the range of modern C3 plants ({\~{}}−25‰). The negative $\delta$13Corg spikes of the terrestrial plant remains complement similar spikes of smaller amplitude recorded globally in marine carbonates across the P‐ T boundary. Sensitivity analyses of carbon fluxes in a coupled atmosphere‐ ocean system indicate that the sharp declines in terrestrial and marine $\delta$13C can be explained by episodic release of methane from clathrates ({\~{}}−60‰) either directly into the atmosphere or via the oceans, possibly during the disintegration of the southern continental shelf of Tethys. The rapid increases in $\delta$13C may either signal aborted attempts of C4 plants ({\~{}}−13‰) to establish themselves at the expense of C3 plants or, more likely, reflect a punctuated increase in C3 biomass production related to elevated atmospheric CO2. Detection of a gradual negative trend in the Upper Permian and a similar positive recovery in the Lower Triassic, separated by up to three large negative $\delta$13C spikes across the P‐ T boundary in at least four terrestrial sections, caution against models of the end‐ Paleozoic biodiversity collapse and ensuing Mesozoic recovery based on a singular perturbation at the P‐ T boundary. Rather, these transitions may reflect multiple ecosystem stability states and abrupt responses during gradual forcing of a complex nonlinear system with thresholds.},

abstract = {Conodonts have the potential to elucidate the intricacies of Palaeozoic climates, especially if $\delta$18O values of single apatitic tooth-like ‘elements' can be used to map evolving sea surface temperatures and dif- ferentiate oceanic water masses. Their ecological distribution as pelagic and nektobenthic organisms, high- resolution biostratigraphy, and abundance in Cambrian–Triassic rocks qualifies them as potentially robust climate archives. Previous ion microprobe conodont $\delta$18O studies have proceeded directly to palaeotempera- ture interpretation without appreciation of inter- and intra-element variability or post-mortem artefacts. Here, ion microprobe analyses of Ordovician and Silurian conodonts establishes that: intra-element crown tissue $\delta$18O typically varies by ≤1‰ (53{\%} of conodonts analysed), is normally ≤2‰ (92{\%} of analyses), and rarely varies by 2–4‰; $\delta$18O can vary across elements, suggesting a microstructural and/or diagenetic control; $\delta$18O can vary between species representatives by c. 3‰; $\delta$18O of pelagic and nektobenthic taxa can be offset by 2–3‰; elements processed with formic acid have highly variable $\delta$18O; and thermal alteration does affect $\delta$18O. Conodont ion microprobe $\delta$18O values are comparable with those of bulk methods, but utilization of material with no consideration of geological context or processing history may introduce significant artefacts. A protocol for future conodont oxygen isotope ion microprobe studies is proposed.},

abstract = {Bulk and molecular stable C isotopic compositions and biomarker distributions provide evidence for a diverse community of algal and bacterial organisms in the sedimentary organic matter of a carbonate section throughout the Permian-Triassic (P/Tr) transition at the Idrijca Valley, Western Slovenia. The input of algae and bacteria in all the Upper Permian and Lower Scythian samples is represented by the predominance of C15-C22n-alkanes, odd C-number alkylcyclohexanes, C27steranes and substantial contents of C21-C30acyclic isoprenoids. The occurrence of odd long-chain n-alkanes (C22-C30) and C29steranes in all the samples indicate a contribution of continental material. The decrease of Corgand Ccarbcontents, increase of Rock-Eval oxygen indices, and13C-enrichment of the kerogen suggest a decrease in anoxia of the uppermost Permian bottom water. The predominance of odd C-number alkylcycloalkanes, C27steranes, and C17n-alkanes with $\delta$13C values ∼-30‰, and13C-enrichment of the kerogens in the lowermost Scythian samples are evidence of greater algal productivity. This increased productivity was probably sustained by a high nutrient availability and changes of dissolved CO2speciation associated to the earliest Triassic transgression. A decrease of Corgcontent in the uppermost Scythian samples, associated to a13C-depletetion in the carbonates (up to 4‰) and individual n-alkanes (up to 3.4‰) compared to the Upper Permian samples, indicate lowering of the primary productivity (algae, cyanobacteria) and/or higher degradation of the organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Reactions between reduced inorganic sulfur and organic compounds are thought to be important for the preservation of organic matter (OM) in sediments, but the sulfurization process is poorly understood. Sulfur isotopes are potentially useful tracers of sulfurization reactions, which often occur in the presence of a strong porewater isotopic gradient driven by microbial sulfate reduction. Prior studies of bulk sedimentary OM indicate that sulfurized products are 34S-enriched relative to coexisting sulfide, and experiments have produced 34S-enriched organosulfur compounds. However, analytical limitations have prevented the relationship from being tested at the molecular level in natural environments. Here we apply a new method, coupled gas chromatography - inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, to measure the compound-specific sulfur isotopic compositions of volatile organosulfur compounds over a 6m core of anoxic Cariaco Basin sediments. In contrast to current conceptual models, nearly all extractable organosulfur compounds were substantially depleted in 34S relative to coexisting kerogen and porewater sulfide. We hypothesize that this 34S depletion is due to a normal kinetic isotope effect during the initial formation of a carbon-sulfur bond and that the source of sulfur in this relatively irreversible reaction is most likely the bisulfide anion in sedimentary porewater. The 34S-depleted products of irreversible bisulfide addition alone cannot explain the isotopic composition of total extractable or residual OM. Therefore, at least two different sulfurization pathways must operate in the Cariaco Basin, generating isotopically distinct products. Compound-specific sulfur isotope analysis thus provides new insights into the timescales and mechanisms of OM sulfurization.},

abstract = {Significant amounts of SO42-, Na+, and OH- are incorporated in marine biogenic calcites. Biogenic high Mg-calcites average about 1 mole percent SO42-. Aragonites and most biogenic low Mg-calcites contain significant amounts of Na+, but very low concentrations of SO42-. The SO42- content of non-biogenic calcites and aragonites investigated was below 100 ppm. The presence of Na+ and SO42- increases the unit cell size of calcites. The solid-solutions show a solubility minimum at about 0.5 mole percent SO42- beyond which the solubility rapidly increases. The solubility product of calcites containing 3 mole percent SO42- is the same as that of aragonite. Na+ appears to have very little effect on the solubility product of calcites. The amounts of Na+ and SO42- incorporated in calcites vary as a function of the rate of crystal growth. The variation of the distribution coefficient (D) of SO42- in calcite at 25.0°C and 0.50 molal NaCl is described by the equation D = k0 + k1R where k0 and k1 are constants equal to 6.16 × 10-6 and 3.941 × 10-6, respectively, and R is the rate of crystal growth of calcite in mg{\textperiodcentered}min-1{\textperiodcentered}g-1 of seed. The data on Na+ are consistent with the hypothesis that a significant amount of Na+ occupies interstitial positions in the calcite structure. The distribution of Na+ follows a Freundlich isotherm and not the Berthelot-Nernst distribution law. The numerical value of the Na+ distribution coefficient in calcite is probably dependent on the number of defects in the calcite structure. The Na+ contents of calcites are not very accurate indicators of environmental salinities. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {Around half of world's endowment of in-place oil and bitumen experienced biodegradation, which is now believed to be largely an anaerobic methanogenic process. However, the distribution and scale of methanogenic biodegradation in the world's petroleum accumulations and the significance of its terminal product, secondary microbial methane, in the global gas endowment and carbon cycle are largely unknown. Here, I present geological and geochemical criteria to recognize secondary microbial methane in conventional petroleum reservoirs. These include the presence of biodegraded oil (as pools, legs or shows) in the reservoir or down-dip, the relatively dry (methane dominated) gas containing methane with $\delta$13C values between −55‰ and −35‰ and, most importantly, CO2 with $\delta$13C{\textgreater}+2‰. Based on these criteria, the presence of secondary microbial methane is apparent in 22 basins, probable in 12 basins and possible in six basins worldwide. Reservoirs apparently containing secondary microbial methane are mostly Cenozoic and clastic and occur at depths of 37–1834m below surface/mudline and temperatures of 12–71°C. Using the current global endowment of in-place oil and bitumen and reasonable assumptions about conversion of oil into methane during biodegradation, I estimated that ∼65,500tcf of secondary microbial methane could have been generated in existing worldwide accumulations of oil and bitumen through their geological history. From 1461–2760tcf in-place (845–1644tcf recoverable) of secondary microbial methane may be accumulated as free and oil-dissolved gas in petroleum reservoirs. I also updated the inventory of primary microbial methane and estimated that the global primary microbial gas endowment (free and oil-dissolved) is from 676–797tcf in-place (407–589tcf recoverable). Secondary microbial methane may account for ∼5–11{\%} of the global conventional recoverable gas endowment and appears more abundant than primary microbial gas (∼3–4{\%} of the global gas endowment). Most of the generated secondary microbial methane probably is aerobically and anaerobically oxidized to CO2 in the overburden above petroleum reservoirs. However, some secondary microbial methane may escape from shallow reservoirs into the atmosphere and affect present and past global climate.},

abstract = {The field of biomedical materials has grown rapidly over the past 20 years and offers solutions to repair defects, correct deformities, replace damaged tissue and provide therapy. This has contributed to the increase in the average lifetime of individuals in developed countries. The market value for biomaterials is of the order of billions of dollars per annum worldwide and is growing as new products offer improved performance or provide new solutions health problems. Apatites are playing a key role in biomedical implants. In developing materials used for implantation consideration must be given to both the influence of the implanted material on the body, and how the body affects the integrity of the material. The body will treat implants as inert, bioactive, or resorbable materials. Generally "inert" materials will evoke a physiological response to form a fibrous capsule, thus, isolating the material from the body. Calcium phosphates fall into the categories of bioactive and resorbable materials. A bioactive material will dissolve slightly, but promote the formation of an apatite layer before interfacing directly with the tissue at the atomic level. Such an implant will provide good stabilization for materials that are subject to mechanical loading. A bioresorbable material will, however, dissolve and allow tissue to grow into any surface irregularities but may not necessarily interface directly with the material (Neo et al. 1992). The first use of calcium phosphate as an implanted biomaterial provided accelerated bone healing in surgically created defects in rabbits (Albee and Morrison 1920). Interest in apatite specifically started in the 1960s and initial studies principally involved the synthesis and analysis of hydroxylapatites in an attempt to better understand biological apatites (Le Geros 1965, McConnell 1965, Nancollas and Mohan 1970, Selvig et al. 1970). Hydroxylapatite is a specific form of apatite with a chemical {\ldots}},

abstract = {The carbonate and phosphate vibrational modes of different synthetic and biological carbonated apatites were investigated by Raman microspectroscopy, and compared with those of hydroxyapatite. The n1 phosphate band at 960 cm−1 shifts slightly due to carbonate substitution in both A and B sites. The spectrum of type A carbonated apatite exhibits two n1 PO4 3− bands at 947 and 957 cm−1. No significant change was observed in the n2 and n4 phosphate mode regions in any carbonated samples. The n3 PO4 3− region seems to be more affected by carbonation: two main bands were observed, as in the hydroxyapatite spectrum, but at lower wave numbers. The phosphate spectra of all biominerals apatite were consistent with type AB carbonated apatite. In the enamel spectrum, bands were observed at 3513 and at 3573 cm−1 presumably due to two different hydroxyl environments. Two different bands due to the carbonate n1 mode were identified depending on the carbonate substitution site A or B, at 1107 and 1070 cm−1, respectively. Our results, compared with the infrared data already reported, suggest that even low levels of carbonate substitution induce modifications of the hydroxyapatite spectrum. Increasing substitution ratios, however, do not bring about any further alteration. The spectra of dentine and bone showed a strong similarity at a micrometric level. This study demonstrates the existence of acidic phosphate, observable by Raman microspectrometry, in mature biominerals. The HPO4 2− and CO3 2− contents increase from enamel to dentine and bone, however, these two phenomena do not seem to be correlated.},

abstract = {Over the next few centuries, with unabated emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), a total of 5000 Pg C may enter the atmosphere, causing CO2 concentrations to rise to approximately 2000 ppmv, global temperature to warm by more than 8(°)C and surface ocean pH to decline by approximately 0.7 units. A carbon release of this magnitude is unprecedented during the past 56 million years-and the outcome accordingly difficult to predict. In this regard, the geological record may provide foresight to how the Earth system will respond in the future. Here, we discuss the long-term legacy of massive carbon release into the Earth's surface reservoirs, comparing the Anthropocene with a past analogue, the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, approx. 56 Ma). We examine the natural processes and time scales of CO2 neutralization that determine the atmospheric lifetime of CO2 in response to carbon release. We compare the duration of carbon release during the Anthropocene versus PETM and the ensuing effects on ocean acidification and marine calcifying organisms. We also discuss the conundrum that the observed duration of the PETM appears to be much longer than predicted by models that use first-order assumptions. Finally, we comment on past and future mass extinctions and recovery times of biotic diversity.},

abstract = {The effects of pH and phosphate on the precipitation of calcium carbonate polymorphs from aqueous solution were investigated. Experiments were carried out at near-freezing temperature and two different pH conditions (pH 13.4 and 9.0). At each pH condition, solutions having different concentrations of CaCl2 and NaHCO3 were mixed to achieve Ca/CO3 ratios of 1:1 and 10:1 at different pumping rates with and without phosphate. Results showed that, at pH 13.4, only ikaite was formed, independent of pumping rate, Ca/CO3 ratio, and phosphate. At pH 9.0, the precipitate was predominantly vaterite in the absence of phosphate and ikaite in the presence of phosphate regardless of the ratio of Ca/CO3. These results indicate that at low temperatures and moderate alkaline conditions (pH 9.0), phosphate can act as a switch between ikaite and vaterite polymorphs. Contrastingly, at higher alkaline conditions (pH 13.4) phosphate is not prerequisite and the high pH in itself is enough to trigger ikaite formation over vaterite.},

abstract = {The early Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (Early Jurassic;{\~{}}183Myr ago) is associated with one of the largest negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) in the whole Phanerozoic (3-7{\%}). Estimates of the magnitude and rate of CO2injection in the ocean-atmosphere system are compatible with a scenario of ocean acidification. Many carbonate platforms drowned in the Pliensbachian, well before the early Toarcian event. In this paper we test the hypothesis of surface water ocean acidification by presenting data from a resilient carbonate platform: the Apennine Carbonate Platform of southern Italy.The studied sections document a dramatic shift of the carbonate factory from massive biocalcification to chemical precipitation. Lithiotis bivalves and calcareous algae (Palaeodasycladus mediterraneus), which were the most prolific carbonate producers of Pliensbachian carbonate platforms, disappear during the first phase of the early Toarcian CIE, before the most depleted values are reached. We discuss the local versus supraregional significance of this shift and propose a scenario involving abrupt decline of carbonate saturation, forced by CO2release at the beginning of the early Toarcian CIE, followed by a calcification overshoot, driven by the recovery of ocean alkalinity. Attribution of the demise of carbonate platform hypercalcifiers to ocean acidification is supported by palaeophysiology and reinforced by experimental data on the detrimental effects of ocean acidification on recent shellfishes and calcareous algae. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Intrusion of a diabase sill into the Paleoproterozoic Kuruman Iron Formation, Transvaal Basin, South Africa makes it possible to distinguish between effects of contact and regional metamorphism on mineralogic, elemental and isotopic compositions of banded iron-formation (BIF) lithofacies. Temperatures within the aureole of contact metamorphism likely did not significantly exceed 450°C as suggested by the presence of early diagenetic carbonates, greenalite, and stilpnomelane (formed prior to intrusion) in chert-rich facies as close as 4 m from the sill. In sediments 32 m away from the intrusion, a temperature of {\~{}} 280°C is indicated by the magnitude of 180 fractionation between successive chert and siderite microbands; in unmetamorphosed equivalents similar isotopic analyses on whole-rock samples yield temperature estimates between 150 and 230°C. In comparison with samples of similar lithofacies from the underlying Campbellrand-Kuruman transition zone, carbonates from within the metamorphic aureole are depleted in 13C and 180. The abundance and C-isotopic composition of total organic C (TOC) in whole-rock samples is lower and more enriched in 13C than those in samples outside of the zone of contact metamorphism. Within 5 m of the diabase sill the abundance of Fe increases dramatically and the oxidation state of the sediments fluctuates considerably more than in sediments outside of the metamorphic aureole. Isotopic and mineralogic systematics in the zone of contact metamorphism in the Kuruman Iron Formation are similar to those in siliceous dolomites and limestones altered by similar thermal processes. As the most distinct isotopic and elemental variations occur within 10 m of the diabase sill, it is suggested that volatilization and fluid infiltration associated with the intrusion were the main processes of alteration. Consideration of the effects of metamorphism (both contact and regional) as well as early diagenesis on the mineralogy and isotopic chemistry of BIF sediments may be a key to our understanding of primary mineralogies and oxidation state of these enigmatic deposits.},

They are also the main silica ex-porter to the deep sea, thus balancing global chemical weath-ering. This study reviews their global Cenozoic depositional pattern in order to understand the modality and the con-text of their rise to dominance, but also to understand how diatom evolution affected the Cenozoic functioning of the ocean's biological pump. After two short-lived major abun-dance peaks near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary and in the late Oligocene, diatom abundance in sediments shifted in the middle Miocene to globally higher values which have largely persisted to the modern day. These quantitative findings pro-vide support for the hypothesis according to which diatoms, through their ecological role in the ocean's biological carbon pump, have contributed to the Cenozoic changes in atmo-spheric carbon dioxide pressure and consequently to changes in the global climate state. Additionally, correlations between diatom abundance peaks and shifts in seawater strontium and osmium isotopic composition hint at a strong control of the silicate weathering on diatom deposition.},

These include a maximum isotopic fractionation around -51per mille sign which appears to be constant throughout the entire Phanerozoic. Observable large spreads of delta34Ssulfide for any given sedimentary unit are caused by environmental parameters, such as type and availability of organic carbon or availability of sulfate. In particular, the growing importance of land plants and their impact on the amount of metabolizable organic substrate affects the sulfide sulfur isotopic composition.},

abstract = {The stability of magnesian calcites was reexamined, and new results are presented for 28 natural inorganic, 12 biogenic, and 32 synthetic magnesian calcites. The magnesian calcite solid-solutions were separated into two groups on the basis of differences in stoichiometric solubility and other physical and chemical properties. Group I consists of solids of mainly metamorphic and hydrothermal origin, synthetic calcites prepared at high temperatures and pressures, and synthetic solids prepared at low temperature and very low calcite supersaturations (??calcite ??? 1.5) from artificial sea water or NaClMgCl2CaCl2 solutions. Group I solids are essentially binary s of CaCO2 and MgCO2, and are thought to be relatively free of structural defects. Group II solid-solutions are of either biogenic origin or are synthetic magnesian calcites and protodolomites (0-20 and ??? 45 mole percent MgCO3) prepared at high calcite supersaturations (??calcite??? 3) from NaClNa2SO4MgCl2CaCl2 or NaClMgCl2CaCl2 solutions. Group II solid-solutions are treated as massively defective solids. The defects include substitution foreign ions (Na+ and SO42-) in the magnesian calcite lattice (point defects) and dislocations ({\~{}}2 ?? 109 cm-2). Within each group, the excess free energy of mixing, GE, is described by the mixing model ge = X(1- x)[A0 + A1(2x - 1)], where x is the mole fraction of the end-member Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3 in the solid-solution. The values of A0 and A1 for Group I and II solids were evaluated at 25??C. The equilibrium constants of all the solids are closely described by the equation ln Kx = x(1-x) RT[A0 + A1(2x- 1)]+ (1 - x) ln [KC(1- x)]+ x ln (KDx), where KC and KD are the equilibrium constants of calcite and Ca0.5Mg0.5CO3. Group I magnesian calcites were modeled as sub-regular solid-solutions between calcite and dolomite, and between calcite and "disordered dolomite". Both models yield almost identical equilibrium constants for these magnesian calcites. The Group II magnesian calcites were modeled as sub-regular solid-solutions between defective calcite and protodolomite. Group I and II solid-solutions differ significantly in stability. The rate of crystal growth and the chemical composition of the aqueous solutions from which the solids were formed are the main factors controlling stoichiometric solubility of the magnesian calcites and the density of crystal defects. The literature on the occurrence and behavior of magnesian calcites in sea water and other aqueous solutions is also examined. ?? 1989.},

Except for polythionates formed during sulphide oxidation by T. concretivorus or Chromatium sp., the products of metabolism were enriched in 32S relative to the starting substrates. The magnitudes of the enrichment differed for different processes and for the same overall process carried out by different organisms. The {\{}delta{\}}34S values ({\%}0) ranged from -46{\{}middle dot{\}}0 for sulphide from sulphate reduction by Desulfovibrio desulfuricans to +19{\{}middle dot{\}}0 for polythionate formed during growth on sulphide by T. concretivorus. Fractionation during sulphate reduction was inversely proportional to rate of reduction when lactate and ethanol were electron donors and directly proportional with molecular hydrogen as the electron donor. Temperature and sulphate concentration, within the normal physiological ranges of these parameters, influenced fractionation only in so far as they influenced rate of reduction. However, anomalous fractionation effects were obtained at low temperatures and when a resting suspension reducing sulphite was subjected to changes in temperature. The data are discussed with reference to the mechanism(s) of fractionation.},

abstract = {High-resolution stratigraphic records through the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) interval of the global stratotype section and point (GSSP) at Meishan, Zhejiang Province, China reveal that the PTB crisis was not a single, abrupt catastrophe. A bed-by-bed analysis of environmental and biotic changes makes clear that the crisis can be resolved into two discrete episodes, each consisting of three stages: A) unstably oscillating conditions, B) peak crisis conditions, and C) ameliorating conditions. The first crisis episode commenced in Bed 23, peaked in Beds 24e-26, and ameliorated in Beds 27 and 28, while the second crisis episode commenced in Bed 29, peaked in Beds 34-38, and ameliorated in Beds 39 and higher. The macroscopic mass extinctions happened not at the beginning, nor the end of each cycle, but at times when the crisis or perturbation of environments began. These extinction events do not show detectable feedbacks to concurrent environmental changes. In each episode, cyanobacteria proliferation postdated the macroscopic extinction while proliferation of green sulfur bacteria predated the environmental crisis. Causational analysis between environmental and microbial changes show that geomicrobial functional groups exercised pronounced effects on the marine C-N-S cycles and ocean redox conditions during the PTB crisis. It is possible thus that the microbial crises played an important role in strengthening or evening triggering the environmental crisis. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper documents a new Permian-Triassic carbonate sequence which recorded the end-Permian mass extinction in the isolated oceanic setting of Neotethys in southwestern Tibet, China. The sequence is over 350m thick and consists of the Gyanyima and the Lower Lanchengquxia formations in ascending order. The Lopingian (Late Permian) Gyanyima Formation is composed of fossiliferous reddish carbonates dominated by Colaniella grainstone and reef facies including fenestrate/sponge/coral framestone and bafflestone. 156 species are recognized from the Lopingian Gyanyima Formation. Composite ranges of brachiopods, ostracods, rugose corals and foraminifers at the Gyanyima Section suggest that evolution and diversification of Permian marine organisms continued to the end-Permian preceding a major faunal extinction close to the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB), coincident with a 2-3??? negative shift of ??13Ccarb. The timing and accelerating extinction pattern and the negative ??13Ccarb excursion are largely comparable with those reported from many previously-documented sections on continental shelf environments.Based on a detailed lithofacies analysis, the latest Permian reefal facies is sharply replaced by ostracod/crinoid packstone/grainstone with abrupt abundant occurrences of Early Triassic conodonts at the Gyanyima Section. This is then followed by thrombolitic microbialite, stromatolite, packstone containing abundant spherical microbes, and bivalve/ammonoid packstone of tidal and intertidal facies. This distinct lithofacies and biofacies shift would, therefore, suggest a dramatic faunal community and environmental change across the PTB. Distinct palaeoclimate fluctuations through the P-T interval are also indicated by the alternation of warm- and cool-water faunas through the uppermost part of the succession. The lower part of the Gyanyima Formation is characterized by a warm condition as indicated by Cathaysian-dominated fossils. This was then followed by a mild cooling event as suggested by the occurrence of many distinct peri-Gondwanan elements and absence of compound corals. The latest Changhsingian is characterized exclusively by warm-water faunal elements of Cathaysian affinities, together with the negative shift of ??13Ccarb, suggesting a rapid warming event at the very end of Permian in association with much more widespread volcanic activities than we thought before. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The mineralogies of most biotic and abiotic carbonates have alternated in synchroneity between the calcite (hexagonal) and aragonite (orthorhombic) polymorphs of CaCO3 throughout the Phanerozoic Eon. These intervals of calcite and aragonite production, or calcite seas and aragonite seas, are thought to be caused primarily by secular variation in the molar magnesium/calcium ratio of seawater (mMg/Ca {\textgreater} 2 = aragonite + high-Mg calcite; mMg/Ca {\textless} 2 = low-Mg calcite), a ratio that has oscillated between 1.0 and 5.2 throughout the Phanerozoic. In laboratory experiments, we show that three species of scleractinian corals, which produce aragonite in modern seawater and which have flourished as important reef builders primarily during aragonite seas of the past, began producing calcite in artificial seawater with an ambient mMg/Ca ratio below that of modern seawater (5.2). The corals produced progressively higher percentages of calcite and calcified at lower rates with further reduction of the ambient mMg /Ca ratio. In artificial seawater of imputed Late Cretaceous composition (mMg/Ca = 1.0), which favors the precipitation of the calcite polymorph, scleractinian corals produced skeletons containing {\textgreater}30{\%} low-Mg calcite (skeletal mMg/Ca {\textless} 0.04). These results indicate that the skeletal mineral used by scleractinian corals is partially determined by seawater chemistry. Furthermore, slow calcification rates, resulting from the production of largely aragonitic skeletons in chemically unfavorable seawater (mMg/Ca {\textless} 2), probably contributed to the scleractinians' diminished reef-building role in the calcite seas of Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic time. {\textcopyright} 2006 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Diversity dynamics of the PermianTriassic land plants in South China are studied by analyzing paleobotanical data. Our results indicate that the total diversity of land-plant megafossil genera and species across the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB) of South China underwent a progressive decline from the early Late Permian (Wuchiapingian) to the Early-Middle Triassic. In contrast, the diversity of land-plant microfossil genera exhibited only a small fluctuation across the PTB of South China, showing an increase at the PTB. Overall, land plants across the PTB of South China show a greater stability in diversity dynamics than marine faunas. The highest extinction rate (90.91{\%}) and the lowest origination rate (18.18{\%}) of land-plant megafossil genera occurred at the early Early Triassic (Induan), but the temporal duration of the higher genus extinction rates ({\textgreater}60{\%}) in land plants was about 23.4 Myr, from the Wuchiapingian to the early Middle Triassic (Anisian), which is longer than that of the coeval marine faunas (3-11 Myr). Moreover, the change of genus turnover rates in land-plant megafossils steadily fluctuated from the late Early Permian to the Late Triassic. More stable diversity and turnover rate as well as longer extinction duration suggest that land plants near the PTB of South China may have been involved in a gradual floral reorganization and evolutionary replacement rather than a mass extinction like those in the coeval marine faunas. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Paleontological Society.

abstract = {Ocean stagnation has been invoked to explain the widespread occurrence of organic-carbon-rich, laminated sediments interpreted to have been deposited under anoxic bottom waters at the time of the end-Permian mass extinction. However, to a first approximation, stagnation would severely reduce the upwelling supply of nutrients to the photic zone, reducing productivity. Moreover, it is not obvious that ocean stagnation can be achieved. Numerical experiments performed with st three-dimensional global ocean model linked to a biogeochemical model of phosphate and oxygen cycling indicate that a low equator to pole temperature gradient could have produced weak oceanic circulation and widespread anoxia in the Late Permian ocean. We find that polar warming and tropical cooling of sea-surface temperatures cause anoxia throughout the deep ocean as a result of both lower dissolved oxygen in bottom source waters and increased nutrient utilization. Buildup of quantities of H2S and CO2 in the Late Permian ocean sufficient to directly cause a mass extinction, however, would have required large increases in the oceanic nutrient inventory.},

abstract = {Based on present knowledge of the purely chemical controls on the kinetics of massive dolomite formation, the abundance and distribution of dolomite throughout the Phanerozoic remains an enigma, sometimes referred to as the 'dolomite problem'. Comparing dolomite abundance to secular variation in seawater chemistry indicates that some changes in seawater chemistry are more likely to have resulted from extensive dolomitization rather than to have caused it. The recently formulated microbial dolomite model provides the opportunity to view the geological history of dolomite formation from a new perspective. A biogeochemical approach to the 'dolomite problem' reveals a plausible connection between Phanerozoic geochemical cycles and dolomite formation. In particular, periods of more extensive dolomitization broadly correlate with diverse indicators of decreased oxygen levels in the atmosphere and oceans. Lowered oxygen levels would have fostered a more active community of anaerobic microbes, including sulphate-reducing bacteria, which in turn could have led to more extensive dolomitization of marine carbonates.},

abstract = {Since the establishment of astrochronology, calcareous rhythmites are frequently used as the basis of high-resolution chronostratigraphy. In particular for the Neogene, calcareous rhythmites serve as stratotypes and for absolute dating of stratigraphic boundaries (Global Stratotype Sections and Points -GSSPs). However, the exact mechanisms responsible for the formation of the rhythmic intercalation of lithologies in such successions are complex and not easily reconstructed. To a large extent this is the effect of diagenetic modifications of the original sediment. Here, two examples of Neogene calcareous rhythmites are studied; the Monte dei Corvi section and the Monte Gibliscemi section. The first is the GSSP location of the Serravallian-Tortonian boundary, whereas the second is an auxiliary stratotype for the same boundary. During the past years, astrochronological approaches were applied to these successions to considerably increase time resolution compared to the elaborated biostratigraphic database. The present study focuses on micropetrographic, trace element and clay mineralogical methods in order to gain a better understanding of the genesis of the rhythmites. In the Monte Gibliscemi section, sediment parameters that are robust against diagenetic change clearly reflect primary differences, i.e. cyclical environmental changes. In contrast, no clear primary signal is determined for the Monte dei Corvi section on a couplet scale, leaving the origin of the rhythm ambiguous. This impedes the interpretation of the latter and the comparability between the two successions, and also compromises any bed-by-bed correlation between the two. The unclear origin of the rhythmites of Monte dei Corvi introduces uncertainty into the applicability of astrochronology to this succession. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 The Lethaia Foundation.},

abstract = {The chemical weathering of Ca-Mg silicate rocks is the principal process whereby CO2 is removed from the atmosphere on long or multimillion-year time scales. At present vascular land plants exert an important influence on weathering by recycling water and by bringing about the secretion of acids and the buildup of high levels of CO2 in soils. Before the spread of vascular plants on the continents during the mid-Paleozoic, chemical weathering must have been achieved by higher levels of atmospheric CO2 and/or by the intercession of primitive land biota such as lichens and cyanobacteria. From examination of several pre-vascular weathering scenarios, it is concluded that in order to prohibit unreasonably high levels of atmospheric CO2, weathering during the Precambrian and early Paleozoic must have taken place under essentially closed-system abiotic conditions (linear feedback) or via strong regulation by primitive biota. Preliminary examination of modern weathering by lichens over tens to thousands of years militates against the latter possibility. However, much more work needs to be done on the quantitative effect of both primitive biota and vascular plants on the rate of weathering (and their response to changes in atmospheric CO2) before anything more definitive can be said. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Two petrographic settings of carbonaceous components, mainly filling open fractures and occasionally enclosed in shock-melt veins, were found in the recently fallen Tissint Martian meteorite. The presence in shock-melt veins and the deuterium enrichments (dDupto +1183{\&}) of these components clearly indicate a pristine Martian origin. The carbonaceous components are kerogen-like, based on micro-Raman spectra and multielemental ratios, and were probably deposited from fluids in shock-induced fractures in the parent rock of Tissint. After precipitation of the organic matter, the rock experienced another severe shock event, producing the melt veins that encapsulated a part of the organic matter. The C isotopic compositions of the organic matter (d13C = ?12.8 to ?33.1{\&}) are significantly lighter than Martian atmospheric CO2 and carbonate, providing a tantalizing hint for a possible biotic process. Alternatively, the organic matter could be derived from carbonaceous chondrites, as insoluble organic matter from the latter has similar chemical and isotopic compositions. The presence of organic-rich fluids that infiltrated rocks near the surface of Mars has significant implications for the study of Martian paleoenvironment and perhaps to search for possible ancient biological activities on Mars.

abstract = {Palynological investigations of Rhaetian outcrops and drillcores in combination with subsurface data from wells in Scania, southern Sweden, have revealed the presence of marine dinoflagellate cysts in sedimentary strata that were previously considered to have been deposited in a mainly terrestrial environment. Two distinct dinocyst events are identified. One older event where persistent, rare to common occurrences of Rhaetogonyaulax rhaetica and Lunnomidinium scaniense indicates deposition in shallow marine and marginal marine environments. This Lunnomidinium interval is preceded and succeeded by assemblages with rare to common R. rhaetica, and can be correlated with the mid to late Rhaetian R. rhaetica Zone. It is associated with spore/pollen assemblages of the mid Rhaetian Rhaetipollis-Limbosporites Zone. The younger event, the R. rhaetica maximum interval, is characterised by mass-occurrence of R. rhaetica, with less common or absent Dapcodinium priscum, in association with a dark grey to black mudstone/shale. The introduction of D. priscum in association with the over-whelming abundance of R. rhaetica allows correlation with the transition between the R. rhaetica Zone and the succeeding D. priscum Zone, and signals fully marine conditions. The R. rhaetica maximum interval is associated with spore/pollen assemblages of the late Rhaetian Ricciisporites-Polypodiisporites Zone, and is in Sweden succeeded both lithostratigraphically and palynostratigraphically by the T-J transition. The R. rhaetica maximum interval corresponds to a late Rhaetian maximum flooding event that took place in a shallow, gently sloping embayment that covered the Danish Basin area during the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. This maximum flooding event can be recognised in late Rhaetian strata from different parts of the Northern Hemisphere. It is an important temporal constraint on the T-J boundary as it is associated with the disappearance of Triassic marine faunas, appears to coincide with the onset of the main pulse of CAMP volcanism, immediately precedes the initial carbon isotope excursion and the global sea-level drop that characterises the T-J transition. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The new dataset of the carbon and oxygen stable isotope values across the sedimentary sequence of the Changhsingian Stage at Meishan, south China documents the carbon biogeochemical cycle in detail. The cycle began with storage of organic carbon (Corg), mainly as biogenic carbon dioxide in clathrates, and carbon dioxide from anaeorobic methane oxidation (AMO) in the stratified sea water masses, which is reflected by a rapid increase in the $\delta$13C values. Storage of Corg demanded a large biomass productivity, and thus consumption of a vast amount of carbon dioxide, which would have been associated with climatic oceanic water cooling. Oceanic water cooling and enhanced volcanism is actually reflected by a gradual increase in the $\delta$18O values. The longterm stasis between Corg burial and reburial was then achieved, as reflected by the stable course of the $\delta$13C curve. At the same time, cool water circulation caused a continuous increase in the $\delta$18O values. At the end of the cycle, several factors including earthquakes and other tectonic movements marking the onset of major Siberian volcanism, together with a local temperature increase resulted in a change of ocean circulation, caused mixing of stratified sea water masses. This was followed by destruction of the existing clathrates, degassing of carbon dioxide, oxidation of organic matter, and a rapid decrease in the oceanic $\delta$13C values. Apart from the carbon dioxide that was released to the atmosphere, part of the methane must have been oxidised, creating additional carbon dioxide as well as water vapour. The carbon dioxide and water vapour must have initiated a greenhouse effect and caused thermal stratification of seawater which, in turn, initiated reconstruction of the redox in the Early Triassic. The end of the cycle was associated with the end-Permian mass extinction. The global warming associated with methane release from clathrates led to collapse of terrestrial plants. At the same time, the mixing event brought methane and organic matter for oxidation, which caused massive consumption of oxygen and extinction of the terrestrial fauna. In the marine environment, the mixing event brought water masses rich in carbon dioxide, as well as excess hydrogen ions from anoxic zones, onto shelf areas, causing a collapse of marine biota. The carbon biogeochemical cycle of the Changhsingian indicated by the initial rapid rise, long-term stasis, and final rapid drop in $\delta$13C values, seems to be a rule for a pattern of Phanerozoic $\delta$13C values in sedimentary carbonates. This suggests that a process of methane storage and release may have had a bearing on major geochemical perturbations throughout Earth history. However, methane storage, with or without the association of carbon dioxide and other forms of Corg, and its subsequent release, could have occurred in many different scenarios throughout the Phanerozoic, Therefore, the end of the carbon cycles may be associated with mass extinction only when release of methane is coupled with other phenomena, which is the case with the end-Permian event.},

Geochemical indicators sensitive to the influence of extraterrestrial material involve platinum group elements and osmium and helium isotope ratios.

abstract = {Carbonate clumped isotope thermometry is a relatively new paleotemperature proxy based on measurements of the degree of ordering of13C and18O into bonds with each other (making the13C18O16O2-2ion group) in lattices of carbonate minerals. This technique has several unusual properties that complement existing methods of paleoclimate reconstruction. Most importantly, it is based on a homogeneous isotope exchange equilibrium and thus constrains temperature independent of the isotopic composition of waters from which carbonates grew. This method also appears to be generally insensitive to 'vital effects' that compromise many other paleothermometers based on the chemical properties of biominerals or organic matter, at least for those organisms that have been subjected to systematic study to-date (corals and foraminifera); however, discrepancies among some calibrations, particularly at low temperatures, may point toward the existence of vital effects in mollusks and other organisms. This review discusses the principles and calibrations of the technique, its uses in combination with conventional stable isotope measurements to constrain the $\delta$18O of past waters, preservation of paleotemperatures in ancient materials, as well as current problems in our understanding of calibrations and interlaboratory data comparisons. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The isotopic composition of sulphur has been determined for a large number of specimens representing the important geochemical phases in which sulphur is present. The most significant process that causes sulphur isotopic fractionation is the reduction of dissolved sulphate by bacteria, although other processes such as distillation of volcanic emanations, oxidation-reduction of H2S, SO2 and S during volcanism and sulphide-sulphate equilibrium under magmatie or hydrothermal conditions can be locally important. The new data are combined with earlier work in an attempt to define the range and average S32/S34 ratio of the various sulphur-bearing phases of the crust. The most important averages are meteorites 22.21, ocean sulphate 21.76, mafic rocks 22.16, plutonic silicic rocks 22.13, hydrothermal sulphides 22.13 and sedimentary sulphide 22.49 and post-Cambrian evaporite sulphate 21.80. A material balance calculation of the sulphur isotopes in the crust, although subject to considerable uncertainties, points to an average crustal composition of sulphur heavier than that for meteorites. No age effect is found for at least the last 2 × 109 years. Finally, a geochemical theory is described to account for the apparent distribution of sulphur isotopes in the lithosphere.},

abstract = {Rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) have a distinct distribution pattern in seawater, and this pattern may be faithfully preserved in carbonate sediments and rocks. Anomalous concentrations of redox-sensitive cerium (Ce) compared with neighbouring REY originate in oxic water column conditions, and as such, Ce anomalies can provide a potentially useful redox proxy in carbonate-dominated marine settings. The methods used to extract REY from carbonates vary widely, and may suffer from widespread leaching of REY from accessory non-carbonate minerals and organic matter, limiting the application of Ce anomalies for palaeo-redox reconstruction. We have systematically compared different methods on 195 carbonate samples with varying purity ({\%} carbonate) from both modern and ancient environments. We used sequential leaching experiments in nitric acid to identify the most ‘seawater-like' portion of the carbonate sample where contributions from non-carbonate minerals and organic matter are minimised. We also compared the results of sample dissolution in different types and strengths of acid. Our results confirm that REY concentrations can be inadvertently contaminated by partial leaching of clays and Fe (oxyhydr)oxides during a single-step digestion, and we suggest a pre-leach of 20{\%} of the sample, followed by a partial leach of 40{\%} of the sample to selectively dissolve carbonate. We suggest that REY studies are optimised in carbonates with {\textgreater} 85{\%} CaCO3, and show that dolomites behave differently during the leaching process and must be treated separately. We present REY patterns for modern carbonate-rich sediments from a range of environments, and show that seawater REY are faithfully preserved in some non-skeletal carbonate, but modified leaching procedures are necessary for impure, unlithified or organic rich carbonate sediments. We combine REY with Fe-speciation data to identify how Fe oxides and clays contribute to the REY signal and explore how the two proxies can be used together to provide a complex and high-resolution redox reconstruction in carbonate-dominated marine environments.},

abstract = {Hemipelagic sediments from the northeastern Arabian Sea off Pakistan were analyzed by geochemical and microscopical methods to study the importance of bacterial degradation processes on the quantity and composition of sedimentary organic matter (OM). On the basis of elemental analysis of total organic carbon (TOC) and total sulfur (TS), the decay of OM by sulfate-reducing bacteria were calculated. Concentrations of total iron, reactive iron, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP) and hydrogen indices (HI) were used to assess organic matter reactivity and redox conditions. Stable sulfur isotopic compositions provided further information about pathway, timing and mechanisms of sulfate reduction. Microscopical observations indicate that throughout the study area, OM is amorphous (75–95{\%}) in almost all samples with only a small contribution of terrigenous OM. Bacterially mediated sulfate reduction leads to continuously decreasing TOC/TS ratios from 0.4 m to a burial depth of 2–3 m. At this depth, the anaerobic oxidation of particulate organic matter ceases. Sulfate reduction in this narrow interval accounts for the decay of up to 70{\%} of the OM which has primarily entered the anoxic domain. During the bacterially mediated diagenesis preferential consumption of nitrogen and phosphorus containing organic compounds can be observed and quantified. The regeneration of up to 60{\%} of TN and more than 50{\%} of TP can lead to a feedback of nutrients to the seawater. This recycling process may contribute to the high productivity in the northeastern Arabian Sea.},

abstract = {Carbonate concretions are widespread within the geological record. However, the lack of recent known analogues creates a need for novel approaches to unravel the major microbial players involved in concretion formation and establish their suitability as palaeoenvironmental recorders. Here, we used a combination of geochemical and geological techniques to study two pyritiferous calcite concretions and compared the results with their host sediment (Toarcian "Posidonia Shale", 183 Ma, SW-Germany).The13C-depleted nature of the concretion bodies, with average values of $\delta$13Ccarb(-14.8‰), $\delta$13Corg(-32.4‰), and $\delta$13Cn-alkanes(-34.9‰), indicates that sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), played a major role in the concretion growth and preservation of the nucleus via the rapid decomposition of organic matter (OM). However, Rock-Eval analyses from both concretions revealed elevated hydrogen indices (HI) in the body and low HI values at the rim. These values suggest that most of the microbial activity did not occur in the concretion body but rather at the rim and at the surface of the nuclei, which generally supports the exceptional preservation of OM in carbonate concretions. Furthermore, enrichment in euhedral pyrite in the concretion rims suggests they were formed through increased activities of iron reducing (FeR) bacteria coupled to a decrease of SRB activity leading towards conditions more favourable to the direct precipitation of pyrite. Despite low $\delta$13C values, the known lipid biomarkers such as acyclic extended isoprenoids or 3$\beta$-methyl-hopanes did not reveal evidence of an active methane cycling. The present study emphasises the crucial role of carbonate concretion in OM preservation and highlights their great potential as palaeoenvironmental recorders.},

abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950-2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

abstract = {One of the most important carbon cycle perturbations following the end-Permian mass extinction event straddles the Smithian-Spathian boundary (SSB) (Olenekian, Early Triassic). This anomaly is characterized by a prominent positive carbon isotope excursion known from Tethyan marine rocks. Its global significance is established here by a new high paleolatitude record (Spitsbergen). Paleontological evidence, such as Boreal palynological data (Barents Sea, Norway) and global patterns of ammonoid distribution, indicates a synchronous major change in terrestrial and marine ecosystems near the SSB. The reestablishment of highly diverse plant ecosystems, including the rise of woody gymnosperms and decline of the formerly dominating lycopods, is interpreted as an effect of a major climate change. This hypothesis is supported by modeling of ammonoid paleobiogeography, the distribution patterns of which are interpreted as a proxy for sea surface temperatures (SST). The latest Smithian thus appears to have been a time of a warm and equable climate as expressed by an almost flat pole to equator SST gradient. In contrast, the steep Spathian SST gradient suggests latitudinally differentiated climatic conditions. We propose that this drastic climate change and the global carbon cycle perturbation were triggered by a massive end-Smithian CO2 injection. The SSB event could therefore represent one of the causes for stepwise and delayed recovery of marine and terrestrial biotas in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis.},

abstract = {In the Toarcian (Early Jurassic; {\~{}}183Myr ago), the ocean-atmosphere system was subject to one of the largest perturbations of the carbon cycle in the last 250Myr known as the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE). This event was accompanied by a -6??? negative carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) caused by massive injection of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system, possibly from destabilisation of gas hydrates. This study reveals the pacing and sequence of events leading up to the CIE and to widespread deposition of organic-rich sediments. The very high-resolution isotopic record from exceptionally well-preserved carbonate and organic matter from the Paris Basin enables recognition of increased CO 2 levels {\~{}}130kyr in advance of the major negative CIE. An accelerated increase in the pCO 2 is registered {\~{}}25kyr before the onset of this negative excursion and was so rapid and so intense that it led to a water column undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate in the Paris Basin. Undersaturation is expressed as a dramatic drop in the accumulation of the biogenic calcite produced by the surface-dwelling calcifiers. These environmental perturbations, representing precursor phases of CO 2 injection, predate the first step towards relatively light carbon isotopes in carbonate and organic matter and are tentatively attributed to Karoo-Ferrar magmatism. This negative shift was registered slightly earlier in terrestrial carbon than marine carbonate. Subsequent global warming is credited with liberating isotopically light carbon, and ultimately fostered anoxia in the Paris Basin: the response of these cumulative inputs of carbon to the Earth system. Isotopic and sedimentological evidence indicates continuously elevated phytoplanktonic productivity throughout the first step of the negative CIE, suggesting that the biological pump accelerated the drawdown of excess carbon leading to temporary recovery of carbonate sedimentation, {\~{}}45kyr after the first step of the CIE. This re-establishment of the saturation state of the water column was only fleeting before the later stepwise release of isotopically light carbon. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Sedimentological, palaeontological, and geochemical data of a 152-m thick composite section of the Saiq Formation were used to describe the facies associations and the nature of carbonate precipitation during the Late Permian–Early Triassic at the eastern rim of the Arabian Platform (Sultanate of Oman, Saih Hatat, Wadi Aday). Changhsingian (Late Permian) platform carbonates, dominated by bryozoans, brachiopods and crinoids, are truncated by a mineralized discontinuity surface. The disappearance of Permian calcified metazoans, a negative $\delta$13Ccarb excursion, and a sharp facies contrast collectively suggest that the Permian–Triassic boundary lies in this interval. Unfossiliferous siliciclastics with nodules of iron and manganese minerals on top of the unconformity were probably deposited during a phase when sea water was undersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate. After a gap, late Dienerian carbonate deposition started with abiotically precipitated lime mudstone and biotically induced microbialites having the lowest observed $\delta$13Ccarb values (facies association A). Further up, 1–2 m of bioclastic wacke- and grainstones with a positive $\delta$13Ccarb excursion indicate a short-lived interval of biotically controlled carbonate precipitation (facies association B). The overlying sequence of siliciclastics, laminated or bioturbated dolomitized mudstone, microbialites, dolomitic siltstone, and black calcite, which is characterized by a 2nd negative $\delta$13Ccarb shift, marks the return to biotically induced carbonate precipitation (facies associations C–D). The recrystallized black calcite at the top of the sequence is capped by a thick palaeosol and overlain by late Early to Middle Triassic cycles consisting of biotically precipitated carbonate. The facies development of the rim of the Arabian Platform differs from that of the interior in having a pronounced discontinuity at the Permian–Triassic boundary and an Early Triassic bioclastic carbonate unit sandwiched between abiotically precipitated carbonates. The observed lateral changes in carbonate precipitation across the Arabian Platform could have been caused by changes in oceanic circulation, such as episodic upwelling of deep water.},

This evidence that dissimilatory sulfate reduction can occur in the presence of O2 challenges the conventional view that sulfate reduction is a strictly anaerobic process.  At constant temperature, the rates of sulfate reduction in oxygenated mats during daytime were similar to rates in anoxic mats at night:  thus, during a 24-hour cycle, variations in light and O2 have little effect on rates of sulfate reduction in these mats.},

abstract = {Accurate interpretation of paleoproductivity proxies in the Southern Ocean requires "ground truthing" these proxies. Here the concentrations of total Ba, organic carbon (Corg), and biogenic silica (Sibio), along with other redox-sensitive trace metals (Cd, Re, and Mo), are compared with the distribution of silver (Ag) in core top sediments from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. Conventional thinking holds that enrichment of trace metals should be muted or absent in Southern Ocean sediments despite high export of Corg from surface waters because deposition under well-oxygenated bottom waters inhibits accumulation of reduced metal phases. While our data support this prediction, detectable preserved vertical fluxes of Ag, Cd, and Re exist beneath the opal belt and faithfully record surface productivity patterns. Therefore we suggest Ag fluxes into Southern Ocean sediments occur via biodetritus associated with high export production rather than accumulation by redox-driven diagenetic processes. Sedimentary Ag concentrations are likely altered at the seafloor by biogenic particle remineralization due to high bottom water O2. Nevertheless, zonal Ag fluxes are similar to surface productivity patterns, highlighting the potential of Ag to serve as a proxy for diatom export production. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic life expanded during the Proterozoic eon1, 2.5 to 0.542 billion years ago, against a background of fluctuating ocean chemistry2, 3, 4. After about 1.8 billion years ago, the global ocean is thought to have been characterized by oxygenated surface waters, with anoxic and sulphidic waters in middle depths along productive continental margins and anoxic and iron-containing (ferruginous) deeper waters5, 6, 7. The spatial extent of sulphidic waters probably varied through time5, 6, but this surface-to-deep redox structure is suggested to have persisted until the first Neoproterozoic glaciation about 717 million years ago8, 9, 10, 11. Here we report an analysis of ocean redox conditions throughout the Proterozoic using new and existing iron speciation and sulphur isotope data from multiple cores and outcrops. We find a global transition from sulphidic to ferruginous mid-depth waters in the earliest Neoproterozoic, coincident with the amalgamation of the supercontinent Rodinia at low latitudes. We suggest that ferruginous conditions were initiated by an increase in the oceanic influx of highly reactive iron relative to sulphate, driven by a change in weathering regime and the uptake of sulphate by extensive continental evaporites on Rodinia. We propose that this transition essentially detoxified ocean margin settings, allowing for expanded opportunities for eukaryote diversification following a prolonged evolutionary stasis before one billion years ago.},

The resultril show again the remarkable constancy of the sulphur isotope ratios for meteorites of all types. However, differences in the SBa/Sa* ratios of 0.4 {\%}a would appear to be significant. The Ssz/P4 ratio for meteorites is discussed as a possible base level from which fr{\~{}}tion{\&}tion in the earth's crust began.

A large suite of {\~{}}a water samples collected from widely separated points in three oceans at various depths have also been investigated and the Pa/P4 ratios reported. The results show that the sulphate in the three oceans is exceedingly uniform in isotope ratio, with an enrichment of 20.1 x0 f 0.3 in 584 over that of the meteoritic standard. Sulphur isotope ratios of sulphur in a sea shell, sulphides in shallow ocean sediments, sulphate in rain water and in present-day formation of gypsum evaporites from the sea, have been measured and are compared to the sea water level. The geochemical sulphate cycle is discussed in the light of these results. IT},

abstract = {Late Devonian glaciation is well-documented in three Brazilian basins, and newer work has shown a wider extent for this event, reaching Bolivia, Peru, Central African Republic, Niger, and the USA. Physical evidence for this event includes glacial pavements and polymict striated, and faceted clasts as dropstones and within marine resedimented deposits. Late Devonian (Frasnian? and Famennian) onset of Gondwanaland's glaciations resulted in fundamental changes in coeval and later (Mississippian) depositional systems worldwide. Palynomorphs date the more widespread event within the Retispora lepidophyta (miospore) palynozone, which often occurs with the marine acritarch Umbellasphaeridium saharicum. This initial glaciation continued into earliest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) time. There were several consequences from the short-term glacioeustasy. In North America, central Europe and southern China there is a coeval sea-level fall that exhumed and eroded carbonate platforms, deposited siliciclastics, and generated lacunae in the Famennian record. The lowstand resulted in extensive carbonate breccias, shallow-water deposits and evaporites in western U.S.A. Lowstand clastic wedges were deposited in a regression (eastern U.S.A.) with widespread black shales. In Moravia, Famennian siliciclastic influx increased as a result of subaerial weathering in newly-emergent highs that resulted from sea-level drop. Partial sea-level drops were also manifested by ferruginous oolites, which developed in nearshore environments and were subsequently dispersed down adjacent slopes by storm resedimentation. In southern China, aggradation, siliciclastic influx, reflux-dolomitization from evaporation, and shallow-water carbonate resulted from Famennian sea-level fall. The coupling of glacial and lowstand events explains the sudden appearance of shallow-marine, as well as subaerially-affected features after the Frasnian transgression that breached the North American craton. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Different authors use different methods to assess Permian-Triassic palaeoecological changes, yet no comparative study of different methodologies has been published. We compared two methods of assessing palaeoecological parameters such as diversity, richness and skeletal abundance from limestone thin sections: point-counting and an equal area approach. Results demonstrated that there are significant differences between methodologies. Point-counting is relatively quick but has drawbacks. It is biased with respect to organism size, over-estimates larger taxa/bioclasts, and underestimates smaller taxa/bioclasts. Some point-counting palaeoecological data are not considered useful for measuring biotic recovery because they are affected by taphonomic processes: for example, the presence of diagenetic veins may reduce presumed skeletal abundance; winnowing may increase it. Trends in abundance between locations and regions through time, however, tend to broadly agree between methods, although we recorded Early Triassic samples with much higher skeletal abundances (up to 75{\%}) than in previous published studies. Data from locations in Italy, Oman, and USA were compared. The most diverse samples are Early Induan (Griesbachian) in age from Oman, whilst the Late Induan-Early Olenekian (Dienerian-Smithian) samples from western USA are less diverse. These data agree with previously published inferences of regional variability in recovery rates from field-based macrofossil analyses of tiering and trace fossils. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Temnospondyls are a group of basal tetrapods that existed from the Early Carboniferous to the Early Cretaceous. They were characteristic members of Permian and Triassic continental faunas around the globe. Only one clade, the Brachyopoidea (Brachyopidae and Chigutisauridae), is found as relics in the Jurassic of eastern Asia and the Cretaceous of Australia. The other Late Triassic clades, such as Plagiosauridae, Metoposauridae, and Cyclotsauridae, are generally believed to have gone extinct gradually before the end of the Triassic and putative Rhaetian records are stratigraphically poorly constrained. Temnospondyl humeri all show a similar morphological pattern, being stout, short, with widened ends, and with a typical torsion between the proximal and distal heads. Based on these characters, a humerus found in a Rhaetic-type bonebed in unequivocally Rhaetian sediments (marine Exter Formation) in a clay pit at Bonenburg (eastern Westphalia, Germany) was identified as pertaining to the temnospondyl cf. Cyclotosaurus sp. The humeral midshaft histology also supports temnospondyl affinities and serves to exclude plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs from consideration. This find is the geologically youngest record of a non-brachyopoid temnospondyl, indicating that cyclotosaurids survived well into the Rhaetian, likely falling victim to the end-Triassic extinction.},

The positive correlations of Al2O3 with other elements as well as the abundance of Ba, Ce, Th, Rb, Zn and Zr suggest that these elements are primarily controlled by the dominant clay minerals. Tectonic discrimination diagrams revealed that the sandstones and shales are mostly of quartzose sedimentary provenance, suggesting that they were derived from a cratonic interior or recycled orogen. The binary plots of TiO2 versus Ni, TiO2 against Zr and La/Th versus Hf as well as the ternary diagrams of V-Ni-Th∗10 indicate that the shales and sandstones were derived from felsic igneous rocks. A-CN-K (Al2O3-CaO-K2O) ternary diagram and indices of weathering (CIA, CIW and PIS) suggest that the granitic source rocks underwent moderate to high degree of chemical weathering. The CIA values range between 24.41{\%} and 83.76{\%}, indicating low to high weathering conditions. The CIW values for the studied sandstones and shales range from 25.90 to 96.25{\%}, suggesting moderate to high intensive chemical weathering. ICV values for the sandstones and shales vary from 0.71 to 3.6 (averaging 1.20) and 0.41 to 1.05 (averaging 0.82), respectively. The k2O/Na2O ratios for the studied samples vary from 0.71 to 8.29, which reveal moderate to high maturity. The plot of CIA against ICV shows that most of the shales are geochemically mature and were derived from both weak and intensively weathered source rocks. The tectonic setting discrimination diagrams support passive-Active continental margin setting of the provenance.},

abstract = {There was a significant oxidation of the Earth's surface around 2 billion years ago (2 Gyr)1, 2, 3, 4. Direct evidence for this oxidation comes, mostly, from geological records of the redox-sensitive elements Fe and U reflecting the conditions prevailing during weathering1, 2, 3. The oxidation event was probably driven by an increased input of oxygen to the atmosphere arising from an increased sedimentary burial of organic matter between 2.3 and 2.0 Gyr5. This episode was postdated by the final large precipitation of banded iron formations around 1.8 Gyr1, 2. It is generally believed that banded iron formations precipitated from an ocean whose bottom waters contained significant concentrations of dissolved ferrous iron, and that this sedimentation process terminated when aerobic bottom waters developed, oxidizing the iron and thus removing it from solution1, 2. In contrast, I argue here that anoxic bottom waters probably persisted until well after the deposition of banded iron formations ceased; I also propose that sulphide, rather than oxygen, was responsible for removing iron from deep ocean water. The sulphur-isotope record supports this hypothesis as it indicates increasing concentrations of oceanic sulphate, starting around 2.3 Gyr6, leading to increasing rates of sulphide production by sulphate reduction. The increase in sulphide production became sufficient, around 1.8 Gyr, to precipitate the total flux of iron into the oceans. I suggest that aerobic deep-ocean waters did not develop until the Neoproterozoic era (1.0 to approx0.54 Gyr), in association with a second large oxidation of the Earth's surface. This new model is consistent with the emerging view of Precambrian sulphur geochemistry and the chemical events leading to the evolution of animals, and it is fully testable by detailed geochemical analyses of preserved deep-water marine sediments.},

abstract = {The carbonate carbon isotope record of Lower Triassic shelf sediments was investigated in the Pufels and L´Om Picol (Uomo) sections of the western central Dolomites to derive a complete record from the Permian/Triassic transition to the uppermost Lower Triassic from the western Tethys. The carbon isotope record shows the well-studied decrease at the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB), followed by an increase to about 1.5‰. At the Dienerian/Smithian boundary the $\delta$13C values increase to a pronounced + 6‰ maximum. A steady rapid drop until the upper Smithian below − 2‰ follows this $\delta$13C peak. At the Smithian/Spathian transition, a steep rise to positive values is documented. The positive carbon isotope peak is interpreted to reflect an interval of enhanced burial of organic carbon, whereas the isotopic minima provide evidence of periods of oxidation of organic matter and/or release of isotopically light carbon. This may be ascribed to quickly changing environmental conditions, which have already been postulated by paleontologists due to the delayed biotic recovery from the Permian–Triassic extinction event. Because of the short-time interval these positive isotope excursions represent, their generation by burial of organic carbon in periods of high productivity and/or anoxia appears plausible. Concurrent carbon isotopic excursions are reported from Iran, Pakistan and Oman as well as from Southern China, which indicate an at least Tethys-wide event. If the excursion proves to be of global significance, dark shale deposited in the pelagic Panthalassa Ocean may have acted as sink for organic carbon, supporting the hypothesis of a periodically stratified ocean in the Lower Triassic.},

abstract = {During Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a, 120Ma; Li et al., 2008), organic carbon-rich layers were deposited in marine environments under anoxic conditions on a global scale. In this study, palaeoenvironmental conditions leading to this event are characterised by studying the Upper Barremian to the Lower Aptian succession of the Gorgo a Cerbara section (central Italy). For this, an integrated multi-proxy approach ($\delta$13Ccarb; $\delta$13Corg; $\delta$18O; phosphorus; Total Organic Carbon, TOC; bulk-rock mineralogy, as well as redox-sensitive trace elements - RSTEs) has been applied. During the Late Barremian, thin organic-rich layers occur episodically, and associated Corg:Ptot ratios indicate the presence of intermittent dysoxic to anoxic conditions. Coarse correlations are observed between TOC, P and biogenic silica contents, indicating links between P availability, productivity, and TOC preservation. However, the corresponding $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$18O records remain quite stable, indicating that these brief periods of enhanced TOC preservation did not have sufficient impact on the marine carbon reservoir to deviate $\delta$13C records. Around the Barremian-Aptian boundary, TOC-enriched layers become more frequent. These layers correlate with negative excursions in the $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg records, possibly due to a warming period as indicated by the $\delta$18O record. During the earliest Aptian, this warming trend is reverted into a cooling trend, which is then followed by an important warming step near the onset of Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE 1a). During this time period, organic-rich intervals occur, which are characterised by the progressive increase in RSTE. The warming step prior the onset of OAE 1a is associated with the well-known negative spike in $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg records, an important peak in P accumulation, RSTE enrichments and Corg:Ptot ratios indicating the prevalence of anoxic conditions. The Selli Level itself may document a cooling phase. RSTE enrichments and Corg:Ptot ratios confirm the importance of anoxic conditions during OAE 1a at this site. The Gorgo a Cerbara section is interpreted to reflect the progressive impact of palaeoenvironmental change related to the formation of the Ontong-Java plate-basalt plateau, which started already around the Barremian-Aptian boundary and culminated into OAE 1a. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We document this delayed re-establishment of equatorial forests on the basis of palynological data.

Accordingly, scenarios for both extinctions are increasingly convergent and cross-fertilization of ideas has become important. Here, we present a synthesis of extinction scenarios based on a critical assessment of the available palaeontological, sedimentological, geochemical and geophysical evidence. How similar were the extinction events, what gaps exist in our understanding and how can a comparison of the events enhance our understanding of each event individually? Our focus is on the most important proximate kill mechanisms including: climate change and atmospheric pollution; increased soil erosion, weathering and runoff; forest dieback and the spread of pathogens; and ocean temperature changes, anoxia and acidification. There is substantial evidence to suggest that very similar kill mechanisms acted upon late Permian as well as Late Triassic ecosystems, strengthening the hypothesis that the ultimate causes of the mass-extinction events were similar.},

abstract = {Secondary marine adaptation is a major pattern in amniote evolution, accompanied by specific bone histological adaptations. In the aftermath of the end-Permian extinction, diverse marine reptiles evolved early in the Triassic. Plesiosauria is the most diverse and one of the longest-lived clades of marine reptiles, but its bone histology is least known among the major marine amniote clades. Plesiosaurians had a unique and puzzling body plan, sporting four evenly shaped pointed flippers and (in most clades) a small head on a long, stiffened neck. The flippers were used as hydrofoils in underwater flight. A wide temporal, morphological, and morphometric gap separates plesiosaurians from their closest relatives (basal pistosaurs, Bobosaurus). For nearly two centuries, plesiosaurians were thought to appear suddenly in the earliest Jurassic after the end-Triassic extinctions. Wedescribe the first Triassic plesiosaurian, from the Rhaetian of Germany, and compare its long bone histology to that of later plesiosaurians sampled for this study. The new taxon is recovered as a basalmember of the Pliosauridae, revealing that diversification of plesiosaurians was a Triassic event and that several lineages must have crossed into the Jurassic. Plesiosaurian histology is strikingly uniform and different from stem sauropterygians. Histology suggests the concurrent evolution of fast growth and an elevated metabolic rate as an adaptation to cruising and efficient foraging in the open sea. The newspecimen corroborates the hypothesis that open ocean life of plesiosaurians facilitated their survival of the end-Triassic extinctions.},

abstract = {We present new sulfur and oxygen isotope data in sulfate (??34SSO4 and ??18OSO4 , respectively), from globally distributed marine and estuary pore fluids. We use this data with a model of the biochemical steps involved in bacterial sulfate reduction (BSR) to explore how the slope on a ??18OSO4 vs. ??34SSO4 plot relates to the net sulfate reduction rate (nSRR) across a diverse range of natural environments. Our data demonstrate a correlation between the nSRR and the slope of the relative evolution of oxygen and sulfur isotopes (??18OSO4 vs. ??34SSO4) in the residual sulfate pool, such that higher nSRR results in a lower slope (sulfur isotopes increase faster relative to oxygen isotopes). We combine these results with previously published literature data to show that this correlation scales over many orders of magnitude of nSRR. Our model of the mechanism of BSR indicates that the critical parameter for the relative evolution of oxygen and sulfur isotopes in sulfate during BSR in natural environments is the rate of intracellular sulfite oxidation. In environments where sulfate reduction is fast, such as estuaries and marginal marine environments, this sulfite reoxidation is minimal, and the ??18OSO4 increases more slowly relative to the ??34SSO4. In contrast, in environments where sulfate reduction is very slow, such as deep sea sediments, our model suggests sulfite reoxidation is far more extensive, with as much as 99{\%} of the sulfate being thus recycled; in these environments the ??18OSO4 increases much more rapidly relative to the ??34SSO4. We speculate that the recycling of sulfite plays a physiological role during BSR, helping maintain microbial activity where the availability of the electron donor (e.g. available organic matter) is low. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A detailed facies study of Early Permian strata within NE Svalbard reveals a fundamental change of the depositional setting, from a restricted-marine, warm-water carbonate platform to an open-marine, temperate-water, mixed siliciclastic-carbonate ramp. The uppermost strata of the Gipshuken Formation (Templet and Sorfonna members; Sakmarian-early Artinskian?) consist of microbialites (algal mats), mudstones, bioclastic/peloidal limestones, carbonate breccias and Microcodium facies reflecting peritidal platform areas and supratidal sabkhas. A mixed heterozoan/reduced photozoan assemblage indicates temperate-water conditions within neighboring deeper, open-marine mid-platform areas, while warm-water conditions still prevailed within inner platform zones. In contrast, the lowermost strata of the overlying Kapp Starostin Formation (Voringen Member; late Artinskian?-Kungurian) show a fully heterozoan biotic assemblage reflecting temperate water conditions within open-marine, storm-dominated, nearshore to transitional offshore areas of a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic ramp. The Voringen Member comprises three facies associations, which form a shallowing-upward sequence subsequent to an initial transgression. The sediments reflect bryozoan bioherms in most distal areas, followed by stacked tempestites of sandy brachiopodal shell banks and Skolithos piperocks, grading into broad sand flats in most proximal areas of the inner ramp. The above environmental change is regarded as a regional event taken place across the entire shelf along the northern margin of Pangea and is attributed to paleoclimatic, paleoceanographic, as well as paleogeographic changes, possibly related to the overall northwards drift of the supercontinent. An abrupt increase in terrigenous input coinciding with this change is ascribed to the uplift of a new local source area, probably to the north or east of the investigation area.},

abstract = {Constraining the carbon isotopic changes associated with the end-Triassic mass extinction is key to understanding the causes of the extinction and dynamics of recovery from it. Yet the pattern and timing of {\&}{\#}948;13C variation surrounding the extinction remain poorly constrained. Here we present close to 1000 new {\&}{\#}948;13C measurements from six newly sampled sections in Italy. We observe a sharp negative excursion in {\&}{\#}948;13Ccarb coincident with the disappearance of the Triassic fauna, and two positive excursions above it. The negative {\&}{\#}948;13Ccarb excursion in these sections does not occur in {\&}{\#}948;13Corg suggesting a possible diagenetic origin. In contrast, the interval of elevated {\&}{\#}948;13C occurs in both carbonate and organic carbon, suggesting that it is likely to be a primary feature. The positive excursions in the Lombardy Basin (southern Alps) and Mt. Cefalo (southern Apennines) appear to be time correlative on the basis of their position above the disappearance of characteristically Triassic biota. However, it is less certain that they are time correlative with positive excursions in other sections worldwide, as few options exist that honor both bio- and chemostratigraphy. Nonetheless, similarity to other events that are interpreted as global, as well as carbon cycle considerations, suggest that the isotopic enrichment is best interpreted to reflect a shift in the isotope composition of the global surface carbon reservoir. Our data indicate that perturbation of the global carbon cycle was not confined to the immediate vicinity of the extinction interval, but rather persisted for substantial length of geologic time afterwards.},

abstract = {New records of the abundance of C-13 in marine organic matter have been compiled for (i) the later Neoproterozoic, from 800 to 543 Ma (346 analyses), (ii) the Cambrian through the Jurassic (1616 analyses), and (iii) the Cretaceous and Cenozoic (2493 analyses). Comparison of these to existing compilations of the abundance of C-13 in sedimentary carbonates has allowed development of a record of the isotopic fractionation (= epsilon(TOC)) accompanying the production and burial of organic material. Over time, globally averaged values of epsilon(TOC) have fallen in three ranges: (i) greater than 32 parts per thousand and apparently indicative of significant inputs from sulfide-oxidizing or other chemoautotrophic bacteria, notably during late Proterozoic interglacials at 752, 740-732, and 623-600 Ma; (ii) between 28 and 32 parts per thousand and indicative of maximal fractionation of carbon isotopes by phytoplanktonic producers, during the Neoproterozoic from 800 to 750 and from 685 to 625 Ma and during the Phanerozoic up to the early Oligocene; and (iii) less than 28 parts per thousand, probably reflecting a reduction of primary fractionation by some combination of low levels of CO2, rapid rates of growth, and high ratios of cellular volume to surface area during Neoproterozoic glaciations (740, 720, and 575 Ma) and since the early Oligocene. Evidence of similar variations during the Ordovician and Gondwanan glaciations is absent. The decline in epsilon(TOC) since the early Oligocene, from 30 to 22 parts per thousand, has been nearly linear. The structure of the record of epsilon(TOC) suggests that the maximal isotopic fractionation between dissolved CO2 and primary biomass has consistently been 25 parts per thousand. Overall, the records provide compelling evidence that values of epsilon(TOC) have varied widely and that the long-term average fractionation is roughly 30 parts per thousand.

abstract = {Dedicated to the memory of William T. Holser, colleague and friend.A gap in the fossil record of coals and coral reefs during the Early Triassic follows the greatest of mass extinctions at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Catastrophic methane outbursts during terminal Permian global mass extinction are indicated by organic carbon isotopic ($\delta$13Corg) values of less than –37‰, and preferential sequestration of 13C-depleted carbon at high latitudes and on land, relative to low latitudes and deep ocean. Methane outbursts massive enough to account for observed carbon isotopic anomalies require unusually efficient release from thermal alteration of coal measures or from methane-bearing permafrost or marine methane-hydrate reservoirs due to bolide impact, volcanic eruption, submarine landslides, or global warming. The terminal Permian carbon isotopic anomaly has been regarded as a consequence of mass extinction, but atmospheric injections of methane and its oxidation to carbon dioxide could have been a cause of extinction for animals, plants, coral reefs and peat swamps, killing by hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, and pulmonary edema. Extinction by hydrocarbon pollution of the atmosphere is compatible with many details of the marine and terrestrial fossil records, and with observed marine and nonmarine facies changes. Multiple methane releases explain not only erratic early Triassic carbon isotopic values, but also protracted (∼6 m.y.) global suppression of coral reefs and peat swamps. },

abstract = {The pyritization of reactive trace elements in different anoxic marine sediments was investigated to determine the importance of factors such as [summation operator]H2S, reactive-Fe, pyrite content and salinity in controlling this process. The areas studied included anoxic-sulfidic sediments (Baffin Bay, a hypersaline coastal lagoon from Texas and Green Canyon, a hemipelagic oil seepage area), anoxic-nonsulfidic sediments with high sedimentation rates (Atchafalaya Bay-Mississippi Delta system), hemipelagic anoxic-nonsulfidic sediments with low sedimentation rates (Gulf of Mexico shelf and slope and Orca Basin, an euxinic hypersaline basin) and organic-rich marsh sediments (Atchafalaya Bay). Results indicate that the degree of trace metal pyritization (DTMP) of all trace metals, except Cd, increased with increasing degree of pyritization (DOP), irrespective of the type of sedimentary environment involved. However, for As, Hg and Mo, the values were generally above the 1:1 ratio line, whereas the transition metals Co, Cu, Mn and Ni displayed a close to linear increase in DTMP with DOP and moderate incorporation into pyrite. Chromium and the class B metals Pb and Zn were also gradually incorporated into the pyrite phase but without reaching the DTMP levels exhibited by the transition metals. Cadmium was not incorporated to a significant extent. These results are consistent with the chemical attributes of these different classes of trace elements. Availability of dissolved trace metals and organic matter content are apparently important factors controlling the incorporation of Co, Cr, Cu and Ni into pyrite in anoxicsulfidic (Fe-poor and H2S-rich) environments.},

abstract = {Detailed microfacies and paleoenvironmental analyses were conducted through the Early Triassic interval of the outer platform ammonoid-rich series of the Nanpanjiang Basin (Luolou Formation, Guangxi Province, South China). Extensive investigations on outcrops and on thin sections reveal that the widely reported well-diversified latest Permian fauna, dominated by abundant corals, calcareous algae, calcareous sponges, crinoids, brachiopods, gastropods, ostracods and foraminifera, is abruptly replaced by decimated Early Triassic communities essentially composed of low-diversity bivalves, microgastropods, ostracods, and rare foraminifera. Along with this drastic change in faunal assemblages, the recolonization of devastated habitats by calcimicrobial frameworks is observed in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. Calcimicrobialites of Griesbachian age are followed by mixed, ammonoid- and conodont-rich carbonate-siliciclastic series consisting of dark, suboxic, laminated mudstones intercalated with organic-rich shales of Dienerian to late Smithian age. The carbonate-siliciclastic series are interrupted by a brief carbonate episode during the early-middle Smithian. Massive carbonate production resumes only from the early Spathian onward and persists throughout the Spathian. The initial deposition of both carbonate episodes is coeval with (i) re-establishment of well-oxygenated conditions, (ii) a marked (early Smithian) to extreme (early Spathian) ammonoid/conodont diversification, (iii) a significant increase in the skeletal grain diversity and abundance and, (iv) peak carbon isotope values. A short interval of black, organic-rich shales precedes the onset of these two distinct carbonate events, which are both marked by a positive carbonate carbon isotope excursion known from other Tethyan marine localities. The comparison between the Early Triassic stratigraphic evolution of Tethyan outer platform paleoenvironments and platform/basin margin settings of the Nanpanjiang Basin suggests a causal connection between large fluctuations of the global carbon cycle, climate shifts, sea-level changes, oxygen availability in the oceans and the biological rediversification in the wake of the end-Permian biotic crisis. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The Latest Permian transgression in the Sverdrup Basin of Arctic Canada initiated prior to onset of deep-water anoxia and continued past the Latest Permian Extinction event. Deep-water anoxia initiated after the shelf was flooded in mid to Late Changhsingian time, requiring a much more rapid, and much greater vertical, rise in the chemocline than that associated with relative sea level, supporting the chemocline upward excursion model. Our work also extends evidence of global euxinc conditions to NW Pangea. Euxinic conditions developed just prior to the main extinction event, and we suggest that this was associated with a significant pyrite rain-out event which stripped bio-essential nutrients from anoxic seawater prior to the main disruption of the global carbon cycle, as recorded by shifts in the carbon isotope record.

abstract = {ABSTRACT There is much debate regarding the intensity and geographic extent of glaciation during the Neoproterozoic, particularly in response to recent geochemical work suggesting that the Neoproterozoic earth was at times ice covered from equator to poles (the 'Snowball Earth' hypothesis). A detailed sedimentological analysis of the Neoproterozoic Smalfjord Formation of northern Norway was conducted in order to determine the extent and intensity of glacial influence on sedimentation. In the Tarmfjorden area, the Smalfjord Formation consists of a stacked succession of diamictites interbedded with fine-grained laminated mudstones containing rare outsized clasts. Diamictites and interbedded mudstones are interpreted as the product of subaqueous mass flows generated along the basin margin. In the Varangerfjorden area, chaotically interbedded diamictites, conglomerates and sandstones are overlain by a thick succession of stacked sandstone beds; onediamictite unit at Bigganjargga overlies a striated pavement. The Varangerfjorden outcrops appear to record deposition on a subaqueous debris apron. Although diamictites contain rare striated and faceted clasts, suggesting a glacial sediment source, their origin as subaqueous mass flows prevents the interpretation of ice mass form or distribution. Rare lonestones may be associated with floating ice in the basin, which may be of glacial or seasonal origin. Glacial ice may have contributed poorly sorted glacial debris to the basin margin, either directly or through fluvioglacial systems, but there is no evidence of direct deposition by ice at Varangerfjorden or Tarmfjorden. The overall fining-upward trend identified in the Smalfjord Formation and overlying Nyborg Formation is consistent with depositional models of rift basin settings. This fining-upward trend, the predominance of mass flow facies including breccias associated with scarps and the evidence for extensional tectonic activity in the region suggest that tectonic activity may have played an important role in the development of this Neoproterozoic succession. The Smalfjord Formation at Tarmfjorden and Varangerfjorden does not exhibit sedimentological characteristics consistent with severe glacial conditions suggested by the snowball Earth hypothesis.},

Moreover, geochemical modelling indicates that p O 2 has fluctuated substantially over the course of the Phanerozoic: up to c . 35{\%} in the late Palaeozoic, and down to perhaps 10{\%} in the early Mesozoic (Falkowski et al 2005; Berner, 2006). Such shifts have been considered instrumental in directing the course of Phanerozoic evolution and extinction (Falkowski et al 2005; Huey {\&} Ward, 2005; Ward et al 2006; Berner et al 2007), including the EdiacaranCambrian radiations of macroscopic life (Berkner {\&} Marshall, 1965; Anbar {\&} Knoll, 2002; Catling et al 2005; Holland, 2006; Canfield et al 2007). This is certainly a worthy hypothesis, and one that has gained an exceptionally wide following over the past decade but a popular paradigm still needs to be tested and weighed against competing scenarios. In this editorial, I take critical look at the oxygen-evolution connection and discuss an alternative, biological explanation for geochemical signatures through the terminal Proterozoic. In the absence of direct measurements, the oxygen content of ancient atmospheres is inferred from a combination of geochemical proxies and modelling. These values, however, are accompanied by substantial error (see Berner et al 2007: fig. 1; Kump, 2008: fig. 2), and differing modelling assumptions yield conspicuously different results. For example, where Bergman et al . (2004) estimate the oxygen content of Mesozoic atmospheres to be continuously at or above PAL, Berner (2006) puts late Triassic/early Jurassic levels close to 50{\%} PAL, followed by an early Cretaceous rise to more or less modern levels. Falkowski et al . (2005) also recognize an early Jurassic minimum, but with PAL not reached until the Eocene. All models are of course limited by the runaway wildfire induced at p O 2 {\textgreater} 35{\%}, and lack of fire at p O 2 0.2{\%} (1{\%} PAL), and the rise of conspicuously macroscopic fossils from c . 575 Ma sets a Phanerozoic lower limit of c . 1{\%} p O 2 or 5{\%} PAL (Canfield, 2005; Catling et al 2005; Holland, 2006; Kump, 2008). Deep-sea geochemical proxies and modelling have been used to estimate an upper limit of c . 8{\%} p O 2 (40{\%} PAL) for most of the Proterozoic.},

abstract = {Systematic changes in the chemistry of evaporated seawater contained in primary fluid inclusions in marine halites indicate that seawater chemistry has fluctuated during the Phanerozoic. The fluctuations are in phase with oscillations in seafloor spreading rates, volcanism, global sea level, and the primary mineralogies of marine limestones and evaporites. The data suggest that seawater had high Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios ({\textgreater}2.5) and relatively high Na+ concentrations during the Late Precambrian [544 to 543 million years ago (Ma)], Permian (258 to 251 Ma), and Tertiary through the present (40 to 0 Ma), when aragonite and MgSO4 salts were the dominant marine precipitates. Conversely, seawater had low Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios ({\textless}2.3) and relatively low Na+ concentrations during the Cambrian (540 to 520 Ma), Silurian (440 to 418 Ma), and Cretaceous (124 to 94 Ma), when calcite was the dominant nonskeletal carbonate and K-, Mg-, and Ca-bearing chloride salts, were the only potash evaporites.},

abstract = {The Precambrian-Cambrian boundary is claimed as one of the most crucial biological breakthroughs on our planet, when changes in chemical and physical conditions, together with key biological innovations, helped to trigger a biodiversity " explosion" The Yangtze Platform (South China), mainly characterized by continuous and unaltered successions of this age, is ideally suited to high-resolution, palaeomarine investigations of this event. In this study, $\delta$15N and $\delta$13Corg records from Xiaotan Section (Yunnan, SW China) were investigated in order to provide insight into variations in primary productivity, ecological developments and marine environment. The Ediacaran-early Cambrian Xiaotan section is characterized by relatively high sedimentation rates and variable lithologies (carbonates, cherts, phosphorites, sandstones and siltstones) that alternate through nearly 600 meters thickness. Organic carbon isotope values vary between -36‰ and -21‰, tightly following and helping to complete published $\delta$13Ccarb trends. The base of the Cambrian is characterized in this section by a significant drop from -25‰ to -35‰, mirroring the $\delta$13Ccarb fall observed at this and other sections worldwide. Higher in the section in the Dahai Member, values increase to -20‰, again demonstrating communication between DOC and DIC pools during the early Cambrian on 105-106year time scales. From the base of the overlying Shiyantou Formation, $\delta$13Corg values remain around -30‰ until the end of the section, testifying to an interval of more modest change in DIC $\delta$13C that would be consistent with biostratigraphic correlations. Nitrogen isotope values vary independently from carbon isotope trends, exhibiting several major $\delta$15N cycles, with values fluctuating between +9‰ and -1‰. Robust trends in $\delta$15N within the Dahai Member testify to changes in the ratio between nitrogen fixation and denitrification, possibly reflecting fluctuations in the water column chemocline as $\delta$13C values reached their global acme. Up section, nitrogen isotope values show dampened cyclicity with values remaining between 0‰ and +5‰, indicating establishment of an equilibrium state in marine biogeochemistry and nutrient cycles. The overall variability in $\delta$15N closely resembles that of recent marine sediments, while the observed cyclicity is defined by several samples in all cases. These observations argue for good preservation of original isotopic signatures which bodes well for future N isotope studies of the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

Although the precise mechanisms that led to this mass extinction remain enigmatic, most postulated scenarios involve a short-lived global cooling, a so-called "impact winter" phase. Here we document a major decline in sea surface temperature during the first months to decades following the impact event, using TEX86 paleothermometry of sediments from the Brazos River section, Texas. We interpret this cold spell to reflect, to our knowledge, the first direct evidence for the effects of the formation of dust and aerosols by the impact and their injection in the stratosphere, blocking incoming solar radiation. This impact winter was likely a major driver of mass extinction because of the resulting global decimation of marine and continental photosynthesis.},

@article{Altabet1999,
abstract = {The nitrogen isotopic composition of time-series sediment trap samples, dissolved NO3/-, and surficial sediments was determined in three regions along the margin of the eastern North Pacific: Monterey Bay, San Pedro Basin, and the Gulf of California (Carmen and Guaymas Basins). Complex physical regimes are present in all three areas, and each is influenced seasonally by coastal upwelling. Nevertheless, sediment trap material evidently records the isotopic composition of new nitrogen sources, since average $\delta$15N is generally indistinguishable from $\delta$15N values for subsurface NO3/-. Surficial sediments are also very similar to the average $\delta$15N value of the sediment traps, being within 1‰. This difference in $\delta$15N between trap material and sediment is much less than the previously observed 4‰ difference for the deep sea. Better organic matter preservation at our margin sites is a likely explanation, which may be due to either low bottom O2 concentrations or higher organic matter input to the sediments. All sites have $\delta$15N for sub-euphotic zone NO3/- (8-10‰) substantially elevated from the oceanic average (4.5-5‰). This isotopic enrichment is a result of denitrification in suboxic subsurface waters (Gulf of California) or northward transport of denitrification influenced water (Monterey Bay and San Pedro Basin). Our results therefore suggest that downcore $\delta$15N data, depending on site location, would record the intensity of denitrification and the transport of its isotopic signature along the California margin. Temporal variations in $\delta$15N for the sediment traps do appear to respond to upwelling or convective injections of NO3/- to surface waters as a result of isotopic fractionation during phytoplankton uptake. Overall, though, the coupling between NO3/- injection, $\delta$15N, and flux is looser than previously observed for the open-ocean, most likely the result of the smaller time/space scales of the events. In the Gulf of California, wintertime convective mixing/upwelling does produce distinct $\delta$15N minima co-occurring with particle flux maxima. Interannual variations are apparent in this region when these wintertime $\delta$15N minima fail to occur during El Nino conditions. There appears to be a positive relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly and annual average $\delta$15N. One explanation calls for hydrographic changes altering the $\delta$15N of subeuphotic zone NO3/-.},

abstract = {The Tonian–Cambrian interval (c. 0.9– 0.5 Ga) witnessed major tectonic, climatic and chemical changes to the Earth system and culminated in the Ediacaran– Cambrian radiation of ani-mals. Negative carbon isotope (d 13 C) excursions of extraordinary magnitude form the backdrop to all these events and are consistent with the presence of a vast marine organic carbon reservoir that changed its size due to periodic imbalances between organic production (as an oxidant source) and terrestrial oxidant sinks. Prior to both Cryogenian glaciations, this pool of long-lived organic car-bon may have become substantially depleted, leading to a weakening of the regulation of climate and oxygen. The late Ediacaran Shuram anomaly probably represents a third depletion event, which was followed by oxygenation and the Ediacaran–Cambrian radiation. The evolutionary diversification of animals shortened the ocean residence time of organic carbon and introduced new carbon cycle feedbacks that together helped to mould the modern Earth system.},

abstract = {Between summer of 1996 and 1997, a continuous set of samples was collected in a sediment trap at 140-m water depth at a station in the central Gotland Sea. Fluxes of total sedimented matter, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen, biogenic silica and particulate phosphorus as well as the isotopic composition of organic carbon and nitrogen were estimated. The total vertical particles flux was found to be 35 g m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 year{\^{a}}ˆ'1 and fluxes of organic carbon, total nitrogen and phosphorus and biogenic silica amounted to 6.0, 0.8, 0.19 and 6.2 g m{\^{a}}ˆ'2 year{\^{a}}ˆ'1, respectively. Highest rates of vertical particle-transport for all compounds occurred in September 1996 and lowest fluxes during October{\^{a}}€“February. Based on the isotopic signature in the particulate nitrogen, fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by pelagic cyanobacteria could be identified as the major source for export production during the summer season. The isotopic composition of the spring sedimentation pulse indicates uptake of a mixture of laterally introduced and locally produced nitrate accumulated in the winter mixed layer during the non-growth season. The contribution of nitrogen fixation to the sedimentary nitrogen inventory in the central Gotland Sea is estimated to be in the range of 45{\%}. This is consistent with nitrogen isotope data of surface sediments and budged calculations. Annual accumulation rates of organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in the underlying sediments (at 241-m water depth) are two- to sevenfold higher than the measured vertical particle flux indicating laterally advected material as the main source for sediment formation in this depositional area. The stable isotope composition of organic carbon and nitrogen of surface sediments was comparable to a weighted annual mean from the sediment trap samples, implying the source of bulk sedimentary organic matter originates from the pelagial of the central Baltic Sea.},

abstract = {Abstract:{\$}\backslash{\$}nA high-resolution palynological study of the Triassic–Jurassic boundary in the St. Audrie's Bay section revealed a palynofloral transition interval with four pronounced spore peaks in the Lilstock Formation. Regular cyclic increases in palynomorph concentrations can be linked with periods of increased runoff, and correspond to the orbital eccentricity cycle. Spore peaks can be related to precession-induced variations in monsoon strength. An implication is that the initial carbon isotope excursion lasted for at least 20 ka. Emergence during deposition of the Cotham Member had an influence on one of the peaks, which is dominated by spore-producing pioneer plants (e.g. horsetails and liverworts). There is no compelling evidence of a global end-Triassic spore spike that, by analogy with the K–T boundary fern spike, could be related to a catastrophic mass extinction event. Climate change is a more plausible mechanism to explain the increased amount of spores.{\$}\backslash{\$}nSupplementary material: An alphabetical list of palynomorphs identified in the St. Audrie's Bay section is available at http://www.geolsoc.org.uk/SUP18406.},

abstract = {Ecological and evolutionary principles are often context-dependent, particularly where the context is biologically defined. Organ-grade animals (eumetazoans) are particularly powerful contextual agents, with a unique capacity to drive escalatory co-evolution and build multi-tiered food-webs. The evolution of eumetazoans through the Ediacaran and early Cambrian fundamentally altered macroecological and macroevolutionary dynamics, including the structure and function of the marine carbon cycle. Pelagic eumetazoans can be held responsible for driving the evolution of relatively large eukaryotic phytoplankton, thereby shifting the system from a turbid, stratified, cyanobacteria-dominated stable state to the clear-water, well-oxygenated, algae-dominated condition typical of the Phanerozoic. Intermittent return to the pre-Ediacaran state during Phanerozoic extinctions and oceanic anoxic events suggests that the widespread anoxia detected in pre-Ediacaran deep-marine sequences may be a consequence of this alternate biological pump rather than a reflection of fundamentally lower levels of atmospheric oxygen. The transition between the pre- and post-Ediacaran states is also associated with the oldest commercially exploitable hydrocarbons, a possible by-product of invading animals and their top-down impact on the biological pump.},

abstract = {The isotope record of organic matter and calcium carbonate is often used to infer the burial history of organic carbon through time. As organic carbon burial is widely held to control long-term oxygen production, the isotope record also relates to the production rates of oxygen on Earth. Current interpretations of the record suggest a long-term consistency in the proportion of total carbon buried as organic carbon ( f ratio), with some important periods of much higher burial proportions. The isotope record is analyzed here with a new carbon isotope mass balance model, which considers submarine hydrothermal weathering of ocean crust as a significant removal pathway of inorganic carbon. With this model the f ratio is considerably reduced if isotopically depleted inorganic carbon is precipitated during hydrothermal weathering and if hydrothermal weathering dominates inorganic carbon removal from the surface environment. In contrast to previous calculations, our analysis of the carbon isotope record shows that organic carbon burial in the Archean accounted for only between 0{\%} and 10{\%} of the total carbon burial. These low burial proportions would have contributed to a slow accumulation of atmospheric oxygen in the Archean.},

abstract = {The controversial Capitanian (Middle Permian, 262 Ma) extinction event is only known from equatorial latitudes, and consequently its global extent is poorly resolved. We demonstrate that there were two, severe extinctions amongst brachiopods in northern Boreal latitudes (Spitsbergen) in the Middle to Late Permian, separated by a recovery phase. New age dating of the Spitsbergen strata (belonging to the Kapp Starostin Formation), using strontium isotopes and $\delta$13C trends and comparison with better-dated sections in Greenland, suggests that the first crisis occurred in the Capitanian. This age assignment indicates that this Middle Permian extinction is manifested at higher latitudes. Redox proxies (pyrite framboids and trace metals) show that the Boreal crisis coincided with an intensification of oxygen depletion, implicating anoxia in the extinction scenario. The widespread and near-total loss of carbonates across the Boreal Realm also suggests a role for acidification in the crisis. The recovery interval saw the appearance of new brachiopod and bivalve taxa alongside survivors, and an increased mollusk dominance, resulting in an assemblage reminiscent of younger Mesozoic assemblages. The subsequent end-Permian mass extinction terminated this Late Permian radiation.},

abstract = {Fluxes of dissolved nutrients in the organic-rich sediment of Makirina Bay (Croatia) were estimated in in-situ incubation experiments and compared to those calculated from a diagenetic model based on the concentration vs. depth profiles in the pore water extracted from a sediment core at the same sampling site. Benthic fluxes observed in the in-situ experiment were strongly influenced by the decomposition of sedimentary organic matter by bacterial sulfate reduction and precipitation of authigenic pyrite and calcite. Assimilation of dissolved nitrate and ammonia within the sediment resulted in peculiar nitrate and ammonia concentration profiles. Differences between the benthic and diffusive fluxes indicated that the effects of bioturbation and irrigation, which were not taken into account in the model calculation of diffusive fluxes, should not be considered as negligible. They are, however, extremely difficult to estimate because of the heterogeneity of the sediment. Sulfate reduction in the pore water could not be detected, although it was obvious from pyrite precipitation and the isotopic compositions of different sedimentary sulfur species. It is suggested that reoxidation of sulfide and upward diffusion of sulfate from the sediment layer accumulated during past salt production can account for the scattered sulfate vs. depth profile. The distribution and stable isotope compositions of sedimentary sulfur species were studied in more detail. The influx of sulfate was explained by rapid sulfate reduction in the sediment. The sulfate reduction rate was highest in the upper part of the sediment column, as concluded from $\delta$34S values. In lower horizons, the concentration of organic sulfur increased, while concentrations of sulfide decreased. The mirror-imaged concentration vs. depth profiles of sulfide and organic sulfur, as well as their stable isotopic compositions, show that they were formed simultaneously, most probably in competitive processes. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

(2) The ??13C-values vary periodically from the base to the top in a stratigraphic unit. 3. (3) The ??13C-values are positive below, but negative above the Permian-Triassic boundary. The ??13C-values display a sharp drop within a limited stratigraphic interval (0.1 - 0.5 m) across the Permian-Triassic boundary. Our study and carbon isotope investigations of marine carbonate sequences across the Permian-Triassic boundary in other areas suggest that a drastic shift in carbon isotope compositions at the Permian-Triassic boundary probably occurred contemporaneously and globally, at least in the Tethys areas. The variation of carbon isotope compositions in marine stratigraphy sections may be used as a new criterion for stratigraphic correlation. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {The distributions of C31–C35 17$\alpha$,21$\beta$(H)-homohopanes in marine petroleums can be used to describe redox conditions in the source rock depositional environment. For example, high C35-homohopane indices [C35/(C31–C35)] are typical of petroleums generated from source rocks deposited under anoxic marine conditions, where the C35 backbone of the precursor bacteriohopanetetrol is preferentially preserved. Homohopane distributions have been used to distinguish petroleums from different organic facies of the same source rock. Homohopane distributions are altered by secondary processes. For example, the C35-homohopane index decreases with increasing API gravity and thermal maturity of related oils from the Monterey Formation, offshore California. Similar decreases in the homohopane index are observed for expelled oils from Monterey source rock during hydrous pyrolysis. Biodegradation can result in selective loss of high or low molecular weight homologs, apparently depending on the bacterial population in the reservoir. Bacterial demethylation of homohopanes appears necessary to explain 25-norhopanes in at least one biodegraded oil.  Hydrous pyrolysis studies of the Phosphatic and Siliceous members in the Monterey Formation show that identical heating conditions result in different homohopane C-22 epimer ratios. Furthermore, a “reversal” in the trend of the epimer ratio at high experimental temperatures is observed for the Phosphatic, but not for the Siliceous lithology. This could be caused by the combined effects of isomerization and differential thermal destruction of epimers at high temperatures, possibly mediated by rock mineralogy.},

These fluctuations result from expansions and contractions of continental ice sheets that occur in phase with the Milankovitch periodicities of the Earth's orbit1,2.  Smaller-amplitude sea-level fluctuations associated with Milankovitch periodicities are also evident during warm periods, such as the Late Triassic3-5, which lack strong evidence for continental glaciation6. We argue here that, in times of limited ice volume, periodic climate-induced changes in lake and groundwater storage have the potential to produce small fluctuations in sea level. This mechanism could contribute a small component of the sea-level change observed in the Quaternary period, and may dominate the Milankovitch eustatic sea-level signal during earlier periods with limited ice volume6. We present evidence of contemporaneous Milankovitch periodicities in Late Triassic lake sediments7 and sea-level fluctuation3-5 which support the causal link between lake water storage and eustasy.},

abstract = {A significant body of evidence suggests that the marine environment remained largely anoxic throughout most of the Precambrian. In contrast, the oxygenation history of terrestrial aquatic environments has received little attention, despite the significance of such settings for early eukaryote evolution. To address this, we provide here a geochemical and isotopic assessment of sediments from the late Mesoproterozoic Nonesuch Formation of central North America. We utilize rhenium-osmium (Re-Os) geochronology to yield a depositional age of 1078 ± 24 Ma, while Os isotope compositions support existing evidence for a lacustrine setting. Fe-S-C systematics suggest that the Nonesuch Formation was deposited from an anoxic Fe-rich (ferruginous) water column. Thus, similar to the marine realm, anoxia persisted in terrestrial aquatic environments in the Middle to Late Proterozoic, but sulfidic water column conditions were not ubiquitous. Our data suggest that oxygenation of the terrestrial realm was not pervasive at this time and may not have preceded oxygenation of the marine environment, signifying a major requirement for further investigation of links between the oxygenation state of terrestrial aquatic environments and eukaryote evolution.},

@article{Lehrmann2003,
abstract = {Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) sections from isolated carbonate platforms in the Nanpanjiang Basin of south China contain Upper Permian skeletal packstones with diverse open-marine fossils overlain by a 7-15 m thick boundary horizon composed of calcimicrobial framestone constructed by globular to tufted, calcified cyanobacteria similar to Renalcis. The framestone contains interbeds of lime-grainstone with abundant thin-shelled bivalves and brachiopods. The overlying Lower Triassic strata contain microgastropod lime-packstones followed by a thick succession of thin-bedded lime-mudstones. The PTB event horizon is interpreted to occur at the top of the packstone containing diverse, open-marine fauna and Palaeofusulina and coincident with the abrupt change to calcimicrobial framestone lacking Permian macrofossils. The conformable biostratigraphic boundary occurs at the first appearance of Hindeodus parvus within the basal meter of the calcimicrobial framestone. Intensively studied PTB sections in south China, such as the GSSP at Meishan, primarily are condensed sections from deep-water, basin environments that contain a thin ({\textless} 30 cm) boundary horizon of claystone and lime-mudstone or marl. The sections reported herein are fundamentally different in that they consist of shallow-marine carbonate facies, contain a thick boundary horizon composed of calcimicrobial framestone, and lack evidence of an abrupt shift in depositional environment or water depth. The calcimicrobial framestone boundary horizon occurs in all of the isolated carbonate platforms in the Nanpanjiang Basin. A similar microbial facies has been found in the basal Triassic H. parvus zone in the Sichuan Basin and in Japan. Distribution of the calcimicrobial framestone suggests that it may represent an anomalous oceanic event that affected a vast area of the equatorial eastern Tethys and Panthalassa during and/or immediately following the end-Permian mass extinction. The persistence of similar calcimicrobial framestone horizons into the Upper Scythian suggests that detrimental environmental conditions associated with the extinction persisted until the end of the Scythian. Further study of these sections promises to provide constraints on causes of the extinction and the environments in the aftermath.},

Periodic oscillations in the relative yields are similar to those reported for atomic ions at lower impact energies on electron multipliers. A correlation between monoxide ion yields and atomic ion yields has been shown; the monoxide ion of an element has an electron yield which exceeds that of the corresponding atomic ion yield by a constant factor. A similar correlation has been shown for the dimer ions, with a different offset. The effect of using uncorrected signals in some quantitative analysis methods using SIMS is illustrated, showing that as much as 100{\%} error may arise from this source alone. The use of uncorrected monoxide ion signals in these schemes is similarly shown to induce errors caused by the higher monoxide ion yields compared to atomic ions. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

abstract = {The mid-Cretaceous is widely considered the archetypal ice-free greenhouse interval in Earth history, with a thermal maximum around Cenomanian-Turonian boundary time (ca. 90 Ma). However, contemporaneous glaciations have been hypothesized based on sequence stratigraphic evidence for rapid sea-level oscillation and oxygen isotope excursions in records generated from carbonates of questionable preservation and/or of low resolution. We present new oxygen isotope records for the mid-Cenomanian Demerara Rise that are of much higher resolution than previously available, taken from both planktic and benthic foraminifers, and utilizing only extremely well preserved glassy foraminifers. Our records show no evidence of glaciation, calling into question the hypothesized ice sheets and rendering the origin of inferred rapid sea-level oscillations enigmatic. Simple mass-balance calculations demonstrate that this Cretaceous sea-level paradox is unlikely to be explained by hidden ice sheets existing below the limit of $\delta$18O detection.},

@article{Heydari2003a,
abstract = {The smoking gun revealing the secrets of the end-Permian mass mortality is a unique 1-2-m-thick layer consisting of 5-20-cm-long crystals of calcite that occurs precisely at the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) in Iran, Armenia, Turkey, and China. This layer is interpreted as synsedimentary, abiotic, seafloor cement indicative of precipitation from a highly carbonate supersaturated seawater. Its delta(13)C Composition (delta(13)C=0 parts per thousand PDB) is 4 parts per thousand to 5 parts per thousand PDB lower than the typical Upper Permian values (4 parts per thousand to 5 parts per thousand PDB), suggesting the involvement of massive amounts of gas hydrate CH(4) (delta(13)C = -60 parts per thousand PDB). The temporal coincidence of the cement layer with the PTB suggests that the process that promoted seafloor cementation was also responsible for the biological crisis. A cementation model is developed based on accumulation-dissociation cycle of gas hydrates which also explains the mass extinction at the PTB. The Upper Permian accumulation period of gas hydrates ended abruptly adjacent to the PTB and the dissociation event began releasing 3.2 to 4.7 X 10(18) g CH(4) into the ocean. Oxidation of CH(4) in the water column created a seawater that was charged with CO(2) (an oceanic acid bath) and had lower than normal O(2) content (but not anoxic). This oceanic acid bath first dissolved suspended fine-grained carbonate particles and small calcareous organisms, followed by extensive dissolution of platform carbonates raising Ca(2+) and HCO(3)(-) concentrations of seawater. When the release of CH(4) declined, the acid-bath ocean became a soda ocean precipitating massive amount of seafloor cements observed globally at the PTB. The study suggests that prior to cement precipitation, the PTB ocean was charged with CO(2), warm, had low oxygen, high Ca(2+) and high HCO(3)(-) concentrations. These conditions collectively created stressful conditions causing the marine mass mortality. The leakage of CH(4) to the atmosphere produced a super-hot climate resulting in the biological devastation on land. The proposed kill mechanism is developed on the basis of the physical clue-the cement layer-left behind by the killing process-the change in ocean chemistry. The accumulation-dissociation cycles of gas hydrates also explain the delta(13)C pattern of marine carbonates and the periodicity of mass extinction events during the Phanerozoic. Accumulation periods were long (5 to 20 My) providing favorable conditions for ecosystem development (Pardeess phase). The dissociation events were short and catastrophic (10 to 500 Ky) causing low oxygenation, super-hot climate, and biological devastation (Doozakh phase). It appears that most mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic have been related to the internal working of the Earth system. During the Phanerozoic, methane has played the role of the Deev Jahi-a female demon in Persian mythology-whose task is to attack the Earth every so often to kill life on land and in sea.

We here use a sample-population approach, to develop a high-resolution conodont biostratigraphic framework for the Lopingian of Iran based on a re-examination of collections studied by Sweet from the Kuh-e-Ali Bashi area, northwest Iran; samples from the Abadeh C section and a nearby Permian-Triassic boundary section in the Abadeh area; and on published data. Six Wuchiapingian conodont zones, the Clarkina dukouensis, C. asymmetrica, C. leveni, C. guangyuanensis, C. transcaucasica and C. orientalis zones, and eight Changhsingian conodont zones, the Clarkina wangi, C. subcarinata, C. changxingensis, C. bachmanni, C. nodosa, C. yini, C. abadehensis and C. hauschkei zones, are described and figured. Diagnoses of ontogenetic characteristics to population variations of all the zone-naming species are re-described based on a sample-population taxonomic concept. The high-resolution Lopingian conodont zonation in Iran is closely correlative with its counterpart in South China. However, slightly different evolutionary trends in Clarkina populations existed at the very end of the Changhsingian in Iran and South China. This reflects a geographical cline and/or facies dependence and endemism in Clarkina populations rather than stratigraphic incompleteness of sections in either Iran or South China.

Direct evidence for the presence of terrigenous DOM in the open ocean has been found only in dissolved humic substances isolated from surface waters of the eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean(2), Here we report the detection of low concentrations of Lignin-a biopolymer found only in terrestrial vegetation-in DOM collected from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, indicating that terrigenous DOM is distributed throughout the ocean water column. Higher lignin concentrations in Atlantic waters, relative to Pacific waters, reflect terrigenous DOM concentrations that are 2.6 times higher in the Atlantic. This finding is consistent with the 3.6-times greater riverine water-discharge to the Atlantic Ocean(3,4), and with known patterns of ocean circulation(5), It appears that terrigenous DOM comprises only a small fraction (0.7-2.4{\%}) of the total DOM in the ocean, and that its oceanic residence time (21-132 yr) is much shorter than that of marine DOM(6,7). The regeneration of nutrients during rapid cycling of terrigenous DOM could contribute to high rates of primary production in the coastal ocean.},

abstract = {Carbon dioxide is an essential atmospheric component in martian climate models that attempt to reconcile a faint young sun with planetwide evidence of liquid water in the Noachian and Early Hesperian. In this study, we use mineral and contextual sedimentary environmental data measured by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Rover Curiosity to estimate the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (PCO2) coinciding with a long-lived lake system in Gale Crater at ∼3.5 Ga. A reaction-transport model that simulates mineralogy observed within the Sheepbed member at Yellowknife Bay (YKB), by coupling mineral equilibria with carbonate precipitation kinetics and rates of sedimentation, indicates atmospheric PCO2 levels in the 10s mbar range. At such low PCO2 levels, existing climate models are unable to warm Hesperian Mars anywhere near the freezing point of water, and other gases are required to raise atmospheric pressure to prevent lake waters from being lost to the atmosphere. Thus, either lacustrine features of Gale formed in a cold environment by a mechanism yet to be determined, or the climate models still lack an essential component that would serve to elevate surface temperatures, at least locally, on Hesperian Mars. Our results also impose restrictions on the potential role of atmospheric CO2 in inferred warmer conditions and valley network formation of the late Noachian.},

abstract = {This book, and the associated software, have grown out of the author's work in the ﬁeld of local regression over the past several years. The book is designed to be useful for both theoretical work and in applications. Most chapters contain distinct sections introducing methodology, computing and practice, and theoretical results. The methodological and practice sections should be accessible to readers with a sound background in statistical methods and in particular regression, for example at the level of Draper and Smith (1981). The theoretical sections require a greater understanding of calculus, matrix algebra and real analysis, generally at the level found in advanced undergraduate courses. Applications are given from a wide variety of ﬁelds, ranging from actuarial science to sports. The extent, and relevance, of early work in smoothing is not widely appreciated, even within the research community. Chapter 1 attempts to redress the problem. Many ideas that are central to modern work on smoothing: local polynomials, the bias-variance trade-oﬀ, equivalent kernels, likelihood models and optimality results can be found in literature dating to the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The core methodology of this book appears in Chapters 2 through 5. These chapters introduce the local regression method in univariate and multivariate settings, and extensions to local likelihood and density estimation. Basic theoretical results and diagnostic tools such as cross validation are introduced along the way. Examples illustrate the implementation of the methods using the locfit software. The remaining chapters discuss a variety of applications and advanced topics: classiﬁcation, survival data, bandwidth selection issues, computa- tion and asymptotic theory. Largely, these chapters are independent of each other, so the reader can pick those of most interest. Most chapters include a short set of exercises. These include theoretical results; details of proofs; extensions of the methodology; some data analysis examples and a few research problems. But the real test for the methods is whether they provide useful answers in applications. The best exercise for every chapter is to ﬁnd datasets of interest, and try the methods out! The literature on mathematical aspects of smoothing is extensive, and coverage is necessarily selective. I attempt to present results that are of most direct practical relevance. For example, theoretical motivation for standard error approximations and conﬁdence bands is important; the reader should eventually want to know precisely what the error estimates represent, rather than simply asuming software reports the right answers (this applies to any model and software; not just local regression and locfit!). On the other hand, asymptotic methods for boundary correction receive no coverage, since local regression provides a simpler, more intuitive and more general approach to achieve the same result. Along with the theory, we also attempt to introduce understanding of the results, along with their relevance. Examples of this include the discussion of non-identiﬁability of derivatives (Section 6.1) and the problem of bias estimation for conﬁdence bands and bandwidth selectors (Chapters 9 and 10).},

abstract = {Based on seven measured sections from Svalbard, the marine strata of the Permian Kapp Starostin Formation are arranged into seven transgressive–regressive sequences (TR1–TR7) of c . 4–5 Ma average duration, each bound by a maximum regressive surface. Facies, including heterozoan-dominated limestones, spiculitic cherts, sandstones, siltstones and shales, record deposition within inner, middle and outer shelf areas. The lowermost sequence, TR1, comprises most of the basal V{\o}ringen Member, which records a transgression across the Gipshuken Formation following a hiatus of unknown duration. Temperate to cold, storm-dominated facies established in inner to middle shelf areas between the latest Artinskian and Kungurian. Prolonged deepening during sequences TR2 and TR3 was succeeded by a long-term shallowing-upward trend that lasted until the latest Permian (TR4–TR7). A major depocentre existed in central and western Spitsbergen while to the north, Dickson Land remained a shallow platform, leading to a shallow homoclinal ramp in NE Spitsbergen and Nordaustlandet. The Middle Permian extinction (late Capitanian) is recorded near the base of TR6 in deeper parts of the basin only; elsewhere this sequence is not recorded. Likewise the youngest sequence, TR7, extending to the upper formational contact of latest Permian age, is found only in the basin depocentre. Comparison with age-equivalent strata in the Sverdrup Basin of Canada reveals a remarkably similar depositional history, with, for example, two (third-order) sea-level cycles recorded in the Late Permian of both regions, in keeping with the global record. Sequence stratigraphy may therefore be a powerful correlative tool for onshore and offshore Permian deposits across NW Pangaea.},

Given reasonable assumptions about the isotopic composition of Cretaceous seawater, our results suggest that middle bathyal water temperatures at Blake Nose increased from similar to12 degreesC in the late Albian through middle Cenomanian to a maximum of 20 degreesC during the latest Cenomanian and earliest Turonian. Bottom waters were again similar to12 degreesC during the middle Campanian and cooled to a minimum of 9 T during the Maastrichtian. Correlative middle bathyal foraminifera from other ocean basins yield paleotemperature estimates that are very similar to those from Blake Nose. Comparison of global bottom-water temperatures and latitudinal thermal gradients suggests that global climate changed from a warm greenhouse state during the late Albian through late Cenomanian to a hot greenhouse phase during the latest Cenomanian through early Campanian, then to cool greenhouse conditions during the mid-Campanian through Maastrichtian.},

abstract = {The cause of the great Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary mass extinctions remains unknown. A crucial step in identifying the cause involves a precise timing of the mass extinction interval (MEI) in order to reconstruct the pattern of biotic evolution and the chronologic record of potential triggers. Here we present an estimate of the P-T boundary MEI duration based on astronomical tuning of multiple cyclic sedimentary records. Magnetic susceptibility data from Shangsi, southern China, provide evidence for strong 405 k.y. orbital eccentricity forcing throughout the P-T boundary interval. Radioisotope dating combined with 405 k.y. tuning provides an absolute time scale through the P-T boundary interval at unprecedented high resolution. An estimated similar to 700 k.y. duration for the MEI at Shangsi is supported by eccentricity tuned estimates of four other sections in China and Austria. In addition, at Shangsi, the onset of mass extinction occurred shortly following a coincidence of minima in the observed similar to 1.5 m.y., 405 k.y., and similar to 100 k.y. cycles. A change in the magnetic susceptibility response to astronomical forcing occurred just prior to the onset of extinction, with reduced 100-k.y.-scale cyclicity continuing into the Early Triassic for more than 2 m.y.},

abstract = {The formation of Fe(III) oxides in natural environ-ments occurs in the presence of natural organic matter (OM), resulting in the formation of OM–mineral complexes that form through adsorption or coprecipitation processes. Thus, microbial Fe(III) reduction in natural environments most of-ten occurs in the presence of OM–mineral complexes rather than pure Fe(III) minerals. This study investigated to what extent does the content of adsorbed or coprecipitated OM on ferrihydrite influence the rate of Fe(III) reduction by She-wanella oneidensis MR-1, a model Fe(III)-reducing microor-ganism, in comparison to a microbial consortium extracted from the acidic, Fe-rich Schl{\"{o}}ppnerbrunnen fen. We found that increased OM content led to increased rates of microbial Fe(III) reduction by S. oneidensis MR-1 in contrast to ear-lier findings with the model organism Geobacter bremensis. Ferrihydrite–OM coprecipitates were reduced slightly faster than ferrihydrites with adsorbed OM. Surprisingly, the com-plex microbial consortia stimulated by a mixture of electrons donors (lactate, acetate, and glucose) mimics S. oneiden-sis under the same experimental Fe(III)-reducing conditions suggesting similar mechanisms of electron transfer whether or not the OM is adsorbed or coprecipitated to the mineral surfaces. We also followed potential shifts of the microbial community during the incubation via 16S rRNA gene se-quence analyses to determine variations due to the presence of adsorbed or coprecipitated OM–ferrihydrite complexes in contrast to pure ferrihydrite. Community profile analy-ses showed no enrichment of typical model Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, such as Shewanella or Geobacter sp., but an en-richment of fermenters (e.g., Enterobacteria) during pure ferrihydrite incubations which are known to use Fe(III) as an electron sink. Instead, OM–mineral complexes favored the enrichment of microbes including Desulfobacteria and Pelosinus sp., both of which can utilize lactate and acetate as an electron donor under Fe(III)-reducing conditions. In sum-mary, this study shows that increasing concentrations of OM in OM–mineral complexes determines microbial Fe(III) re-duction rates and shapes the microbial community structure involved in the reductive dissolution of ferrihydrite. Simi-larities observed between the complex Fe(III)-reducing mi-crobial consortia and the model Fe(III)-reducer S. oneiden-sis MR-1 suggest electron-shuttling mechanisms dominate in OM-rich environments, including soils, sediments, and fens, where natural OM interacts with Fe(III) oxides during min-eral formation.},

abstract = {The geochemistry of seep gases is useful for an understanding of the
local petroleum system. Here it was tested whether individual light
hydrocarbons in seep gases are representatively entrapped in authigenic
carbonates that formed near active seep sites. If applicable, it would
be possible to extract geochemical information not only on the origin
but also on the thermal maturity of the hydrocarbon source rocks from
the gases entrapped in carbonates in the past. Respective data could be
used for a better understanding of paleoenvironments and might directly
serve as calibration point for, amongst others, petroleum system
modeling. For this approach, (sub)-recent seep carbonates from the Black
Sea (Paleodnjepr region and Batumi seep area), two sites of the Campeche
Knoll region in the Gulf of Mexico, and the Venere mud volcano
(Mediterranean Sea) were selected. These seep carbonates derive from
sites for which geochemical data on the currently seeping gases exist.
During treatment with phosphoric acid, methane and higher hydrocarbons
were released from all carbonates, but in low concentrations.
Compositional studies demonstrate that the ratio of methane to the sum
of higher hydrocarbons (C-1/(C-2+C-3)) is (partly strongly) positively
biased in the entrapped gas fraction. delta C-13 values of C-1 were
determined for all samples and, for the samples from the Gulf of Mexico
and the Mediterranean Sea, also of C-2 and C-3. The present dataset from
six seep sites indicates that information on the seeped methane can
be-although with a scatter of several permil-recorded in seep carbonate
matrices, but other valuable information like the composition and delta
C-13 of ethane and propane appears to be modified or lost during, for
example, enclosure or at an early stage of diagenesis.},

The RubisCO genes (cbbL and cbbS) were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Enzyme was purified via ammonium sulfate precipitation, and the optimum pH and temperature, as well as Michaelis-Menton constants, were determined radiometrically. The degree to which this RubisCO discriminates against 13CO2 during fixation was determined by the high-precision substrate depletion method. Purified enzyme had a pH optimum of 7.5, was most active between 20°C and 30°C, had a moderate Vmax (0.41 µmol min-1 mg protein-1), and had the highest KCO2 value (0.75 mmol L-1) for a form I RubisCO characterized to date. The $\epsilon$ value, $\epsilon$ = 1,000[(k12/k13) - 1], for the enzyme was determined to be 24.0‰ (95{\%} C.I. = 22.2-25.6‰), within the range observed for other form I RubisCOs. This $\epsilon$ value is a critical baseline for interpreting the $\delta$13C values of marine environmental samples, particularly those collected from the open ocean, where P. marinus is responsible for a substantial fraction of carbon fixation.},

abstract = {The evolution of Earth's biota is intimately linked to the oxygenation of the oceans and atmosphere. We use the isotopic composition and concentration of molybdenum (Mo) in sedimentary rocks to explore this relationship. Our results indicate two episodes of global ocean oxygenation. The first coincides with the emergence of the Ediacaran fauna, including large, motile bilaterian animals, ca. 550-560 million year ago (Ma), reinforcing previous geochemical indications that Earth surface oxygenation facilitated this radiation. The second, perhaps larger, oxygenation took place around 400 Ma, well after the initial rise of animals and, therefore, suggesting that early metazoans evolved in a relatively low oxygen environment. This later oxygenation correlates with the diversification of vascular plants, which likely contributed to increased oxygenation through the enhanced burial of organic carbon in sediments. It also correlates with a pronounced radiation of large predatory fish, animals with high oxygen demand. We thereby couple the redox history of the atmosphere and oceans to major events in animal evolution.},

abstract = {Platinum metals are depleted in the earth's crust relative to their cosmic abundance; concentrations of these elements in deep-sea sediments may thus indicate influxes of extraterrestrial material. Deep-sea limestones exposed in Italy, Denmark, and New Zealand show iridium increases of about 30, 160, and 20 times, respectively, above the background level at precisely the time of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinctions, 65 million years ago. Reasons are given to indicate that this iridium is of extraterrestrial origin, but did not come from a nearby supernova. A hypothesis is suggested which accounts for the extinctions and the iridium observations. Impact of a large earth-crossing asteroid would inject about 60 times the object's mass into the atmosphere as pulverized rock; a fraction of this dust would stay in the stratosphere for several years and be distributed worldwide. The resulting darkness would suppress photosynthesis, and the expected biological consequences match quite closely the extinctions observed in the paleontological record. One prediction of this hypothesis has been verified: the chemical composition of the boundary clay, which is thought to come from the stratospheric dust, is markedly different from that of clay mixed with the Cretaceous and Tertiary limestones, which are chemically similar to each other. Four different independent estimates of the diameter of the asteroid give values that lie in the range 10 +/- 4 kilometers.},

abstract = {The end-Triassic mass extinction is associated with a large negative carbon isotope excursion, which has been interpreted as reflecting the rapid injection of13C depleted CO2or methane associated with the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. However, in a number of sections in central Europe, the negative excursion is associated with a carbonate-poor lithology, and the most isotopically depleted values are associated with the lowest percent carbonate, raising the possibility of a lithologic control on $\delta$13Ccarb.Here we test the uniqueness of the relationship between the carbonate-poor lithology and the $\delta$13C signal by comparing the geochemistry of the extinction marl with two Upper Triassic carbonate-poor beds from lower positions within the same stratigraphic sections. We find that the extinction and non-extinction marls overlap nearly completely in terms of their carbonate content, but differ substantially in their isotopic trends. The extinction marl sections show strong depletions in the $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O of carbonate, and enrichment in $\delta$13C of bulk organic carbon, while the non-extinction marls show almost no change in these metrics. Accordingly, the difference in isotopic content must lie in differences inherent to the beds themselves and the circumstances of their deposition and early diagenesis. Although a range of primary drivers for the isotopic trends is possible, an acidification origin for the marl, and oceanic origin for the carbon isotope excursion in carbonate are compatible with our data and supported by the broader context of the extinction.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction horizon is marked by an abrupt shift in style of carbonate sedimentation and a negative excursion in the carbon isotope (delta(13)C) composition of carbonate minerals. Several extinction scenarios consistent with these observations have been put forward. Secular variation in the calcium isotope (delta(44/40)Ca) composition of marine sediments provides a tool for distinguishing among these possibilities and thereby constraining the causes of mass extinction. Here we report delta(44/40)Ca across the Permian-Triassic boundary from marine limestone in south China. The delta(44/40)Ca exhibits a transient negative excursion of approximately 0.3 per thousand over a few hundred thousand years or less, which we interpret to reflect a change in the global delta(44/40)Ca composition of seawater. CO(2)-driven ocean acidification best explains the coincidence of the delta(44/40)Ca excursion with negative excursions in the delta(13)C of carbonates and organic matter and the preferential extinction of heavily calcified marine animals. Calcium isotope constraints on carbon cycle calculations suggest that the average delta(13)C of CO(2) released was heavier than -28 per thousand and more likely near -15 per thousand; these values indicate a source containing substantial amounts of mantle- or carbonate-derived carbon. Collectively, the results point toward Siberian Trap volcanism as the trigger of mass extinction.},

abstract = {Bioturbation, the physical and chemical mixing of sediment by burrowing animals, exerts an important control on the character of modern marine sediments and biogeochemical cycling. Here we show that the mixing of sediments on marine shelves remained limited until at least the late Silurian, 120 million years after the Precambrian–Cambrian transition. We present ichnological, stratigraphic and taphonomic data from a range of lower Phanerozoic siliciclastic successions spanning four palaeocontinents. The protracted development of the sediment mixed layer is also consistent with sulphur data and global sulphur model simulations. The slow increase in the intensity of bioturbation in the sediment record suggests that evolutionary advances in sediment colonization outpaced advances in sediment mixing. We conclude that ecosystem restructuring caused by the onset of significant infaunal mobile deposit feeding (‘bulldozing') occurred well after both the Cambrian Explosion and the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event.},

Multilevel Modeling Using R provides you with a helpful guide to conducting multilevel data modeling using the R software environment. After reviewing standard linear models, the authors present the basics of multilevel models and explain how to fit these models using R. They then show how to employ multilevel modeling with longitudinal data and demonstrate the valuable graphical options in R. The book also describes models for categorical dependent variables in both single level and multilevel data. The book concludes with Bayesian fitting of multilevel models. For those new to R, the appendix provides an introduction to this system that covers basic R knowledge necessary to run the models in the book. Through the R code and detailed explanations provided, this book gives you the tools to launch your own investigations in multilevel modeling and gain insight into your research.},

Is this a conflict? A review of different methods of tabulating data from the Sepkoski database reveals 18 intervals during the Phanerozoic have peaks of both magnitude and rate of extinction that appear in each tabulating scheme. These intervals all fit Sepkoski's definition of mass extinction. However, they vary widely in timing and effect of extinction, demonstrating that mass extinctions are not a homogeneous group of events. No consensus has been reached on the kill mechanism for any marine mass extinction. In fact, adequate data on timing in ecologic, rather than geologic, time and on geographic and environmental distribution of extinction have not yet been systematically compiled for any extinction event.},

However, scaling laws developed for plants and animals often go untested or fail to hold for microorganisms. As a result, it is unclear whether scaling laws of biodiversity span evolutionarily distant domains of life that encompass all modes of metabolism and scales of abundance. Using a global-scale compilation of {\~{}}35,000 sites and {\~{}}5.6{\textperiodcentered}106 species, we demonstrate similar rates of scaling in commonness and rarity across microorganisms and macroscopic plants and animals. We document a universal dominance scaling law that holds across 30 orders of magnitude, an unprecedented expanse that predicts the abundance of dominant ocean bacteria. In combining this scaling law with the lognormal model of species abundance, we predict that Earth is home to {\~{}}1012 microbial species. This estimate is also supported by the microbial richness scaling relationship we derive from the largest ever inventory of high-throughput molecular data. Microbial biodiversity seems greater than ever anticipated yet predictable from the smallest to the largest microbiome.},

abstract = {The Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; {\~{}}56 Ma) is associated with abrupt climate change, carbon cycle perturbation, ocean acidification, as well as biogeographic shifts in marine and terrestrial biota that were largely reversed as the climatic transient waned. We report a clear exception to the behavior of the PETM as a reversing climatic transient in the eastern North Atlantic (Deep-Sea Drilling Project Site 401, Bay of Biscay) where the PETM initiates a greatly prolonged environmental change compared to other places on Earth where records exist. The observed environmental perturbation extended well past the $\delta$13C recovery phase and up to 650 kyr after the PETM onset according to our extraterrestrial 3He-based age-model. We observe a strong decoupling of planktic foraminiferal $\delta$18O and Mg/Ca values during the PETM $\delta$13C recovery phase, which in combination with results from helium isotopes and clay mineralogy, suggests that the PETM triggered a hydrologic change in western Europe that increased freshwater flux and the delivery of weathering products to the eastern North Atlantic. This state change persisted long after the carbon-cycle perturbation had stopped. We hypothesize that either long-lived continental drainage patterns were altered by enhanced hydrological cycling induced by the PETM, or alternatively that the climate system in the hinterland area of Site 401 was forced into a new climate state that was not easily reversed in the aftermath of the PETM. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {It is widely believed that contemporary climate determines large-scale patterns of species richness. An alternative view proposes that species richness reflects biotic responses to historic climate changes. These competing "contemporary climate" vs "historic climate" hypotheses have been vigorously debated without reaching consensus. Here, we test the proposition that European species richness of reptiles and amphibians is driven by climate changes in the Quaternary. We find that climate stability between the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the present day is a better predictor of species richness than contemporary climate; and that the 0 degrees C isotherm of the LGM delimits the distributions of narrow-ranging species, whereas the current 0 degrees C isotherm limits the distributions of wide-ranging species. Our analyses contradict previous studies of large-scale species richness patterns and support the view that "historic climate" can contribute to current species richness independently of and at least as much as contemporary climate.},

abstract = {The search for early Earth biological activity is hindered by the scarcity of the rock record. The very few exposed sedimentary rocks have all been affected by secondary processes such as metamorphism and weathering, which might have distorted morphological microfossils and biogenic minerals beyond recognition and have altered organic matter to kerogen. The search for biological activity in such rocks therefore relies entirely on chemical, molecular or isotopic indicators. A powerful tool used for this purpose is the stable isotope signature of elements related to life (C, N, S, Fe). It provides key informations not only on the metabolic pathways operating at the time of the sediment deposition, but more globally on the biogeochemical cycling of these elements and thus on the Earth's surface evolution. Here, we review the basis of stable isotope biogeochemistry for these isotopic systems. Rather than an exhaustive approach, we address some examples to illustrate how they can be used as biosignatures of early life and as proxies for its environment, while keeping in mind what their limitations are. We then focus on the covariations among these isotopic systems during the Archean time period to show that they convey important information both on the evolution of the redox state of the terrestrial surface reservoirs and on co-occurring ecosystems in the Archean.},

Here, we revisit that treatment and expand it to branching networks representative of biological sulfur disproportionation, in an attempt to understand multiple sulfur isotope fractionations associated with that metabolism. We use this context to interpret experimental data for both sulfate reducers and sulfur compound disproportionators. We explore the types of information about material flow through these metabolic processes that can be extracted by using multiple sulfur isotope data. The different multiple sulfur isotope relationships ($\Delta$33S′ and $\lambda$) allow various metabolic processes to be distinguished from one another, even when $\delta$34S fractionations are similar, providing a tool that can be used to interpret and identify different types of biological sulfur fractionations in the geologic record.},

This record shows a steady cooling trend through the Early Ordovician reaching modern equatorial temperatures that were sustained throughout the Middle and Late Ordovician. This favorable climate regime implies not only that the oxygen isotopic composition of Ordovician seawater was similar to that of today, but also that climate played an overarching role in promoting the unprecedented increases in biodiversity that characterized this period.},

abstract = {The metabolic activities of microbial mats have likely regulated biogeochemical cycling over most of Earth's history. However, the relationship between metabolic activity and the establishment of isotopic geochemical gradients in these mats remains poorly constrained. Here we present a parallel microgeochemical and microbiological study of micron-scale sulfur cycling within hypersaline microbial mats from Guerrero Negro, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Dissolved sulfide within the mats was captured on silver discs and analyzed for its abundance and delta(34)S isotopic composition using high-resolution secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS). These results were compared to sulfide and oxygen microelectrode profiles. Two-dimensional microgeochemical mapping revealed well-defined laminations in sulfide concentration (on scales from 1 to 200 microm), trending toward increased sulfide concentrations at depth. Sulfide delta(34)S decreased from approximately +10 per thousand to -20 per thousand in the uppermost 3 mm and oscillated repeatedly between -10 per thousand and -30 per thousand down to a depth of 8 mm. These variations are attributed to spatially variable bacterial sulfate reduction within the mat. A parallel examination of the spatial distribution of known sulfate-reducing bacteria within the family Desulfobacteraceae was conducted using catalyzed reporter deposition fluorescence in situ hybridization. Significant concentrations of Desulfobacteraceae were observed in both oxic and anoxic zones of the mat and occurred in several distinct layers, in large aggregates and heterogeneously dispersed as single cells throughout. The spatial distribution of these microorganisms is consistent with the variation in sulfide concentration and isotopic composition we observed. The parallel application of the methodologies developed here can shed light on micron-scale sulfur cycling within microbially dominated sedimentary environments.},

abstract = {Challenger Mound, a 150-m-high cold-water coral mound on the eastern flank of the Porcupine Seabight off SW Ireland, was drilled during Expedition 307 of the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP). Retrieved cores offer unique insight into an archive of Quaternary paleo-environmental change, long-term coral mound development, and the diagenetic alteration of these carbonate fabrics over time. To characterize biogeochemical carbon-iron-sulfur transformations in the mound sediments, the contents of dithionite- and HCl-extractable iron phases, iron monosulfide and pyrite, and acid-extractable calcium, magnesium, manganese, and strontium were determined. Additionally, the stable isotopic compositions of pore-water sulfate and solid-phase reduced sulfur compounds were analyzed. Sulfate penetrated through the mound sequence and into the underlying Miocene sediments, where a sulfate-methane transition zone was identified. Small sulfate concentration decreases ({\textless}7 mM) within the top 40 m of the mound suggested slow net rates of present-day organoclastic sulfate reduction. Increasing $\delta$(34)S-sulfate values due to microbial sulfate reduction mirrored the decrease in sulfate concentrations. This process was accompanied by oxygen isotope exchange with water that was indicated by increasing $\delta$(18)O-sulfate values, reaching equilibrium with pore-water at depth. Below 50 mbsf, sediment intervals with strong (34)S-enriched imprints on chromium-reducible sulfur (pyrite S), high degree-of-pyritization values, and semi-lithified diagenetic carbonate-rich layers characterized by poor coral preservation, were observed. These layers provided evidence for the occurrence of enhanced microbial sulfate-reducing activity in the mound in the past during periods of rapid mound aggradation and subsequent intervals of non-deposition or erosion when geochemical fronts remained stationary. During these periods, especially during the Early Pleistocene, elevated sulfate reduction rates facilitated the consumption of reducible iron oxide phases, coral dissolution, and the subsequent formation of carbonate cements.},

abstract = {The microfacies sequence in the key interval of Beds 24-29 of the Meishan section comprehensively recorded the geological events during the Permian-Triassic transition, including the anoxia, storm disturbance, hard-ground/firm-ground form, volcanic eruption, weathering input, and microbialite development. This investigation of event sequences on the microfacies provided synthetically some clues to clarifying the previously proposed mechanisms of the end-Permian extinction. The deposit succession in Bed 24 of the Changxing Formation was developed dominantly with organic-rich lamina, but interrupted intermittently by storm disturbances. It indicates characteristically a stagnated, stratified and anoxic ocean during the latest Permian. The latest Permian transgression occurred rapidly at the top of Bed 24d and was characterized by the hard-ground interface. Abundant clay mineral of illite indicates the occurrence of persistent weathering of continental volcanics and then buried in ocean throughout this key Permo-Triassic transitional interval. However, the "boundary ash clay" of Bed 25 yielding normal grading of hyaloclastite was the result of precipitation of volcanic dusts. The firm-ground substrate in Unit 27-2 was lithe and excavated intensively by trace fossil Glossifungites; it means also the occurrence of the earliest Triassic rapid transgression and coincides with the first appearance of conodont Hindeodus parvus. Dune-shaped microbialite in Unit 27-5 defines biostratigraphically that its development, especially in the carbonate platform of South China, should correspond to the earliest Triassic; and it also indicates the final episode of the end-Permian extinction event. 2009 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

abstract = {The end-Permian biotic crisis is commonly associated with rapid and severe climatic changes. These climatic changes are commonly suggested to have originated from solid Earth carbon degassing (leading to global warming), but aerosol- and ash-induced cooling induced by lava degassing has been suggested as well. The application of an Earth System Model of Intermediate Complexity has enabled a visualisation of the major climatic shifts on the supercontinent Pangaea caused by rapid temperature changes due to changed radiative properties from greenhouse gases. The reconstructed reference climate was validated by latest Permian climate indicative sediments to investigate the possible climatic shifts. From a set of 22 reconstructions which varied with temperature a minimum global annual mean temperature of 18.2 °C for the late Permian climate prior to the climatic perturbation event was determined. Starting from this pre-event setup, global warming and global cooling scenarios were simulated. The response of the end Permian climate system to temperature increase and decrease show marked differences. While global cooling is followed by major climatic changes in the high latitudes and replacement of boreal biomes by tundra and polar frost, the changes during global warming are less pronounced with only locally increasing aridity compensated by humidisation in other regions. The different behaviour of the climatic belts under warm and cold conditions is accompanied by different climate sensitivities caused by different strength of the snow cover–albedo feedback. Thus, changes in the energy balance of the latest Permian surface–troposphere system have a 30{\%} higher perturbation potential during cold climate conditions than during warmhouse conditions. Therefore substantial global cooling resulting in coldhouse climate conditions and an annual global mean temperature below 18 °C is more efficient in perturbing the Earth palaeoclimate during the end-Permian warmhouse. The results suggest that global cooling mechanisms as injection of sulphur aerosols and ash particles from the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province into the Late Permian palaeoatmosphere have a higher climate perturbation potential than a warming due to carbon greenhouse gases with a similar magnitude of radiative forcing.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction removed more than 80{\%} of marine genera. Ammonoid cephalopods were among the organisms most affected by this crisis. The analysis of a global diversity data set of ammonoid genera covering about 106 million years centered on the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) shows that Triassic ammonoids actually reached levels of diversity higher than in the Permian less than 2 million years after the PTB. The data favor a hierarchical rather than logistic model of diversification coupled with a niche incumbency hypothesis. This explosive and nondelayed diversification contrasts with the slow and delayed character of the Triassic biotic recovery as currently illustrated for other, mainly benthic groups such as bivalves and gastropods. },

abstract = {In ancient hothouses lacking ice sheets, the origins of large, million-year (myr)-scale sea-level oscillations remain a mystery, challenging current models of sea-level change. To address this mystery, we develop a sedimentary noise model for sea-level changes that simultaneously estimates geologic time and sea level from astronomically forced marginal marine stratigraphy. The noise model involves two complementary approaches: dynamic noise after orbital tuning (DYNOT) and lag-1 autocorrelation coefficient ($\rho$1). Noise modeling of Lower Triassic marine slope stratigraphy in South China reveal evidence for global sea-level variations in the Early Triassic hothouse that are anti-phased with continental water storage variations in the Germanic Basin. This supports the hypothesis that long-period (1-2 myr) astronomically forced water mass exchange between land and ocean reservoirs is a missing link for reconciling geological records and models for sea-level change during non-glacial periods.},

abstract = {Temporal drying of upper soil layers of acidic methanogenic peatlands might divert the flow of reductants from CH4 formation to other electron-accepting processes due to a renewal of alternative electron acceptors. In this study, we evaluated the in situ relevance of Fe(III)-reducing microbial activities in peatlands of a forested catchment that differed in their hydrology. Intermittent seeps reduced sequentially nitrate, Fe(III), and sulfate during periods of water saturation. Due to the acidic soil conditions, released Fe(II) was transported with the groundwater flow and accumulated as Fe(III) in upper soil layers of a lowland fen apparently due to oxidation. Microbial Fe(III) reduction in the upper soil layer accounted for 26.7 and 71.6{\%} of the anaerobic organic carbon mineralization in the intermittent seep and the lowland fen, respectively. In an upland fen not receiving exogenous Fe, Fe(III) reduction contributed only to 6.7{\%}. Fe(II) and acetate accumulated in deeper porewater of the lowland fen with maximum concentrations of 7 and 3 mM, respectively. Both supplemental glucose and acetate stimulated the reduction of Fe(III) indicating that fermentative, incomplete, and complete oxidizers were involved in Fe(II) formation in the acidic fen. Amplification of DNA yielded PCR products specific for Acidiphilium-, Geobacter-, and Geothrix-, but not for Shewanella- or Anaeroromyxobacter- related sequences. Porewater biogeochemistry observed during a 3-year-period suggests that increased drought periods and subsequent intensive rainfalls due to global climate change will further favor Fe(III) and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors due to the storage and enhanced re-oxidation of their reduced compounds in the soil.},

This intracrater lake system probably existed intermittently for thousands to millions of years, implying a relatively wet climate that supplied moisture to the crater rim and transported sediment via streams into the lake basin.

abstract = {The five major mass extinctions identified in 1982 by Raup and Sepkoski have expanded to six, with the suggestion that the Permian-Triassic extinction was a double event. Is there a general explanation for great mass extinctions, or can they result from different triggers, or even from internal system instabilities? The two most-discussed candidates for a general extinction mechanism are impacts and flood-basalt eruptions. A compilation of evidence for impact at the times of mass extinctions shows that this cause is abundantly confirmed in the case of the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction and the late Eocene, which is a time of minor and gradual extinction, but little or no evidence connects other major extinctions to impact. On the other hand, there is a remarkable time correlation between flood basalts and four major extinctions, but no other evidence that flood basalts cause mass extinctions. The evidence for an impact-extinction linkage is strikingly different from that for a connection between flood basalts and extinctions. Flood basalts cover larger areas than craters and their associated thick ejecta blankets, which are thus less likely to be found. Impacts distribute proxies globally at instantaneous time horizons, whereas flood-basalt events are extended in time, and no remote proxies have been recognized. Many global killing mechanisms have been proposed in the case of impacts, but few have been suggested for flood basalts. It is possible that flood basalts are triggered by impact, but it is not obvious how impacts could result from anything other than chance. The hypothesis that impacts are the general cause of mass extinctions has not received supporting evidence, but has not been falsified. The hypothesis that flood basalts are the general cause of mass extinctions is supported by evidence from timing, but is not susceptible to falsification. Other candidates for general extinction causes, especially sea-level changes and system instabilities, would require separate treatment. The question is still very much open.},

abstract = {The use of metals as biosignatures in the fossil stromatolite record requires understanding of the processes controlling the initial metal(loid) incorporation and diagenetic preservation in living microbialites. Here, we report the distribution of metals and the organic fraction within the lithifying microbialite of the hypersaline Big Pond Lake (Bahamas). Using synchrotron-based X-ray microfluorescence, confocal, and biphoton microscopies at different scales (cm-mum) in combination with traditional geochemical analyses, we show that the initial cation sorption at the surface of an active microbialite is governed by passive binding to the organic matrix, resulting in a homogeneous metal distribution. During early diagenesis, the metabolic activity in deeper microbialite layers slows down and the distribution of the metals becomes progressively heterogeneous, resulting from remobilization and concentration as metal(loid)-enriched sulfides, which are aligned with the lamination of the microbialite. In addition, we were able to identify globules containing significant Mn, Cu, Zn, and As enrichments potentially produced through microbial activity. The similarity of the metal(loid) distributions observed in the Big Pond microbialite to those observed in the Archean stromatolites of Tumbiana provides the foundation for a conceptual model of the evolution of the metal distribution through initial growth, early diagenesis, and fossilization of a microbialite, with a potential application to the fossil record.},

abstract = {During the Cretaceous period ({\~{}}145–65 million years ago), there were several periods of global ocean anoxia, each lasting less than one million years. These events, known as ocean anoxic events, were marked by significant increases in organic carbon burial, and are generally attributed to increased primary productivity in surface waters. The details underpinning the initiation, maintenance and termination of these events, however, remain equivocal. Here we present sulphur isotope data spanning the Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (about 94.5 million years ago) from sedimentary rocks in Colorado that were formed in the Western Interior Seaway; this seaway ran north–south, splitting North America during the Cretaceous. Sulphate levels increased rapidly from relatively low background levels at the onset of the event, most likely from the release of sulphur by massive volcanism, and fell during the anoxic event. We infer that the input of sulphate facilitated increased carbon remineralization, which enhanced nutrient recycling and increased global primary productivity, eventually resulting in widespread ocean anoxia. Our scenario indicates that Ocean Anoxic Event 2 may have persisted until sulphate levels were stabilized by the formation and burial of the sulphur mineral pyrite, which returned primary productivity to background levels. We suggest that fluctuations in sulphate levels may have regulated the marine carbon cycle during past periods of low oceanic sulphate concentration.},

abstract = {Authigenic phosphatic laminites enclosed in phosphorite crusts from the shelf off Peru (10 degrees 01' S and 10 degrees 24' S) consist of carbonate fluorapatite layers, which contain abundant sulfide minerals including pyrite (FeS(2)) and sphalerite (ZnS). Low delta(34)S(pyrite) values (average -28.8 per thousand) agree with bacterial sulfate reduction and subsequent pyrite formation. Stable sulfur isotopic compositions of sulfate bound in carbonate fluorapatite are lower than that of sulfate from ambient sea water, suggesting bacterial reoxidation of sulfide by sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. The release of phosphorus and subsequent formation of the autochthonous phosphatic laminites are apparently caused by the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria and associated sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. Following an extraction-phosphorite dissolution-extraction procedure, molecular fossils of sulfate-reducing bacteria (mono-O-alkyl glycerol ethers, di-O-alkyl glycerol ethers, as well as the short-chain branched fatty acids i/ai-C(15:0), i/ai-C(17:0) and 10MeC(16:0)) are found to be among the most abundant compounds. The fact that these molecular fossils of sulfate-reducing bacteria are distinctly more abundant after dissolution of the phosphatic laminite reveals that the lipids are tightly bound to the mineral lattice of carbonate fluorapatite. Moreover, compared with the autochthonous laminite, molecular fossils of sulfate-reducing bacteria are: (1) significantly less abundant and (2) not as tightly bound to the mineral lattice in the other, allochthonous facies of the Peruvian crusts consisting of phosphatic coated grains. These observations confirm the importance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the formation of the phosphatic laminite. Model calculations highlight that organic matter degradation by sulfate-reducing bacteria has the potential to liberate sufficient phosphorus for phosphogenesis.},

A significant group of conodont workers have proposed or accepted a craniate designation for the conodont animal, an interpretation that is increasingly becoming established as accepted “fact”. Against this prevailing trend, our conclusion is based on a revised analysis of traditional morphological features of both discrete conodont elements and apparatuses, histological investigation and a revised cladistic analysis modifying that used in the keystone publication promoted as proof of the hypothesis that conodonts are vertebrates. Our study suggests that conodonts possibly were not even chordates but demonstration of this is beyond the scope of this paper. To summarize, in conodonts there is low cephalization; presence of simple V-shaped trunk musculature and unique large-crystal albid material in the elements; lack of a dermal skeleton including characteristic vertebrate hard tissues of bone, dentine and enamel; lack of odontodes with bone of attachment and a unique pulp system; lack of segmentally-arranged paraxial elements and dermal elements in median fins, all of which supports neither a vertebrate nor a craniate relationship for conodonts.},

Ferrous hydroxide is precipitated from NaOH and FeSO4{\textperiodcentered}7H2O solutions and carbonate ions are added as a Na2CO3solution. For sufficiently large concentrations of sodium carbonate, SO42-ions do not play any role during the oxidation process and, at the end of the first stage of reaction, Fe(OH)2oxidizes into GR1(CO32-). In the second stage of reaction, GR1(CO32-) oxidizes into $\alpha$-FeOOH goethite except when the transformation of ferrous hydroxide is partial, which leads to the formation of magnetite. From the X-ray diffraction analysis of GR1(CO32-), lattice parameters of its hexagonal cell are found to be a = 3.160 ± 0.005 A ̊ and c = 22.45 ± 0.05 A ̊. From the M{\"{o}}ssbauer analysis of the stoichiometric GR1(CO32-), which leads to a Fe2+:Fe3+ratio of 2:1, the chemical formula is established to be: [Fe4(II)Fe2(III)(OH)12][CO3{\textperiodcentered}2H2O]. The 78 K M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectrum of the compound can be fitted with three quadrupole doublets, two Fe2+doublets d1and D2corresponding to isomer shifts (IS) of 1.27 and 1.28 mm s-1and quadrupole splittings (QS) of 2.93 and 2.67 mm s-1, respectively, and one Fe3+doublet D3with an IS of 0.47 mm s-1and QS of 0.43 mm s-1.

From the recording of electrode potential E and the pH of the suspension versus time during the oxidation, the standard free enthalpy of formation of stoichiometric GR1(CO32-) is estimated to be $\Delta$G °f= - 966.250 cal mol-1.

abstract = {The Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) mass-extinction event is marked by isotope anomalies in organic ($\delta$13Corg) and carbonate carbon ($\delta$13Ccarb) reservoirs. These have been attributed to a (rapid) 4-fold rise in pCO2 as a result of massive flood basalt volcanism and/or methane hydrate dissociation. Here we examine the response of marine photosynthetic phytoplankton to the proposed perturbation in the carbon cycle. Our high-resolution micropalaeontological analysis of T-J boundary beds at St Audrie's Bay in Somerset, UK, provides evidence for a bio-calcification crisis that is characterized by (1) extinction and malformation in calcareous nannoplankton and (2) contemporaneous blooms of organic-walled, green algal 'disaster' species which comprise in one case {\textgreater} 70{\%} of the total palynomorph fraction. Blooms of prasinophytes and acritarchs occur at the onset and in association with a prominent negative shift in $\delta$13Corg values close to the first appearance of the Early Jurassic ammonite Psiloceras planorbis. Across the same interval we obtained palaeotemperature and palaeosalinity estimates from oyster low-Mg calcite based on Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca and $\delta$18O records. The results of our palynological and geochemical analyses strongly suggest that shallow marine basins in NW Europe during this period became salinity stratified, inducing anoxic conditions. The T-J boundary event shows similarities with the Permian-Triassic (P-T) mass-extinction event, which was also marked by extensive flood basalt volcanism, negative excursions in carbon isotope records, a bio-calcification crisis, the development of shallow-marine anoxia and mass abundances of acritarchs in the Early Triassic. This leads us to suggest that the proliferation of green algal phytoplankton may be symptomatic of elevated carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and oceans during mass-extinction events. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

We reconstructed a history of sea-level fluctuations for the entire Paleozoic by using stratigraphic sections from pericratonic and cratonic basins. Evaluation of the timing and amplitude of individual sea-level events reveals that the magnitude of change is the most problematic to estimate accurately. The long-term sea level shows a gradual rise through the Cambrian, reaching a zenith in the Late Ordovician, then a short-lived but prominent withdrawal in response to Hirnantian glaciation. Subsequent but decreasingly substantial eustatic highs occurred in the mid-Silurian, near the Middle/Late Devonian boundary, and in the latest Carboniferous. Eustatic lows are recorded in the early Devonian, near the Mississippian/Pennsylvanian boundary, and in the Late Permian. One hundred and seventy-two eustatic events are documented for the Paleozoic, varying in magnitude from a few tens of meters to approximately 125 meters.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic Boundary event at 252.2 Ma marks the largest extinction of marine fauna in the Phanerozoic and there is a wide consensus that the extinction coincided with an intense oceanic anoxic event. The stratotype of the Changhsingian Stage, precisely constrained by the PTB Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) and the GSSP for the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian Boundary, both at Meishan in southern China, is well-documented in respect to geochronology and the pattern of extinction. Here we report secular trends in bulk isotopic parameters and lipid biomarkers in a core spanning 214 m of stratigraphic section across the PTB and through the entire Changhsingian interval. Our analysis of these data, viewed in the context of relative sea level change and strontium isotopes, reveals distinct shifts in paleoenvironmental conditions and profound changes in plankton ecology well before and following the biological extinction event. Specifically, patterns of steroids and triterpenoids indicate a marine plankton community that was heavily dominated by bacteria during the late Wuchiapingian, middle Changhsingian and early Griesbachian stages. Secular trends in aromatic hydrocarbons diagnostic for anoxygenic green sulphur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) identify periods when euxinic conditions extended into the photic zone during the entire Changhsingian stage. Here also, the [delta]15N of organic nitrogen progressively shifted from positive values around + 2 or + 3[per mille sign] to - 1[per mille sign] coincident with a sharp negative excursion in [delta]13Corg and slightly postdating the sharp minimum in [delta]13C values of inorganic carbon that occurs at the top of Bed 24. These results, together the published chronology indicate that conditions unfavourable for aerobiosis existed in the marine photic zone at Meishan for 1.5 million years prior to the main phase of the biological extinction. The induction of marine euxinic conditions, worldwide, at the end of the Permian was likely a consequence of the aggregation of Pangea and the uplift, weathering and transport of nutrients to the ocean well in advance of the PTB. The protracted and widespread nature of the ensuing oceanic anoxic event suggests a causal association with the mass extinction.},

We conclude that pyrite is formed mainly within the redoxcline where sulfur cycling imparts a distinct isotopic signature compared to dissolved sulfide in the deep anoxic water. This conclusion is consistent with our previous study of sulfur species and chemoautotrophic production, which suggests that reaction of sulfide with reactive iron is an important pathway for sulfide oxidation and sulfur intermediate formation near the interface. Pyrite and elemental sulfur distributions favor a pathway of pyrite formation via the reaction of FeS with polysulfides or particulate elemental sulfur near the interface. A comparison of thermodynamic predictions with actual concentration profiles for iron sulfides leads us to argue that microbes may mediate this precipitation. ?? 2010.},

The oxygen isotope shift coincides with the negative shift in carbon isotope ratios of carbonates, suggesting that the addition of isotopically light carbon to the ocean-atmosphere system by Siberian Traps volcanism and related processes resulted in higher greenhouse gas levels and global warming. The major temperature rise started immediately before the main extinction phase, with maximum and harmful temperatures documented in the latest Permian (Meishan: bed 27). The coincidence of climate warming and the main pulse of extinction suggest that global warming was one of the causes of the collapse of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems.

Evidence of ice rafting, not of the best quality but including penetration structures in adjacent shale, is restricted to one locality in mudrocks of the Kolyma River area, which are tentatively assigned to the middle to late Bathonian. Marked seasonality with freezing winters therefore may have characterized this time, in accord with GCM results suggesting strong seasonality in the Jurassic high latitudes. The evolution of Jurassic climate is still to be defined, however, as other reports of clasts in Bajocian-Tithonian mudrocks in the region remain unevaluated.},

abstract = {The St. Audrie's Bay section in west Somerset comprises the uppermost Mercia Mudstone Group, the Penarth Group and the basal Lias Group and includes a candidate Global Stratotype Section and Point for the base of the Jurassic. The magnetostratigraphy has been evaluated through 122 m of this section at 147 stratigraphic levels, which range in age from mid-Norian to earliest Hettangian. In red dolomitic mudstones, the remanence is carried predominantly by haematite, whereas in non-red lithologies, it is mostly carried by magnetite. The mean virtual geomagnetic poles fall near the mean Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic apparent polar wander track and display the start of the northeast-directed track typical of the Jurassic. The magnetostratigraphy comprises nine major magnetozones, five of normal polarity and four reversed, together with several minor magnetozones. In the Mercia Mudstone Group, the 68 m of the Twyning Mudstone Formation examined includes three major normal magnetozones (SA2n, SA3n and SA4n) and the Blue Anchor Formation has predominantly reversed polarity (SA4r) except at its top, in the Williton Member. The Penarth Group and basal Lias Group have predominantly normal polarity (SA5 to SA6n) but short reversals occur within the Westbury Formation and at the base of the Lilstock Formation and the Lias Group (SA5r). This magnetostratigraphy is a good match with that found in the upper part of the Newark Supergroup succession in the eastern USA. The distinctive long reversal (SA4r) in the Blue Anchor Formation is equivalent to Newark Supergroup magnetozone interval E18r to E20r. Magnetozone SA5n, located mainly in the Penarth Group, probably equates with part of E22n and all of E23n in the Newark Supergroup. The reversed magnetozone, SA5r, at the base of the Lias Group, may correspond either with E23r in the Exeter Member (Passaic Formation) in the Newark Supergroup or with an undetected reverse polarity interval within the Newark Basin flood basalts. A change in the composition and diversity of terrestrial microfloras that occurs in the upper part of the Penarth Group at St. Audrie's Bay and elsewhere in the UK, is similar to that interpreted as marking the Triassic-Jurassic boundary in the Newark Supergroup. At St. Audrie's Bay, this change occurs c. 0.6 m below SA5r, within the Rhaetian, whereas in the Newark Supergroup, it occurs c. 20 m above the potentially equivalent E23r. Reconciliation of these disparities requires that either the microfloral changes are not synchronous between these locations or the change in the Newark Supergroup is time-equivalent with late Rhaetian conodont bearing strata. The correlation of marine and nonmarine Upper Triassic magnetostratigraphies is revaluated with the new data from St. Audrie's Bay, indicating the Twyning Mudstone and Blue Anchor formations are mid to late Alaunian (mid-Norian) in age. The Sevatian (late Norian) is represented by the Williton Member and the lower part of the Westbury Formation, but is incomplete because of disconformities at the base of the Williton Member and Penarth Group. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this paper, we present a dynamic diagenetic model of the oxygen consumption pathways and cycling of carbon, nitrogen, manganese, iron, and sulfur in marine sediments. Sixteen dissolved or solid species are included in our model and the vertical transport processes accounted for are molecular diffusion, bioturbation, irrigation, and burial. Adsorption of dissolved species onto solid sediment is assumed to be reversible and to follow a linear equilibrium isotherm. Interactions between species are formulated in 21 biogeochemical reactions that are regulated through simplified Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The key driving input parameter to the model is the transient flux of organic matter supplied to the sediment surface, below which mineralization is described through the well-known 3-G model that includes a fast, a slow, and a non-degradable pool of organic matter. The model was applied to the Arctic sediment of Young Sound in Northeast Greenland using extensive measurements covering a full annual cycle. The model parameterization was performed in a stepwise process, first focusing on parameters describing transport in the sediment and then on parameters related to biogeochemical reactions. The model successfully simulated the measured concentration-depth profiles of O2, {\{}Sigma{\}}CO2, NH4+, NO3-, Mn2+, Fe2+, adsorbed Fe2+, SO4+, H2S, FeS, FeS2, MnO2, FeOOH, and organic matter; sediment-water fluxes of {\{}Sigma{\}}CO2, O2, NH4+, and NO3-; depth-integrated process rates of denitrification and sulfate reduction; and depth profiles of iron-and sulfate reduction rates. The model application to the Young Sound sediment provided an excellent means to examine whether our perceptions of the most significant transport processes and biogeochemical reactions were correct. The successful simulation of measured data supported their internal consistency and confirmed previously reported interpretations and conclusions. The imposed supply of organic matter to the sediment surface that reproduced the measured data was found to be almost three times higher for the month of July than the average for the rest of the year. The peak in organic matter supply in mid-July coincided with the disappearance of sea ice. A sensitivity analysis performed for the model showed that the rate constants for the two degradable pools of organic matter were among those input variables that most affected the simulated results. As a result, we are confident of the accuracy of these rate constants of 76 y-1 and 0.095 y-1. In comparison with results from temperate sediments, these constants showed no significant correlation to the sub-zero Arctic temperatures. The reproduction of measured data for the sulfur cycle could be obtained only when sulfur disproportionation was included in the model as a sink for S0, indicating that this process plays an important role in the Young Sound sediment.},

abstract = {Abstract Sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (SO4-AOM) in marine sediments commonly leads to the precipitation of pyrite. It is, however, frequently challenging to unequivocally unravel the entire history of pyritization, because of the common coexistence of SO4-AOM derived pyrite with pyrite resulting from organiclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). To better understand how SO4-AOM affects pyritization in methane-bearing sediments and how this can be identified, we applied secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze the sulfur isotope composition ($\delta$34S) of authigenic pyrite in addition to sulfur isotope measurements of bulk sulfide and hand-picked pyrite aggregates from the two seafloor sites, HS148 and HS217, in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Authigenic, mostly tubular pyrite aggregates from these sites consist of three types of pyrite: framboids, zoned aggregates with radial overgrowths surrounding a framboidal core, and euhedral pyrite crystals. Framboids with low SIMS $\delta$34S values (as low as − 41.6‰ at HS148, and − 38.8‰ at HS217) are dispersed throughout the cores, but are especially abundant in the shallow part of the sedimentary column (i.e. above 483 cmbsf in HS148; above 670 cmbsf in HS217). These patterns are interpreted to reflect the dominance of OSR during early diagenetic processes in the shallow sediments. With increasing depth, both $\delta$34S values of bulk sulfide minerals and hand-picked pyrite aggregates increase sharply at 483 cmbsf in core HS148, and at 700 cmbsf in core HS217, respectively. Radial pyrite overgrowths and euhedral crystals become abundant at depth typified by high $\delta$34S values for hand-picked pyrite. Moreover, SIMS analysis reveals an extreme variability of $\delta$34S values for the three pyrite types on a small scale in these zones. Besides some moderately 34S enriched framboids, most of the overgrowths and euhedral crystals display extremely high SIMS $\delta$34S values (as high as + 114.8‰ at HS148, and + 74.3‰ at HS217), representing the heaviest stable sulfur isotope composition of pyrite ever reported to the best of our knowledge. Such an abrupt and extreme increase in $\delta$34Spyrite values with depth is best explained by an enrichment of 34S in the pool of dissolved sulfide caused by SO4-AOM in the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The increase in $\delta$34S values from framboidal cores to overgrowth layers and euhedral crystals indicates continuous, and finally near to complete exhaustion of dissolved sulfate at the SMTZ following a Rayleigh distillation process. SO4-AOM allowed for subsequent growth of later stage pyrite over the initial framboids, part of which formed earlier and at shallower depth by OSR. The combination of a detailed petrographic study of authigenic pyrite with SIMS analysis of stable sulfur isotopes in organic-rich strata proves to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the dynamics of sulfur cycling in modern and, potentially, ancient sedimentary sequences.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. Negative carbon and calcium isotope excursions, as well as climate shifts, took place during the most severe mass extinction event in Earth's history, the end-Permian (∼252 Ma). Investigating the connection between carbon and calcium cycles during transient carbon cycle perturbation events, such as the end-Permian, may help resolve the intricacies between the coupled calcium-carbon cycles, as well as provide a tool for constraining the causes of mass extinction. Here we identify the deficiencies of a simplified calcium model employed in several previous studies, and we demonstrate the importance of a fully coupled carbon cycle model when investigating the dynamics of carbon and calcium cycling. Simulations with a modified version of the Long-term Ocean-atmosphere-Sediment CArbon cycle Reservoir model, which includes a fully coupled carbon-calcium cycle, indicate that increased weathering rates and ocean acidification (potentially caused by Siberian Trap volcanism) are not capable of producing trends observed in the record, as previously claimed. Our model results suggest that combined effects of carbon input via Siberian Trap volcanism (12,000 Pg C), the cessation of biological carbon export, and variable calcium isotope fractionation (due to a change in the seawater carbonate ion concentration) represents a more plausible scenario. This scenario successfully reconciles $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 44 Ca trends observed in the sediment record, as well as the proposed warming of {\textgreater} 6°C.},

abstract = {A previously published hydrothermal brine-river water mixing model driven by ocean crust production suggests that the molar Mg/Ca ratio of seawater (mMg/Ca(sw)) has varied significantly (approximately 1.0-5.2) over Precambrian time, resulting in six intervals of aragonite-favouring seas (mMg/Ca(sw) {\textgreater} 2) and five intervals of calcite-favouring seas (mMg/Ca(sw) {\textless} 2) since the Late Archaean. To evaluate the viability of microbial carbonates as mineralogical proxy for Precambrian calcite-aragonite seas, calcifying microbial marine biofilms were cultured in experimental seawaters formulated over the range of Mg/Ca ratios believed to have characterized Precambrian seawater. Biofilms cultured in experimental aragonite seawater (mMg/Ca(sw) = 5.2) precipitated primarily aragonite with lesser amounts of high-Mg calcite (mMg/Ca(calcite) = 0.16), while biofilms cultured in experimental calcite seawater (mMg/Ca(sw) = 1.5) precipitated exclusively lower magnesian calcite (mMg/Ca(calcite) = 0.06). Furthermore, Mg/Ca(calcite )varied proportionally with Mg/Ca(sw). This nearly abiotic mineralogical response of the biofilm CaCO3 to altered Mg/Ca(sw) is consistent with the assertion that biofilm calcification proceeds more through the elevation of , via metabolic removal of CO2 and/or H+, than through the elevation of Ca2+, which would alter the Mg/Ca ratio of the biofilm's calcifying fluid causing its pattern of CaCO3 polymorph precipitation (aragonite vs. calcite; Mg-incorporation in calcite) to deviate from that of abiotic calcification. If previous assertions are correct that the physicochemical properties of Precambrian seawater were such that Mg/Ca(sw) was the primary variable influencing CaCO3 polymorph mineralogy, then the observed response of the biofilms' CaCO3 polymorph mineralogy to variations in Mg/Ca(sw), combined with the ubiquity of such microbial carbonates in Precambrian strata, suggests that the original polymorph mineralogy and Mg/Ca(calcite )of well-preserved microbial carbonates may be an archive of calcite-aragonite seas throughout Precambrian time. These results invite a systematic evaluation of microbial carbonate primary mineralogy to empirically constrain Precambrian seawater Mg/Ca.},

The gradients of such trends vary with environment of deposition. Although measurement error and compaction contribute to these regressions, they are primarily the consequence of unsteady, discontinuous sedimentation. The essential character of the unsteadiness may be cyclic or random, but net accumulation is characterized by fluctuations whose magnitudes increase with increasing recurrence interval. Ratios of median long- to short-term accumulation rates provide a measure of the expected completeness of sedimentary stratigraphic sections, at the time scale of the short-term rate.

The 4-day growth rate decreased under increasing ultraviolet (UV) radiation, with a ninefold greater response to WE relative to UVA. In vivo absorbance spectra showed that UVA and to a greater extent UVB caused a decrease in phycocyanin/chlorophyll a and an increase in carotenoids/chlorophyll a. The phycocyanin/chlorophyll a ratio was closely and positively correlated to the UVB-inhibited growth rate. Under fixed spectral gradients of UV radiation, the growth inhibition effect was dominated by UVB. However, at specific UVB irradiances the inhibition of growth depended on the ratio of UVB to UVA, and growth rates increased linearly with increasing WA. These results are consistent with the view that WE inhibition represents the balance between damage and repair processes that are each controlled by separate wavebands. They also underscore the need to consider UV spectral balance in laboratory and field assays of UVB toxicity.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic boundary interval in shallow shelf seas of South China shows Upper Permian limestones overlain by lowermost Triassic microbialites. Global sea-level rose across the Permian-Triassic boundary, but an irregular top-Permian erosion surface across a 10km north-south transect of the Great Bank of Guizhou contains evidence of sea-level fluctuation. The surface represents the 'event horizon' of mass extinction, below the biostratigraphic Permian-Triassic boundary defined by first appearance datum of conodont Hindeodus parvus. An Upper Permian foraminiferal grainstone beneath this surface contains geopetal sediments, etched grains, and pendent and meniscus cements interpreted here as vadose. However, these latter diagenetic processes occurred before the event horizon and were followed by erosion of the final Permian surface. This erosion cuts previous fabrics but lacks evidence of weathering or bioerosion. A few centimetres below is an earlier grainstone that was also eroded but lacks proof of sub-aerial processes. Samples therefore reveal one, or possibly two, small-scale relative sea-level changes before the Triassic transgression in this area, and these may relate to local tectonics. The final Permian surface is subject to at least four interpretations: (i) sub-aerial physical erosion and dissolution by carbon dioxide-enriched fresh water or carbon dioxide-enriched mixed water, prior to Triassic transgression; (ii) sub-aerial physical erosion overprinted by dissolution related to carbon dioxide-enriched sea water in the Early Triassic transgression; (iii) submarine dissolution affected by acidified sea water due to rapid increase in volcanically-derived carbon dioxide and oxidized methane released from marine clathrates; (iv) submarine dissolution due to acid anoxic waters rising across the continental shelf, unrelated to atmospheric carbon dioxide or oxidized methane. Field and petrographic evidence suggests that (i) is the simplest option; and it is possible that (ii) and (iii) occurred, but none are proved. Option (iv) is unlikely given the evidence and modelling of supersaturation of upwelled waters with respect to bicarbonate. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.

abstract = {The severe mass extinction of marine and terrestrial organisms at the end of the Permian Period (c. 251 Ma) was accompanied by a rapid ({\textless} 100 000 years and possibly {\textless} 10 000 years) negative excursion of c. 3 parts per thousand in the delta(13)C of the global surface oceans and atmosphere that persisted for some 500 000 years into the Early Triassic. Simulations with an ocean-atmosphere/carbon-cycle model suggest that the isotope excursion can be explained by collapse of ocean primary productivity, and changes in the delivery and cycling of carbon in the oceans and on land. Model results suggest that severe reduction of marine productivity led to an increase in surface-ocean dissolved inorganic carbon and a rapid, short-term increase in atmospheric pCO(2) (from a Late Permian base of 850 ppm to c. 2500 ppm). Increase in surface ocean alkalinity may have stimulated the widespread microbial and abiotic shallow-water carbonate deposition seen in the earliest Triassic. The model is also consistent with a long-term ({\textgreater} 1 Ma) decrease in sedimentary burial of organic carbon in the early Triassic.},

abstract = {The 400 km long transect through Ellesmere Island is located perpendicular to the North American continental margin between the Arctic Ocean in the NNW and the Greenland–Canadian Shield in the SSE. It provides an insight into the structural architecture and tectonic history of the upper parts of the continental crust. The northernmost segment of the transect is dominated by the composite Pearya Terrane, which amalgamated with the Laurentian margin during the Late Devonian–Early Carboniferous Ellesmerian Orogeny. The Neoproterozoic to Devonian Franklinian Basin is exposed south of the terrane boundary and most probably overlies the crystalline basement of the Greenland–Canadian Shield. The structures along the transect in this area are dominated by kilometre-scale Ellesmerian folding of the Franklinian Basin deposits above a deep-seated detachment, which is suggested to be located at the boundary between the basement of the Canadian Shield and the overlying {\textgreater}8 km thick Franklinian Basin. Following the development of the Late Mississippian–Palaeogene Sverdrup Basin, the complex Eurekan deformation reactivated Ellesmerian thrust faults and probably parts of the associated deep-seated detachment. In addition, large Eurekan strike-slip faults affected and displaced pre-Eocene deposits and tectonic structures, particularly in the northern part of the transect.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic extinction event is considered to be the most devastating environmental crisis of the Phanerozoic. With many coinciding factors involved, the role of marine anoxia during the extinction is still poorly understood. In this study a boreal Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) section from Svalbard, Norway has been investigated with the aim of better understanding the timing and nature of local marine anoxia onset and extinction events across the PTB. The section comprises the Kapp Starostin and Vikingh{\o}gda formations; $\delta$13Corg values indicate the PTB is located within the lower part of the Vikingh{\o}gda Formation. Lag deposits at the top of the Kapp Starostin Formation indicate a marine hiatus and ensuing transgression during the Late Permian shortly before the extinction event, implying concurrence of major ecological changes and sea-level rise. Pyrite framboid size distributions and total organic carbon (TOC) were used to evaluate bottom water oxygen conditions, and show that changes in bottom water redox conditions and extinction are clearly linked. Oxic to dysoxic bottom water conditions prevailed during deposition of Kapp Starostin Formation sediments and changed to anoxic to euxinic conditions above the formation boundary. The onset of anoxia is not abrupt but rather shows a gradual increase within the Kapp Starostin Formation during the Late Permian. The tipping point where bottom waters reach a long-term state of anoxia to euxinia coincides with the final extinction event, though changes in biotic assemblages at the top of the Kapp Starostin Formation indicate a marine ecosystem crisis prior to this. Oxygen depletion in the boreal region, as seen in our study section and correlating to Greenland and Arctic Canada, seems to be consistently more severe than in lower latitude settings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Chemical reactions in marine sediments and the resulting fluxes across the sediment-water interface influence the global carbon cycle and the pH of the sea and affect the abundance of CaCO3 and opal-forming plankton in the ocean. On very long timescales these diagenetic reactions control carbon burial in sedimentary rocks and the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Sedimentary deposits that remain after diagenesis are the geochemical artifacts used for interpreting past changes in ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycles, and climate. This chapter is about the processes of diagenesis and burial of the chemical elements that make up the bulk of the particulate matter that reaches the seafloor (organic matter, CaCO3, SiO2, Fe, Mn, and aluminosilicates).Understanding of sediment diagenesis and benthic fluxes has evolved with advances in both experimental methods and modeling. Measurements of chemical concentrations in sediments, their associated pore waters and fluxes at the sediment-water interface have been used to identify the most important reactions. Because transport in pore waters is usually by molecular diffusion, this medium is conducive to interpretation by models of heterogeneous chemical equilibrium and kinetics. Large chemical changes and manageable transport mechanisms have led to elegant models of sediment diagenesis and great advances in understanding of diagenetic processes.We shall see, though, that the environment does not yield totally to simple models of chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics, and laboratory determined constants often cannot explain the field observations. For example, organic matter degradation rate constants determined from modeling are so variable that there are essentially no constraints on these values from laboratory experiments. In addition, reaction rates of CaCO3 and opal dissolution determined from modeling pore waters usually cannot be reproduced in laboratory experiments of these reactions. The inability to mechanistically understand reaction kinetics calculated from diagenesis models is an important uncertainty in the field today.Processes believed to be most important in controlling the preservation of organic matter have evolved from a focus on the lability of the substrate to the protective mechanisms of mineral-organic matter interactions. The specific electron acceptor is not particularly important during very early diagenesis, but the importance of oxygen to the degradation of organic matter during later stages of diagenesis has been clarified by the study of diagenesis in turbidites deposited on the ocean floor during glacial periods.Evolution of thinking about the importance of reactions between seawater and detrital clay minerals has come full circle since the mid-1960s. "Reverse weathering" reactions were hypothesized in very early chemical equilibrium (Sillen, 1961) and mass-balance ( Mackenzie and Garrels, 1966) models of the oceans. Subsequent observations that marine clay minerals generally resemble those weathered from adjacent land and the discovery of hydrothermal circulation put these ideas on the back burner. Recent studies of silicate and aluminum diagenesis, however, have rekindled awareness of this process, and it is back in the minds of geochemists as a potentially important process for closing the marine mass balance of some elements.},

abstract = {Carbonate carbon-isotope values from the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary section at Seis/Siusi (Southern Alps, Italy) show a trend similar to that in numerous other P-T boundary sections worldwide. Values decrease from 3.2 ‰ (V-PDB) in the upper Bellerophon Limestone Formation (Late Permian) to a minimum of -1.7 ‰ in the lower Mazzin Member. This minimum may represent the P-T boundary. The overall declining carbon-isotope trend is interrupted by a ca. 1 ‰ positive excursion in the higher Tesero Oolite Horizon. This positive peak is located at a higher lithostratigraphic level than a comparable peak in the adjacent Pufels section, which suggests that the Tesero Oolite Horizon in the Seis section is stratigraphically slightly older than in the Pufels section, and this is also suggested by palaeomagnetic correlation. It is therefore concluded that the base of the Tesero Oolite Horizon does not reflect a synchronous "current event" but is slightly diachronous, a result that was previously shown by biostratigraphic correlation. Nevertheless, this suggestion should be verified by further detailed litho-, magneto- and chemostratigraphic analysis of other P-T sections in the Southern Alps. {\textcopyright} 2009 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

abstract = {Learn How to Use Growth Curve Analysis with Your Time Course Data   An increasingly prominent statistical tool in the behavioral sciences, multilevel regression offers a statistical framework for analyzing longitudinal or time course data. It also provides a way to quantify and analyze individual differences, such as developmental and neuropsychological, in the context of a model of the overall group effects. To harness the practical aspects of this useful tool, behavioral science researchers need a concise, accessible resource that explains how to implement these analysis methods. Growth Curve Analysis and Visualization Using R provides a practical, easy-to-understand guide to carrying out multilevel regression/growth curve analysis (GCA) of time course or longitudinal data in the behavioral sciences, particularly cognitive science, cognitive neuroscience, and psychology. With a minimum of statistical theory and technical jargon, the author focuses on the concrete issue of applying GCA to behavioral science data and individual differences.   The book begins with discussing problems encountered when analyzing time course data, how to visualize time course data using the ggplot2 package, and how to format data for GCA and plotting. It then presents a conceptual overview of GCA and the core analysis syntax using the lme4 package and demonstrates how to plot model fits. The book describes how to deal with change over time that is not linear, how to structure random effects, how GCA and regression use categorical predictors, and how to conduct multiple simultaneous comparisons among different levels of a factor. It also compares the advantages and disadvantages of approaches to implementing logistic and quasi-logistic GCA and discusses how to use GCA to analyze individual differences as both fixed and random effects. The final chapter presents the code for all of the key examples along with samples demonstrating how to report GCA results.  Throughout the book, R code illustrates how to implement the analyses and generate the graphs. Each chapter ends with exercises to test your understanding. The example datasets, code for solutions to the exercises, and supplemental code and examples are available on the author's website.},

A limited set of samples deemed representative yielded stable low-inclination paleomagnetic components carried essentially by hematite of chemical origin isolated in massive, fine-grained, and homogeneous ferricrete facies. These laterites originated at equatorial paleolatitudes characterized by intense weathering processes under warm and humid climatic conditions. Paleomagnetic estimates of paleolatitude from Iran, Karakoram, and north Tibet from this study and the literature, albeit sparse, provide testable constraints on the motion of the Cimmerian terranes as the result of the opening of the Neo-Tethys Ocean along the eastern margin of Gondwana during the Permian. We confirm and help refine previous suggestions that the Cimmerian terranes migrated from southern Gondwanan paleolatitudes in the Early Permian to subequatorial paleolatitudes by the Middle Permian - Early Triassic. As a novel conclusion, we find that timing, rates, and geometry of Cimmerian tectonics are broadly compatible with the transformation of Pangea from an Irvingian B to a Wegenerian A-type configuration with Neo-Tethyan opening taking place contemporaneously essentially in the Permian.},

abstract = {A numerical model of sulfate reduction and isotopic fractionation has been applied to pore fluid SO42− and $\delta$34S data from four sites drilled during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 168 in the Cascadia Basin at 48°N, where basement temperatures reach up to 62°C. There is a source of sulfate both at the top and the bottom of the sediment column due to the presence of basement fluid flow, which promotes bacterial sulfate reduction below the sulfate minimum zone at elevated temperatures. Pore fluid $\delta$34S data show the highest values (135 ‰) yet found in the marine environment. The bacterial sulfur isotopic fractionation factor, $\alpha$, is severely underestimated if the pore fluids of anoxic marine sediments are assumed to be closed systems and Rayleigh fractionation plots yield erroneous values for $\alpha$ by as much as 15‰ in diffusive and advective pore fluid regimes. Model results are consistent with $\alpha$ = 1.077 ± 0.007 with no temperature effect over the range 1.8 to 62°C and no effect of sulfate reduction rate over the range 2 to 10 pmol cm−3 d−1. The reason for this large isotopic fractionation is unknown, but one difference with previous studies is the very low sulfate reduction rates recorded, about two orders of magnitude lower than literature values that are in the range of $\mu$mol cm−3 d−1 to tens of nmol cm−3 d−1. In general, the greatest 34S depletions are associated with the lowest sulfate reduction rates and vice versa, and it is possible that such extreme fractionation is a characteristic of open systems with low sulfate reduction rates.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analyses of carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb) and total organic carbon (TOC; $\delta$13Corg), together with geochemical analyses of 54 major, minor, and trace elements and magnetic susceptibility measurements were carried out on whole rock samples of the undisturbed Permian–Triassic (P/Tr) limestone boundary sequence in the Idrijca Valley (W. Slovenia). At the P/Tr boundary, there is a 0.8-cm thick clayey marl layer (PTB) showing a characteristic magnetic susceptibility pulse and considerable enrichment in most major, minor, and trace elements. The P/Tr transition is characterized by (1) an abrupt decrease in sedimentation rate from 32 to 5 cm/100 ka, (2) a well known prominent negative excursion of $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg, reflecting global perturbations in the carbon cycle, and (3) the drastic disappearance of typically Upper Permian marine fauna. Although the shape of the $\delta$13Ccarb curve indicates gradual long-term change across the P/Tr boundary, the sharp negative $\delta$13Corg anomaly within an interval from 30 cm below to 6 cm above the boundary suggests an interruption of those gradual processes. Our observations for selected redox sensitive elements (Mo, U, V and Zn), abundances for organic carbon and sulphur and the rare earth elements (REE) distribution in the boundary sequence, as well as the shape of the Ce/Ce* curve suggest that oceanic anoxia was typical of the Upper Permian, and that the transition to oxygenated conditions occurred at the P/Tr boundary. Oxygenation at the P/Tr transition is coincidental with the terminal phase of the Upper Permian marine regression. The shape of the Ce/Ce* curve indicates that the redox environmental conditions changed again in the earliest Triassic, resulting once more in oxygen deficient conditions.},

abstract = {Authigenic carbonates are intercalated with massive gas hydrates in sediments of the Cascadia margin. The deposits were recovered from the uppermost 50 cm of sediments on the southern summit of the Hydrate Ridge during the RV Sonne cruise SO110. Two carbonate lithologies that differ in chemistry, mineralogy, and fabric make up these deposits. Microcrystalline high-magnesium calcite (14 to 19 mol.{\%} MgCO 3 ) and aragonite are present in both semiconsolidated sediments and carbonate-cemented clasts. Aragonite occurs also as a pure phase without sediment impurities. It is formed by precipitation in cavities as botryoidal and isopachous aggregates within pure white, massive gas hydrate. Variations in oxygen isotope values of the carbonates reflect the mineralogical composition and define two end members: a Mg-calcite with $\delta$ 18 O = 4.86‰ PDB and an aragonite with $\delta$ 18 O = 3.68‰ PDB. On the basis of the ambient bottom-water temperature and accepted equations for oxygen isotope fractionation, we show that the aragonite phase formed in equilibrium with its pore-water environment, and that the Mg-calcite appears to have precipitated from pore fluids enriched in 18 O. Oxygen isotope enrichment probably originates from hydrate water released during gas-hydrate destabilization.},

abstract = {Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is linked to the development of a variety of malignancies, including EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC). In this study, EBVaGC was detected in 15 (7.3{\%}) of 206 GC cases. To identify the EBV genomic variation, EBV genomic sequences isolated from 9 EBVaGC biopsy specimens were successfully retrieved, designated EBVaGC1 to EBVaGC9. By comparative analysis of these strains with another 6 completely sequenced EBV strains, EBV-wild type, B95-8, AG876, GD1, GD2, and HKNPC1, it was demonstrated that EBVaGC1 to 9 were most closely related to the GD1 strain. Phylogenetic analysis of the GC biopsy specimen-derived EBV (GC-EBV) genomes was subsequently performed to assess their genomic diversity and it exhibited the greatest divergence from the type 2 strain, AG876. Compared with the reference EBV strain GD1, they harbored 961 variations in total, including 919 substitutions, 23 insertions, and 19 deletions. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density varied substantially across all known open reading frames and was highest in latency-associated genes. Moreover, we identified 2 interstrain recombinants at the EBNA1 locus, which provided a further mechanism for the generation of diversity. Some T-cell epitope sequences in EBNA1 and LMP2A genes showed extensive variation across strains, which implied their importance in the development of vaccines and T-cell therapy. In conclusion, we reported the first genome-wide view of sequence variation of EBV isolated from primary EBVaGC biopsy specimens, which might serve as an effective method for further understanding the genomic variations contribute to EBVaGC carcinogenesis and treatment.},

abstract = {An asteroid impact at the end of the Cretaceous caused mass extinction, but extinction mechanisms are not well-understood. The collapse of sea surface to sea floor carbon isotope gradients has been interpreted as reflecting a global collapse of primary productivity (Strangelove Ocean) or export productivity (Living Ocean), which caused mass extinction higher in the marine food chain. Phytoplankton-dependent benthic foraminifera on the deep-sea floor, however, did not suffer significant extinction, suggesting that export productivity persisted at a level sufficient to support their populations. We compare benthic foraminiferal records with benthic and bulk stable carbon isotope records from the Pacific, Southeast Atlantic, and Southern Oceans. We conclude that end-Cretaceous decrease in export productivity was moderate, regional, and insufficient to explain marine mass extinction. A transient episode of surface ocean acidification may have been the main cause of extinction of calcifying plankton and ammonites, and recovery of productivity may have been as fast in the oceans as on land.},

These show that the onset of volcanism was marked by both large phreatomagmatic eruptions and extinctions amongst fusulinacean foraminifers and calcareous algae. The temporal coincidence of these two phenomena supports the idea of a cause-and-effect relationship. The crisis predates the onset of a major negative carbon isotope excursion that points to subsequent severe disturbance of the ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle.},

abstract = {The elemental composition of phytoplankton is a fusion of the evolutionary history of the host and plastid, resulting in differences in genetic constraints and selection pressures associated with environmental conditions. The evolutionary inheritance hypothesis predicts similarities in elemental composition within related taxonomic lineages of phytoplankton. To test this hypothesis, we measured the elemental composition (C, N, P, S, K, Mg, Ca, Sr, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cd and Mo) of 14 phytoplankton species and combined these with published data from 15 more species from both marine and freshwater environments grown under nutrient-replete conditions. The largest differences in the elemental profiles of the species distinguish between the prokaryotic Cyanophyta and primary endosymbiotic events that resulted in the green and red plastid lineages. Smaller differences in trace element stoichiometry within the red and green plastid lineages are consistent with changes in trace elemental stoichiometry owing to the processes associated with secondary endosymbioses and inheritance by descent with modification.},

abstract = {A marine Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) section at Nhi Tao, Vietnam, contains a series of at least 9 pyritic horizons characterized by concurrent decreases in pyrite S-(delta S-34(py)) and carbonate C-isotopic compositions (delta C-13(carb)). The first and largest of the events that precipitated these pyritic horizons was coincident with the Late Permian mass extinction, while subsequent events were generally smaller and occurred at quasiperiodic intervals of similar to 20 to 30 ka. A near complete lack of organic carbon to drive bacterial sulfate reduction in sediment pore waters, among other considerations, argues against a diagenetic control for these relationships. Rather, the covariant patterns documented herein are most easily explained as the product of recurrent upwelling of anoxic deep-ocean waters containing S-34- depleted hydrogen sulfide and C-13-depleted dissolved inorganic carbon. The sulfide delta S-34 record of the study section represents a mixture of a small amount of isotopically heavy authigenic pyrite (formed via in situ bacterial sulfate reduction) with a generally larger quantity of isotopically light syngenetic pyrite precipitated within the water column during upwelling episodes. Although upwelling of toxic deepwaters has been invoked in earlier studies as a mechanism for the Late Permian marine mass extinction, this is the first study to (1) document patterns of pyrite-delta C-13(carb) covariation that strongly support upwelling as a major process at the PTB and (2) provide evidence of multiple, quasiperiodic upwelling events that may reflect reinvigoration of global-ocean overturn following a prolonged interval of Late Permian deep-ocean stagnation.},

abstract = {We present a detailed curve of seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 for the Middle Permian to Triassic based on analyses of conodonts from overlapping sections in the U.S.A, and Pakistan, correlated using conodont biostratigraphy. The isotope ratio decreased in the Middle Permian at an average rate of 0.000062 Ma(-1), reached a minimum in the Capitanian (257-258 Ma), and increased in the Late Permian at an average rate of 0.000097 Ma(-1). The Late Permian rate of increase was roughly two and a half times greater than the average increase over the past 40 Ma, and approximately equal to the highest Cenozoic rates, which occurred over much shorter time intervals. Modeling results suggest that decreasing Middle Permian Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios were driven by changes in the riverine Sr flux to the oceans, while increasing ratios in the Late Permian/Triassic are attributed to both increased riverine Sr-87/Sr-86 and flux. The reduced Middle Permian riverine flux coincides with extreme continental aridity associated with the formation of Pangea and recorded by massive evaporite deposits. In addition, mountains in the equatorial region of Pangea may have created a rain shadow, thereby minimizing precipitation in regions that currently contribute the bulk of chemical weathering products to the ocean. Increasing riverine Sr-87/Sr-86 in the Late Permian is suggested by the observation that Nd-143/Nd-144 values decrease at the same time; however, the source of radiogenic Sr is not known. Frequently cited mechanisms for increasing Sr-87/Sr-86 in runoff, such as glaciations and continent-to-continent collisions, coincide instead with decreasing seawater Sr-87/Sr-86 in the Middle Permian. One possible source may have been deep erosion into older orogens, associated with a dramatic increase in chemical weathering in the Late Permian. The cause of enhanced weathering appears to have been increased levels of atmospheric CO2 with associated global warming and increased humidity. Proposed sources of CO2 include dissociation of gas hydrates and oxidation of organic matter during extreme sea level regression, as well as volcanic emissions from Siberian Traps eruptions. Continental floral and faunal distributions are consistent with this interpretation, as are oceanic delta(13)C patterns and variations in shallow-water sediment lithologies.},

abstract = {In the euxinic waters of the NW' Black Sea shelf, tower-like carbonate build-ups up to several metres in height grow at sites of cold methane seepage. These structures are part of an unique microbial ecosystem that shows a considerable biodiversity and a remarkable degree of organization. The accretion of the build-ups is promoted by the growth of centimetre-sized, methane-filled spheres constructed by calcifying microbial mats. Progressive mineralization of these spheres involves the early precipitation of strongly luminescent high-Mg-calcite rich in iron sulphides, and closely interfingered aragonite phases that finally create the stable (mega-) thrombolithic fabric of the towers. Within the microbial mats, microorganisms occur in distinctive spatial arrangements. Major players among the microbial consortia are the archaea groups ANME-1 and ANME-2, Crenarchaeota, and sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) of the Desulfosaricina/Desulfobacterium group. The intracellular precipitation of iron sulphides (greigite) by some of these bacteria, growing in close association with ANME-2, suggests iron cycling as an additional biogeochemical pathway involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM).},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Life on Earth has existed for at least 3.5 billion years. Yet, relatively little is known of its evolution during the first two billion years, due to the scarceness and generally poor preservation of fossilized biological material. Cyanobacteria, formerly known as blue green algae were among the first crown Eubacteria to evolve and for more than 2.5 billion years they have strongly influenced Earth's biosphere. Being the only organism where oxygenic photosynthesis has originated, they have oxygenated Earth's atmosphere and hydrosphere, triggered the evolution of plants --being ancestral to chloroplasts-- and enabled the evolution of complex life based on aerobic respiration. Having such a strong impact on early life, one might expect that the evolutionary success of this group may also have triggered further biosphere changes during early Earth history. However, very little is known about the early evolution of this phylum and ongoing debates about cyanobacterial fossils, biomarkers and molecular clock analyses highlight the difficulties in this field of research. Although phylogenomic analyses have provided promising glimpses into the early evolution of cyanobacteria, estimated divergence ages are often very uncertain, because of vague and insufficient tree-calibrations. Results of molecular clock analyses are intrinsically tied to these prior calibration points, hence improving calibrations will enable more precise divergence time estimations. Here we provide a review of previously described Precambrian microfossils, biomarkers and geochemical markers that inform upon the early evolution of cyanobacteria. Future research in micropalaeontology will require novel analyses and imaging techniques to improve taxonomic affiliation of many Precambrian microfossils. Consequently, a better understanding of early cyanobacterial evolution will not only allow for a more specific calibration of cyanobacterial and eubacterial phylogenies, but also provide new dates for the tree of life.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Biotic changes in nannofossils and radiolarians associated with the Valanginian d13C anomaly are documented at Ocean Drilling Program Hole 1149B in the Pacific Ocean: they are coeval and similar to those previously documented in the Tethys, suggesting a global perturbation of marine ecosystems. A marked increase in abundance of Diazomatolithus, absence of nannoconids, and a Pantanellium peak characterize the Valanginian d13C excursion. Such changes are interpreted as being due to global enhanced fertility and a biocalcification crisis under conditions of excess CO2. The occurrence of organic C–rich black shales in the Southern Alps and in the Pacific in the interval corresponding to the d13C excursion suggests a Valanginian oceanic anoxic event (OAE). Volcanism of the Parana`-Etendeka large igneous province (ca. 132 Ma) was presumably responsible for an increase of CO2, triggering a climate change and accelerated hydrological cycling, possibly causing an indirect fertilization of the oceans. Widespread nutrification via introduction of biolimiting metals at spreading ridges could have significantly increased during the Gondwana breakup and simultaneous tectonic events in three separate oceans. There is no paleontological or d18O evidence of warming during the Valanginian OAE. On the contrary, both nannofossils and oxygen isotopes record a cooling event at the climax of the d13C excursion. Weathering of basalts and burial of organic C–rich black shales were presumably responsible for CO2 drawdown and establishment of reversed greenhouse conditions},

abstract = {A diagenetic model is used to simulate the diagenesis and burial of particulate organic carbon (Corg) and phosphorus (P) in marine sediments underlying anoxic versus oxic bottom waters. The latter are physically mixed by animals moving through the surface sediment (bioturbation) and ventilated by burrowing, tube-dwelling organisms (bioirrigation). The model is constrained using an empirical database including burial ratios of Corg with respect to organic P (Corg:Porg) and total reactive P (Corg:Preac), burial efficiencies of Corg and Porg, and inorganic carbon-to-phosphorus regeneration ratios. If Porg is preferentially mineralized relative to Corg during aerobic respiration, as many previous studies suggest, then the simulated Porg pool is found to be completely depleted. A modified model that incorporates the redox-dependent microbial synthesis of polyphosphates and Porg (termed the microbial P pump) allows preferential mineralization of the bulk Porg pool relative to Corg during both aerobic and anaerobic respiration and is consistent with the database. Results with this model show that P burial is strongly enhanced in sediments hosting fauna. Animals mix highly labile Porg away from the aerobic sediment layers where mineralization rates are highest, thereby mitigating diffusive PO43- fluxes to the bottom water. They also expand the redox niche where microbial P uptake occurs. The model was applied to a hypothetical shelf setting in the early Paleozoic; a time of the first radiation of benthic fauna. Results show that even shallow bioturbation at that time may have had a significant impact on P burial. Our model provides support for a recent study that proposed that faunal radiation in ocean sediments led to enhanced P burial and, possibly, a stabilization of atmospheric O2 levels. The results also help to explain Corg:Porg ratios in the geological record and the persistence of Porg in ancient marine sediments.},

abstract = {Understanding the end-Triassic mass extinction event (201.36 Ma) requires a clear insight into the stratigraphy of boundary sections, which allows for long-distance correlations and correct distinction of the sequence of events. However, even after the ratification of a Global Stratotype Section and Point, global correlations of TJB successions are hampered by the fact that many of the traditionally used fossil groups were severely affected by the crisis. Here, a new correlation of key TJB successions in Europe, U.S.A. and Peru, based on a combination of biotic (palynology and ammonites), geochemical ($\delta$13Corg) and radiometric (U/Pb ages) constraints, is presented. This new correlation has an impact on the causality and temporal development during the end-Triassic event. It challenges the hitherto used standard correlation, which has formed the basis for a hypothesis that the extinction was caused by more or less instantaneous release of large quantities of light carbon (methane) to the atmosphere, with catastrophic global warming as a consequence. The new correlation instead advocates a more prolonged scenario with a series of feedback mechanisms, as it indicates that the bulk of the hitherto dated, high-titanium, quartz normalized volcanism of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) preceded or was contemporaneous to the onset of the mass extinction. In addition, the maximum phase of the mass extinction, which affected both the terrestrial and marine ecosystems, was associated with a major regression and repeated, enhanced earthquake activity in Europe. A subsequent transgression resulted in the formation of hiati or condensed successions in many areas in Europe. Later phases of volcanic activity of the CAMP, producing low titanium, quartz normalized and high-iron, quartz normalized basaltic rocks, continued close to the first occurrence of Jurassic ammonites and the defined TJB. During this time the terrestrial ecosystem had begun to recover, but the marine ecosystem remained disturbed.},

abstract = {0 0 M o n t h 2 0 1 7 | V o L 0 0 0 | n A t U R E | 1 The rise of oxygen on the early Earth (about 2.4 billion years ago) 1 caused a reorganization of marine nutrient cycles 2,3 , including that of nitrogen, which is important for controlling global primary productivity. However, current geochemical records 4 lack the temporal resolution to address the nature and timing of the biogeochemical response to oxygenation directly. Here we couple records of ocean redox chemistry with nitrogen isotope (15 N/ 14 N) values from approximately 2.31-billion-year-old shales 5 of the Rooihoogte and Timeball Hill formations in South Africa, deposited during the early stages of the first rise in atmospheric oxygen on the Earth (the Great Oxidation Event) 6 . Our data fill a gap of about 400 million years in the temporal 15 N/ 14 N record 4 and provide evidence for the emergence of a pervasive aerobic marine nitrogen cycle. The interpretation of our nitrogen isotope data in the context of iron speciation and carbon isotope data suggests biogeochemical cycling across a dynamic redox boundary, with primary productivity fuelled by chemoautotrophic production and a nitrogen cycle dominated by nitrogen loss processes using newly available marine oxidants. This chemostratigraphic trend constrains the onset of widespread nitrate availability associated with ocean oxygenation. The rise of marine nitrate could have allowed for the rapid diversification and proliferation of nitrate-using cyanobacteria and, potentially, eukaryotic phytoplankton. Nitrogen (N) is an essential element for all living organisms, required alongside carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) for the formation of nucleic acids and proteins. As a result, N and P are the principal limiting nutri-ents controlling autotrophic CO 2 fixation, which in turn regulates climate, weathering, and the redox state of Earth's surface on geologic timescales. The marine nitrogen cycle is driven largely by biological processes. The primary source of N to the biosphere is nitrogen fixation, the conversion of atmospheric N 2 to organic nitrogen in its bioavailable form (ammonium, NH 4 +). In the modern oceans, ammonium is oxi-dized via the stepwise process of nitrification, producing nitrite (NO 2 −) and nitrate (NO 3 −). Nitrate (and nitrite) can be assimilated into organic matter, by both oxygenic photoautotrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic phytoplankton. Fixed nitrogen is mostly recycled in the water column, but some sinks to the sediments where it is buried and/ or remineralized. Some bioavailable nitrogen in the modern oceans is returned to the atmosphere as N 2 via denitrification (the reduction of nitrate) and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox, the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite) in oxygen-minimum zones 7},

abstract = {Understanding a planet's atmosphere is a necessary condition for understanding not only the planet itself, but also its formation, structure, evolution, and habitability. This requirement puts a premium on obtaining spectra and developing credible interpretative tools with which to retrieve vital planetary information. However, for exoplanets, these twin goals are far from being realized. In this paper, I provide a personal perspective on exoplanet theory and remote sensing via photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy. Although not a review in any sense, this paper highlights the limitations in our knowledge of compositions, thermal profiles, and the effects of stellar irradiation, focusing on, but not restricted to, transiting giant planets. I suggest that the true function of the recent past of exoplanet atmospheric research has been not to constrain planet properties for all time, but to train a new generation of scientists who, by rapid trial and error, are fast establishing a solid future foundation for a robust science of exoplanets.},

abstract = {The 87Sr/86Sr ratios and Sr concentrations in sediment and pore fluids are used to evaluate the rates of calcite recrystallization at ODP Site 807A on the Ontong Java Plateau, an 800-meter thick section of carbonate ooze and chalk. A numerical model is used to evaluate the pore fluid chemistry and Sr isotopes in an accumulating section. The deduced calcite recrystallization rate is 2{\%} per million years ({\%}/Myr) near the top of the section and decreases systematically in older parts of the section such that the rate is close to 0.1/age (in years). The deduced recrystallization rates have important implications for the interpretation of Ca and Mg concentration profiles in the pore fluids. The effect of calcite recrystallization on pore fluid chemistry is described by the reaction length, L, which varies by element, and depends on the concentration in pore fluid and solid. When L is small compared to the thickness of the sedimentary section, the pore fluid concentration is controlled by equilibrium or steady-state exchange with the solid phase, except within a distance L of the sediment-water interface. When L is large relative to the thickness of sediment, the pore fluid concentration is mostly controlled by the boundary conditions and diffusion. The values of L for Ca, Sr, and Mg are of order 15, 150, and 1500 meters, respectively. LSr is derived from isotopic data and modeling, and allows us to infer the values of LCa and LMg. The small value for LCa indicates that pore fluid Ca concentrations, which gradually increase down section, must be equilibrium values that are maintained by solution-precipitation exchange with calcite and do not reflect Ca sources within or below the sediment column. The pore fluid Ca measurements and measured alkalinity allow us to calculate the in situ pH in the pore fluids, which decreases from 7.6 near the sediment-water interface to 7.1 ?? 0.1 at 400-800 mbsf. While the calculated pH values are in agreement with some of the values measured during ODP Leg 130, most of the measurements are artifacts. The large value for LMg indicates that the pore fluid Mg concentrations at 807A are not controlled by calcite-fluid equilibrium but instead are determined by the changing Mg concentration of seawater during deposition, modified by aqueous diffusion in the pore fluids. We use the pore fluid Mg concentration profile at Site 807A to retrieve a global record for seawater Mg over the past 35 Myr, which shows that seawater Mg has increased rapidly over the past 10 Myr, rather than gradually over the past 60 Myr. This observation suggests that the Cenozoic rise in seawater Mg is controlled by continental weathering inputs rather than by exchange with oceanic crust. The relationship determined between reaction rate and age in silicates and carbonates is strikingly similar, which suggests that reaction affinity is not the primary determinant of silicate dissolution rates in nature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

                        66Zn signal showed two periodicities of 35.2 and 21.2 ka. We suggest that the latter is caused by the precession of the Earth's axis of rotation. The periodogram exhibits a minimum at 41.1 ka, thus showing that the Zn isotopic composition is independent of the obliquity in the eastern equatorial Pacific. The range of $\delta$
                        66Zn values observed for the carbonate fraction of ODP 849 overlaps with the range observed for Fe-Mn nodules in the world's oceans, which suggests that seawater/carbonate Zn isotope fractionation is weak. We therefore assume that most of the Zn isotope variability is a result of the selective entrainment of the light isotopes by organic matter in the surface ocean. The ODP 849 $\delta$
                        66Zn record seems to follow the changes in the insolation cycles. Changes in the late summer/fall equatorial insolation modulate the intensity of the equatorial upwelling, hence the mixing between deep and surface waters. We propose that during decreased summer/fall equatorial insolation, when a steep thermocline can develop (El Ni{\~{n}}o-like conditions), the surface waters cannot be replenished by deep waters and become depleted in the lighter Zn isotopes by biological activity, thus resulting in the progressive increase of the $\delta$

abstract = {A single carbonate coquinoid lens from the Griesbachian (Early Triassic) of Shanggan, South China, yielded 11 bivalve species described in this study in addition to four gastropod and one ammonoid species reported elsewhere. This makes the Shanggan fauna one of the richest mollusc faunas from the early post-extinction interval after the end-Permian mass extinction event. Four of the present genera are long-term survivors, five are holdovers that went extinct at the end of the Griesbachian or later in the Early Triassic, and seven first appear in the Griesbachian. Three new bivalve species are described: Myalinella newelli nov. sp., Scythentolium scutigerulus nov. sp., and Eumorphotis shajingengi nov. sp. The genus Astartella, previously assumed to have vanished at the end of the Permian, is reported for the first time from the Early Triassic, which also removes Astartidae from Early Triassic Lazarus taxa. The small growth size of the Astartella specimens supports an earlier hypothesis that many of the Early Triassic Lazarus taxa did not survive in unknown refuges but were simply overlooked due to the scarcity of easily observable large-sized specimens. Ecologically, a comparatively high proportion of infaunal bivalve species (4/11) is remarkable for the early post-extinction interval, supporting the impression of a relatively advanced recovery state. Moreover, abundance-data of the bivalve-gastropod community reveal a remarkably low dominance index (D=0.17) that is suggestive for advanced recovery and stable environmental conditions. It is proposed that the Shanggan fauna represents a late Griesbachian benthic recovery event that coincided with the appearance of similarly diverse benthic faunas in Oman and Primorye. A high proportion of genera that have previously not been reported from the Early Triassic indicate that the prevalence of poor preservation conditions is a major obstacle in identifying early phases of recovery from the greatest crisis in the history of metazoan life. The early recovery of benthic faunas reported in this study questions previous claims of a prolonged lag phase as a consequence of the extraordinary extinction magnitude or the persistence of adverse environmental conditions.

In order to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Devonian, the oxygen isotope composition of apatite phosphate was measured on 639 conodont samples from sequences in Europe, North America and Australia. The Early Devonian (Lochkovian; 416–411 Myr) was characterized by warm tropical temperatures of around 30 °C. A cooling trend started in the Pragian (410 Myr) with intermediate temperatures around 23 to 25 °C reconstructed for the Middle Devonian (397–385 Myr). During the Frasnian (383–375 Myr), temperatures increased again with temperatures to 30 °C calculated for the Frasnian–Famennian transition (375 Myr). During the Famennian (375–359 Myr), surface water temperatures slightly decreased. Reconstructed Devonian palaeotemperatures do not support earlier views suggesting the Middle Devonian was a supergreenhouse interval, an interpretation based partly on the development of extensive tropical coral–stromatoporoid communities during the Middle Devonian. Instead, the Devonian palaeotemperature record suggests that Middle Devonian coral–stromatoporoid reefs flourished during cooler time intervals whereas microbial reefs dominated during the warm to very warm Early and Late Devonian.},

abstract = {Chemical and isotopic studies of Jurassic carbonate concretions indicate an origin by anaerobic methane oxidation. Concretion growth occurred within the top 1 m of sediment in a thin zone where methane was consumed to stimulate a late, rejuvenated phase of sulfate reduction. Similar chemical and isotopic characteristics are shown by diagenetic carbonates in several limestone-shale sequences, and an origin by anaerobic methane oxidation is proposed for these sequences also. The evolution of isolated concretions into diagenetic limestones depends on the extent of, and depth variations in, carbonate supersaturation arising from anaerobic methane oxidation and the persistence of a reduced sedimentation rate or a depositional hiatus. Diagenetic limestones formed in this way can often be recognized by their association with a later pyrite phase that is more abundant and has more positive 34S values than the adjacent shales.},

abstract = {An Early Jurassic, Late Pliensbachian section (margaritatus to spinatum ammonite Zone) northeast of Cremlingen, Germany, revealed three horizons with abundant glendonites, calcite pseudomorphs after ikaite (CaCO3{\textperiodcentered}6H2O), as well as authigenic carbonates. These pseudomorphs have previously been used as indicators for organic- and phosphate-rich paleoenvironments with near-freezing bottom water temperatures. Stable isotope measurements clearly show that the ikaite/glendonite was precipitated at a methane seep location with methanotrophic sulfate reduction as the triggering geochemical process for ikaite formation at the sulfate-methane interface. The termination of methane seepage probably led to the disintegration of the primary mineral ikaite and successive pseudomorph formation. Reconstructed paleo bottom water temperatures (ca. 10°C) from belemnites and ostracods indicate temperatures well above the previously observed range of ikaite stability (near freezing), raising the question if methane seeps are distinct geochemical sites promoting ikaite formation at higher temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study attempts to characterise the chemical weathering of basalts and to quantify the flux of carbon transferred from the atmosphere to the ocean during this major process at the surface of the Earth. To this aim, we have compiled different published chemical compositions of small rivers draining basalts. Basaltic river waters are characterised by relatively high Na-normalized molar ratios (Ca/Na: 0.2-3.9; HCO3/Na: 1-10; Mg/Na: 0.15-6) in comparison with those usually observed for river draining silicates. The data also show the climatic influence on basalt weathering and associated CO2 consumption. Runoff and temperature are the main parameters controlling the chemical weathering rate and derived CO2 consumption during basaltic weathering. From these relationships and digital maps, we are able to define the contribution of basalts to the global silicate flux. Taking account of this result, we estimate that the CO2 flux consumed by chemical weathering of basalts is about 4.08×1012 mol/year. The fluxes from the islands of Indonesia and regions of central America represent around 40{\%} of this flux. The global flux of CO2 consumed by chemical weathering of basalts represents between 30{\%} and 35{\%} of the flux derived from continental silicate determined by Gaillardet et al. [Chem. Geol. 159 (1999) 3]. Finally, it appears that volcanic activity not only acts as a major atmospheric CO2 source, but also creates strong CO2 sinks that cannot be neglected to better understand the geochemical and climatic evolution of the Earth. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We reconstructed changes in both pCO(2) and temperature over an episode of transient global warming called the Middle Eocene Climatic Optimum (MECO; {\~{}}40 million years ago). Organic molecular paleothermometry indicates a warming of southwest Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) by 3° to 6°C.

abstract = {The modern shallow-platform, calcium-carbonate–dominated sediments of the Florida Keys (Florida Bay and Atlantic reef tract) are diverse in their biological, sedimentological, and geochemical properties. Sites of intense bioturbation and thick seagrass cover are pervasive within Florida Bay and are often characterized by appreciable early diagenetic aragonite dissolution. Additional, less common sites show atypical diagenetic profiles that suggest strong reworking and/or very rapid deposition of the upper sediment layer extending to a depth of at least 20 cm. Diagenesis in these seagrass-free areas is dominated by rapid burial of labile organic matter that would otherwise be degraded aerobically under conditions of slower burial. Correspondingly, these oozy, water-rich sediments display anomalously high rates of microbial decomposition as recorded in 35S-sulfate reduction rates and patterns of sulfate depletion, high dissolved sulfide concentrations in excess of several millimolar (mM), and elevated alkalinities. Unlike many sites in Florida Bay where solute concentrations suggest volumetrically significant net dissolution of metastable carbonate phases, dramatic increases in carbonate alkalinity from organic matter oxidation during bacterial sulfate reduction support net precipitation of CaCO3 in the highly reactive surface layer. This early carbonate mineralization is indicated by measured depletions in Ca approaching 4 mM relative to overlying seawater. Geochemical signatures of sediment reworking or rapid sedimentation are corroborated by porosity trends; visual evaluations, including X-radiography; and an interval of essentially constant 210Pb activity. Rapid burial within the reactive layer gives rise to restricted-system diagenetic behavior that is recorded in the sulfur isotope compositions of dissolved sulfate and sulfide. Nevertheless, despite strong 34S enrichments in the pore-water sulfate and clear evidence for diagenetic calcium carbonate precipitation, carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS) trapped within the muds (at concentrations from ∼2400 to 4200 ppm) preserves the original 34S/32S ratio of the overlying seawater. Such preservation of the $\delta$34S of seawater sulfate in bulk lime mud samples—even in the presence of appreciable diagenetic overprinting—confirms the broad utility of the CAS approach in reconstructing ancient ocean chemistry.},

abstract = {The biochronological characterization of the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) is here improved by means of conodont unitary associations zones (UAZs). The selected data set comprises the six best documented sections in South China, including the Meishan global stratotype section and point of the PTB. This new biochronological zonation has a much higher accuracy than previous schemes, which were based on continuous interval zones. We show how traditional interval zones around the PTB in South China suffer from diachronous boundaries that cross each other as the result of sampling effort (intensity and density) and of geographical or ecological exclusion of zonal index taxa, inclusive of the first occurrence of the base Triassic index species Hindeodus parvus. Our quantitative and robust approach produces a discrete sequence comprising six UAZs. In the closest agreement with the position of the PTB in Meishan, the PTB falls here in the interval of separation between UAZ2 and UAZ3. In Meishan, this interval of separation corresponds to the stratigraphic interval above bed 25 and below bed 27, which also includes the formational boundary between the Changhsing and the Yinkeng formations. We provide a new and independent support for this placement by showing that it correlates with the main turnover of conodont species within the analysed time interval. As previously documented, the main extinction interval ranged from bed 25 to bed 28 in Meishan, which are here assigned to UAZ2 and to UAZ4, respectively. Therefore, the main extinction episode is not of end-Permian age but straddles the PTB. Previous claims for two distinct extinction pulses bracketing the PTB in South China were based on traditional conodont interval zones and are not supported by the new UA zonation. The oldest Triassic UAZ3 is identified by the characteristic species Hindeodus pisai and by any of the ten characteristic pairs of species Neogondolella zhejiangensis or Neogondolella tulongensis associated with Hindeodus changxingensis, Hindeodus parvus, Neogondolella planata, Neogondolella taylorae or Isarcicella huckriedei. Separate analyses of anchignathodontids and neogondolellids sub-data sets show that the base of the Triassic is unambiguously defined by the occurrences of the characteristic species H. changxingensis, Isarcicella prisca, and I. huckriedei in shallow-water settings, and of two characteristic species, N. planata and N. taylorae, in deep-water settings. Moreover, we document uncoupled diversity trends across the PTB for each of these two clades. A substantial diversification phase of anchignathodontids spans the interval from UAZ3 to UAZ5. It is followed by a drastic (50{\%}) reduction of the number of species between UAZ5 and UAZ6. On the other hand, neogondolellids show a protracted extinction from UAZ4 to UAZ6. In South China, correlations are proposed for the microbialite-bearing sections and deeper-water PTB sections. The UA method also highlights which parts of the conodont record are still insufficiently documented for reliable correlations. Biochronological correlations with Meishan and its U-Pb radio-isotopic ages allow inferring a maximal duration of 61 ± 48 ka for the gap at the base of the Triassic microbial limestone at Dajiang, a time interval that also corresponds to the duration of the main extinction episode in Meishan.},

abstract = {This investigation focuses on the original mineralogy of Wuchiapingian (Late Permian) to Induan (Early Triassic) strata of the Shahreza section of Iran to understand changes in marine carbonate system during this transition. Aragonitic carbonates precipitated during the early part of the Wuchiapingian, gradually changing to calcite during the middle part of the Wuchiapingian and continuing through the Changhsingian. Carbonate precipitation ceased during the latest Changhsingian at the end-Permian Event Horizon (EH). A sharp reversal back to aragonite precipitation occurred in the Early Triassic. These changes are interpreted as the ocean's response to a changing climate. This study proposes three types of seawater for the Late Permian to Early Triassic interval. Normal (Anahita-type) seawater during the Late Permian was hospitable to life and supported a highly active carbonate factory. Acidic (Jahi-type) seawater during the PTB transition was acidic and hostile to life, slowing or halting carbonate production. Alkaline (Amordad-type) seawater during the Early Triassic was life-nurturing and supported an active carbonate factory. It sustained life until a normal (Anahita-type) seawater could be re-established. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Microbialite masses within the lowest Triassic strata along the southern periphery of the tropical Yangtze Platform were produced in a post-Permian microbial regime. These microbialites (the Hindeodus parpus Zone), which are represented by thrombolites, occur only where terrigenous sediment influx was rare, even in shallow-marine-settings. The lower parts of the thrombolites lie upon a distinctly unconformable Permian-Triassic boundary and exhibit a thin-bedded to thick-bedded planar structure. In contrast, the upper parts of the thrombolites contain domed macrostructures that interact in complex ways with skeletal grainstones and packstones. Irregular frameworks of thrombolite bodies differ in degree of lateral and vertical accumulation and in the amalgamation of mesoclots of microbial origin; they exhibit marked variations in texture. A transgressive episode occurred in the earliest Triassic following the mass extinctions, and this included the initiation of microbial regimes that usually formed planar thrombolite masses in lower-energy, deep subtidal environments. The varied textures and structures of thrombolites during deposition may reflect a combination of sea-level fluctuations, physicochemical ocean conditions, microbial activity, skeletal-sediment influx, and other factors. These earliest Triassic, uniquely microbial regimes collapsed in stepwise fashion and were succeeded by the Isarcicella staeschei and I. isarcica zones, which contain a pre-dominance of mudstones, suggesting a marked sea-level transgression. Space-specific and time-specific, the earliest Triassic microbialites record short-term, high-resolution paleoenvironmental fluctuations immediately after the end-Permian extinctions.

abstract = {Quantifying the rates of biogeochemical processes in marine sediments is essential for understanding global element cycles and climate change. Because organic matter degradation is the engine behind benthic dynamics, deciphering the impact that various forces have on this process is central to determining the evolution of the Earth system. Therefore, recent developments in the quantitative modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are critically reviewed. The first part of the review synthesizes the main chemical, biological and physical factors that control organic matter degradation in sediments while the second part provides a general review of the mathematical formulations used to model these processes and the third part evaluates their application over different spatial and temporal scales. Key transport mechanisms in sedimentary environments are summarized and the mathematical formulation of the organic matter degradation rate law is described in detail. The roles of enzyme kinetics, bioenergetics, temperature and biomass growth in particular are highlighted. Alternative model approaches that quantify the degradation rate constant are also critically compared. In the third part of the review, the capability of different model approaches to extrapolate organic matter degradation rates over a broad range of temporal and spatial scales is assessed. In addition, the structure, functions and parameterization of more than 250 published models of organic matter degradation in marine sediments are analyzed. The large range of published model parameters illustrates the complex nature of organic matter dynamics, and, thus, the limited transferability of these parameters from one site to another. Compiled model parameters do not reveal a statistically significant correlation with single environmental characteristics such as water depth, deposition rate or organic matter flux. The lack of a generic framework that allows for model parameters to be constrained in data-poor areas seriously limits the quantification of organic matter degradation on a global scale. Therefore, we explore regional patterns that emerge from the compiled more than 250 organic matter rate constants and critically discuss them in their environmental context. This review provides an interdisciplinary view on organic matter degradation in marine sediments. It contributes to an improved understanding of global patterns in benthic organic matter degradation, and helps identify outstanding questions and future directions in the modeling of organic matter degradation in marine sediments. {\textcopyright} 2013 .},

abstract = {Measurements of bulk density, moisture retention, aggregate stability and shear strength were taken for sandy loam and loamy sand soils with different organic-matter contents ranging from 1.23 to 5.64{\%}. Organic matter in soils originated from either being under grass treatment for some years or mixing two forms of peat each at 4, 11 and 17{\%} rates to a control soil. Aggregate stability was measured by the percentage water stable aggregates (WSA) as well as individual aggregate energy (IAE) measured using single drop impact test. Organic matter from grass significantly increased percentage WSA from 2.15 to 21.62{\%} and IAE from 4 to 33 mJ. While percentage WSA reduced significantly from 2.50 to 0.88 with increasing peat content, the IAE reduced only slightly from 3.93 to 3.45 mJ. This suggests that peat reduces the overall soil stability without affecting the strength of individual aggregates. Organic matter from both grass and peat reduced bulk density and increased moisture retention. While organic matter from grass increased soil shear strength from 19.17 to 24.44 kN m-2, that from peat reduced it from 15.47 to 11.90 kN m-2. The effects of both forms of organic matter on bulk density and moisture retention were expected to have reduced their strengths. However, since organic matter from grass improved aggregate stability, it reduced soil dispersion in water and improved shear strength, while peat only made the soil aggregates fall apart and reduced their shear strengths. The results from this study show that the influence of organic matter on soil shear strength depends on whether or not it improves soil aggregate stability. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {In Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems nutrient-rich waters are transported to the ocean surface, fuelling high photoautotrophic primary production. Subsequent heterotrophic decomposition of the produced biomass increases the oxygen-depletion at intermediate water depths, which can result in the formation of oxygen minimum zones (OMZ). OMZs can sporadically accumulate hydrogen sulfide (H2S), which is toxic to most multicellular organisms and has been implicated in massive fish kills. During a cruise to the OMZ off Peru in January 2009 we found a sulfidic plume in continental shelf waters, covering an area {\textgreater}5500 km(2), which contained ∼2.2×10(4) tons of H2S. This was the first time that H2S was measured in the Peruvian OMZ and with ∼440 km(3) the largest plume ever reported for oceanic waters. We assessed the phylogenetic and functional diversity of the inhabiting microbial community by high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA, while its metabolic activity was determined with rate measurements of carbon fixation and nitrogen transformation processes. The waters were dominated by several distinct $\gamma$-, $\delta$- and $\epsilon$-proteobacterial taxa associated with either sulfur oxidation or sulfate reduction. Our results suggest that these chemolithoautotrophic bacteria utilized several oxidants (oxygen, nitrate, nitrite, nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) to detoxify the sulfidic waters well below the oxic surface. The chemolithoautotrophic activity at our sampling site led to high rates of dark carbon fixation. Assuming that these chemolithoautotrophic rates were maintained throughout the sulfidic waters, they could be representing as much as ∼30{\%} of the photoautotrophic carbon fixation. Postulated changes such as eutrophication and global warming, which lead to an expansion and intensification of OMZs, might also increase the frequency of sulfidic waters. We suggest that the chemolithoautotrophically fixed carbon may be involved in a negative feedback loop that could fuel further sulfate reduction and potentially stabilize the sulfidic OMZ waters.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of the basal sauropodomorph dinosaur Thecodontosaurus in the 1830s, the associated fauna from the Triassic fissures at Durdham Down (Bristol, UK) has not been investigated, largely because the quarries are built over. Other fissure sites around the Bristol Channel show that dinosaurs represented a minor part of the fauna of the Late Triassic archipelago. Here we present data on microvertebrates from the original Durdham Down fissure rocks, which considerably expand the taxonomic diversity of the island fauna, revealing that it was dominated by the sphenodontian Diphydontosaurus, and that archosauromorphs, including sphenosuchian crocodylomorphs, coelophysoid theropods, and the basal sauropodomorph Thecodontosaurus, were diverse. Importantly, a few fish teeth provide new information about the debated age of the fissure deposit, which is identified as lower Rhaetian. Thecodontosaurus had been assigned an age range over 20-25. Myr of the Late Triassic, so this narrower age determination (209.5-204. Myr) is important for studies of early dinosaurian evolution. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Geologists' Association.},

abstract = {Sea level rise is able to change the geochemical conditions in coastal systems. In these environments, transport of contaminants can be controlled by the stability and adsorption capacity of iron oxides. The behavior of adsorbed and co-precipitated arsenic in jarosite, schwertmannite, ferrihydrite, and goethite in sea water (common secondary minerals in coastal tailings) was investigated. The aim of the investigation was to establish As retention and transport under a marine flood scenario, which may occur due to climate change. Natural and synthetic minerals with co-precipitated and adsorbed As were contacted with seawater for 25 days. During this period As, Fe, Cl, SO 4 , and pH levels were constantly measured. The larger retention capability of samples with co-precipitated As, in relation with adsorbed As samples, reflects the different kinetics between diffusion, dissolution, and surface exchange processes. Ferrihydrite and schwertmannite showed good results in retaining arsenic, although schwertmannite holding capacity was enhanced due its buffering capacity, which prevented reductive dissolution throughout the experiment. Arsenic desorption from goethite could be understood in terms of ion exchange between oxides and electrolytes, due to the charge difference generated by a low point-of-zero-charge and the change in stability of surface complexes between synthesis conditions and natural media.},

abstract = {Iron transformations in a calcium carbonate rich fresh-water sediment were studied by analyzing the relevant constituents of both interstitial water and solid matter. Analysis of interstitial water shows that the observed redox sequence NO-3 NH+4, MnO2 Mn(II), FeOOH/Fe(II), SO2-4 S(-II) is roughly in agreement with that predicted by the Gibbs Free Energy for the corresponding reactions. In contrast to marine sediments, these redox transitions occur in the uppermost sediments, i.e., at depths of 0-4 cm. Deeper in the sedimentary sequence, the depth profile for dissolved iron exhibits a steady non-linear increase up to 400 $\mu$mol dm-3. In this anoxic zone, according to thermodynamic predictions, iron (II)-minerals such as iron sulfide, siderite, and vivianite should precipitate while Fe(III) oxides should be completely dissolved. However, microscopic analysis showed that Fe(III) oxides were present throughout the studied sediment. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis suggests the presence of iron sulfide could be verified but not that of siderite or vivianite. These observations indicate kinetic control of iron transformations. We have investigated the importance of kinetic control of iron distribution in anoxic sediments using a diagenetic model for dissolved iron(II). A rough estimate of time scales for dissolution and precipitation rates was made by imposing limiting boundary conditions. Using the calculated rate constant, we established that more than 1000 years would be required for the complete dissolution of Fe(III) oxides, which is agreement with our observations and experimental data from the literature. Calculated precipitation rates of Fe(II) for a given mineral phase such as siderite yield a maximum value of 3 $\mu$g(FeCO3) g-1(dry sediment) yr-1. Such low rates would explain the absence of siderite and vivianite. Finally, it can be inferred from the MnT FeT ratio in the sediments that this ratio depends on the redox conditions of the sediment-water interface at the time of deposition. Thus, this ratio can be used as "paleo-redox indicator" in lacustrine sediments. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

We report here detailed PGE analyses of two expanded sections from the late Permian northern and southern hemispheres that allow separate events to be distinguished and confirm a terrestrial source for the PGE. These sources are either contemporaneous seawater or older basaltic volcanics associated with the sections and the PGE were precipitated by a possible combination of development of anoxia in the oceans and post-depositional redistribution. The PGE content in sections at the Permo-Triassic boundary is the result of geochemical and lithological control on metal precipitation that is found in many other black shales throughout geological time.},

This deposit has been interpreted as microbial reef rock, digitate dendrolite, digital thrombolite, dendritic thrombolite, or bacterial deposits. Agreement has been reached in considering them as microbialites, but not in their formation. This study has revealed that the spotted and dendroid microbialites were composed of numerous fossil casts formed by the planktic cyanobacterium, Microcystis, a coccoid genus that at the present-day commonly forms blooms in modern lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. The abundance of the fossils and the diagenesis they experienced has determined the macroscopic fabric: where they abundant, the rock appears as dendroid, otherwise, it appears as spotted. The ancient Microcystis bloom might produce toxin to kill other metazoans, and be responsible for the oceanic anoxia that has puzzled so many researchers for so many years.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors. Explaining the ∼5-million-year delay in marine biotic recovery following the latest Permian mass extinction, the largest biotic crisis of the Phanerozoic, is a fundamental challenge for both geological and biological sciences. Ocean redox perturbations may have played a critical role in this delayed recovery. However, the lack of quantitative constraints on the details of Early Triassic oceanic anoxia (for example, time, duration, and extent) leaves the links between oceanic conditions and the delayed biotic recovery ambiguous. We report high-resolution U-isotope ($\delta$238U) data from carbonates of the uppermost Permian to lowermost Middle Triassic Zal section (Iran) to characterize the timing and global extent of ocean redox variation during the Early Triassic. Our $\delta$238U record reveals multiple negative shifts during the Early Triassic. Isotope mass-balance modeling suggests that the global area of anoxic seafloor expanded substantially in the Early Triassic, peaking during the latest Permian to mid-Griesbachian, the late Griesbachian to mid-Dienerian, the Smithian-Spathian transition, and the Early/Middle Triassic transition. Comparisons of the U-, C-, and Sr-isotope records with a modeled seawater PO43- concentration curve for the Early Triassic suggest that elevated marine productivity and enhanced oceanic stratification were likely the immediate causes of expanded oceanic anoxia. The patterns of redox variation documented by the U-isotope record show a good first-order correspondence to peaks in ammonoid extinctions during the Early Triassic. Our results indicate that multiple oscillations in oceanic anoxia modulated the recovery of marine ecosystems following the latest Permian mass extinction.},

abstract = {Dissolved gaseous Hg (DGM) in seawater and atmospheric gaseous Hg were measured at six sites in Minamata Bay to investigate mercury (Hg) evasion flux from the sea surface. Minamata Bay was severely polluted with mono-methyl Hg (MMHg). Total Hg and MMHg, seawater characteristics such as water temperature and salinity, and meteorological parameters were also observed to estimate the air-sea exchange of Hg. The mean concentration of DGM was 116±76pgL-1(N=75), ranging from 19 to 442pgL-1, and the concentrations were higher in summer than in other seasons. DGM concentration showed a significantly positive correlation with solar radiation, and air and water temperatures. Inversely, DGM showed a significantly negative correlation with salinity and redox potential (ORP). Hg evasion fluxes from the sea surface of the bay were calculated using a two-layer gas exchange model and ranged between 0.11 and 33ngm-2h-1(mean, 5.4±6.3ngm-2h-1). The estimated flux was slightly higher in the spring and fall when wind speed increased because the gas exchange coefficient used for estimating Hg evasion flux strongly depends on wind speed. The annual evasion flux of Hg from the sea surface of Minamata Bay was estimated to be 47±56$\mu$gm-2, which was on the same order of magnitude as the direct atmospheric deposition flux of Hg (24$\mu$gm-2) during the observation period. Therefore, Hg evasion from the sea surface likely plays an important role in the Hg cycle of Minamata Bay.},

abstract = {Bulk-carbonate carbon isotope measurements are a widely applied proxy for investigating the ancient biogeochemical carbon cycle. Temporal carbon isotope trends serve as a prime stratigraphic tool, with the inherent assumption that bulk micritic carbonate rock is a faithful geochemical recorder of the isotopic composition of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon. However, bulk-carbonate rock is also prone to incorporate diagenetic signals. The aim of the present study is to disentangle primary trends from diagenetic signals in carbon isotope records which traverse the Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic boundary in marine carbonate-bearing sequences of Iran and South China. By pooling newly produced and published carbon isotope data we confirm that a global first-order trend towards depleted values exists. However, a large amount of scatter is superimposed on this geochemical record. In addition, we observe a temporal trend in the amplitude of this residual {\&}delta;13C variability, which is reproducible for the two studied regions. We suggest that (sub)seafloor microbial communities and their control on calcite nucleation as well as on ambient porewater dissolved inorganic carbon-{\&}delta;13C pose a viable mechanism to induce bulk-rock {\&}delta;13C variability. Numerical model calculations highlight that early diagenetic carbonate rock stabilization, and linked carbon isotope alteration, can be controlled by organic matter supply and subsequent microbial remineralization. Low marine sulfate and a major biotic decline among late Permian bottom-dwelling organisms facilitated a spatial increase in heterogeneous organic carbon accumulation, causing varying degrees of carbon isotope overprint. A simulated time series suggests that a 50{\&}thinsp;{\%} increase in the spatial scatter of organic carbon relative to the average, in addition to an imposed increase in the likelihood of sampling cements formed by microbial calcite nucleation to one out of 10 samples, is sufficient to induce the observed signal of carbon isotope variability. These findings put constraints on the application of Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic carbon isotope chemostratigraphy based on whole-rock samples, which appears less refined than classical biozonation dating schemes. On the other hand, this signal of increased carbon isotope variability concurrent with the largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic may inform about local carbon cycling mediated by spatially heterogeneous (sub)-seafloor microbial communities under suppressed bioturbation.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Carbonate minerals such as dolomite, kutnahorite or rhodochrosite are frequently, but not exclusively generated by microbial processes. In recent anoxic sediments, Mn(II)carbonate minerals (e.g. rhodochrosite, kutnahorite) derive mainly from the reduction of Mn(IV) compounds by anaerobic respiration. The formation of huge manganese-rich (carbonate) deposits requires effective manganese redox cycling in an oxygenated atmosphere. However, putative anaerobic pathways such as microbial nitrate-dependent manganese oxidation, anoxygenic photosynthesis and oxidation in ultraviolet light may facilitate manganese cycling even in an early Archean environment, without the availability of oxygen. In addition, manganese carbonates precipitate by microbially induced processes without change of the oxidation state, e.g. by pH shift. Hence, there are several ways how these minerals could have been formed biogenically and deposited in Precambrian sediments. We will summarize microbially induced manganese carbonate deposition in the presence and absence of atmospheric oxygen and we will make some considerations about the biogenic deposition of manganese carbonates in early Archean settings.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The Earth and the oceans have warmed significantly over the past four decades, providing evidence that the Earth is undergoing long-term climate change. Increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns have been documented. Cyanobacteria have a long evolutionary history, with their first occurrence dating back at least 2.7 billion years ago. Cyanobacteria often dominated the oceans after past mass extinction events. They evolved under anoxic conditions and are well adapted to environmental stress including exposure to UV, high solar radiation and temperatures, scarce and abundant nutrients. These environmental conditions favor the dominance of cyanobacteria in many aquatic habitats, from freshwater to marine ecosystems. A few studies have examined the ecological consequences of global warming on cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton over the past decades in freshwater, estuarine, and marine environments, with varying results. The responses of cyanobacteria to changing environmental patterns associated with global climate change are important subjects for future research. Results of this research will have ecological and biogeochemical significance as well as management implications.},

abstract = {A possible global drop in marine carbon isotope values to as low as 12 Peedee belemnite (PDB), recorded in the Ediacaran Shuram Formation of Oman, has been attributed to the non-steady-state oxidation of oceanic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) resulting from the rise in atmospheric oxygen to near modern values at the end of the Precambrian. Geologic constraints indicate that the excursion lasted between 25 and 50 m.y., requiring a DOC pool thousands of times to 10,000 times the modern inventory to conform with carbon isotope mass balance calculations for a 12 excursion. At the consequent rates of DOC oxidation, oceanic sulfate and oxygen in the atmosphere and oceans are exhausted on a time scale of {\~{}}800 k.y. Oxidant depletion is incompatible with independent geochemical and biological indicators that show oceanic sulfate and oxygen levels were maintained or increased during the Shuram excursion. Furthermore, a DOC-driven excursion does not explain strong covariation between the carbon and oxygen isotope record. These indicators show that negative isotope excursions recorded in the Shuram and other Ediacaran sections are unlikely to represent a global ocean signal.},

These models include hydrogeological, geochemical and geomicrobiological interpretations that shed light on kinetic constraints on low-temperature dolomite formation, and, in particular, how certain microbes can overcome such limitations. In this review, we focus on the direct and indirect mechanisms by which microbes facilitate the nucleation and shallow burial diagenetic stabilization of dolomite in marine sediments. We also consider the likely effects of local and global scale biogeochemical perturbations over the distribution and activities of subsurface microbes, and, thus, potentially over the stratigraphic distribution of dolomite. Considering the many advances that have been made in the fields of geomicrobiology and biogeochemistry during the past 20 years, investigating the important role microbes play in sedimentary systems will undoubtedly contribute to a more complete interpretation of dolomite formation in the rock record.},

abstract = {The specific heat of alpha-FeOOH was measured in the temperature range 0.6 to 30 K by a combination of semi-adiabatic and isothermal techniques. A broad specific-heat anomaly was detected at approximately 1 K. The data above this anomaly were fitted to the equation C=B-asw T(3)e(-Delta/T)+Sigma B-n T-n, where Sigma B-n T-n represents the harmonic-lattice model for the lattice specific heat, and B-asw T(3)e(-Delta/T) represents the magnetic specific heat. The e (-Delta/T) term that modifies the usual T-3 term for an antiferromagnetic spin-wave contribution accounts for a spin-wave gap in the spin-wave spectrum, where Delta is the width of the spin-wave gap in Kelvin. As expected, the root-mean-square deviation (RMS) of the fit decreased progressively with inclusion of additional lattice terms, but the Debye temperature, Theta(D), and the spin-wave gap, Delta, remained essentially unchanged. The addition of a linear term, gammaT, decreased the RMS of the fit and eliminated the need for an excessive number of lattice terms. The gammaT contribution to the specific heat, rather than being electronic in nature, is associated either with a small number of Fe3+ vacancies, or with loosely bound particles vibrating in defect sites in the crystallite interfaces. The possibility of the existence of vacancies is implied by the excess water content in the sample (0.083 moles of H2O per mole of FeOOH) and the presence of the interfaces is indicated by the particle size (determined by BET surface area measurement) being larger than the individual crystallite size (determined by X-ray diffraction).},

abstract = {The end of the Permian was a time of crisis that culminated in the Earth's greatest mass extinction. There is much speculation as to the cause for this catastrophe. Here we provide a full suite of high-resolution and coeval geochemical results (trace and rare earth elements, carbon, oxygen, strontium and clumped isotopes) reflecting ambient seawater chemistry and water quality parameters leading up to the end‐Permian crisis. Preserved brachiopod low-Mg calcite-based seawater chemistry, supplemented by data from various localities, documents a sequence of interrelated primary events such as coeval flows of Siberian Trap continental flood basalts and emission of carbon dioxide leading to warm and extreme Greenhouse conditions with sea surface temperatures (SST) of {\~{}} 36 °C for the Late Permian. Although anoxia has been advanced as a cause for the mass extinction, most biotic and geochemical evidence suggest that it was briefly relevant during the early phase of the event and only in areas of upwelling, but not a general cause. Instead, we suggest that renewed and increased end‐Permian Siberian Trap volcanic activity, about 2000 years prior to the extinction event, released massive amounts of carbon dioxide and coupled with thermogenic methane emissions triggered extreme global warming and increased continental weathering. Eventually, these rapidly discharged greenhouse gas emissions, less than 1000 years before the event, ushered in a global Hothouse period leading to extreme tropical SSTs of {\~{}} 39 °C and higher. Based on these sea surface temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were about 1400 ppmv and 3000 ppmv for the Late and end‐Permian, respectively. Leading up to the mass extinction, there was a brief interruption of the global warming trend when SST dropped, concurrent with a slight, but significant recovery in biodiversity in the western Tethys. It is possible that emission of volcanic sulfate aerosols resulted in brief cooling just after the onset of intensified warming during the end of the Permian. After aerosol deposition, global warming resumed and the biotic decline proceeded, and was accompanied by suboxia, in places of the surface ocean which culminated in the greatest mass extinction in Earth history.},

abstract = {Celestine {\{}(SrSO4){\}} is a common minor diagenetic mineral phase in marine carbonate sediments, where it is thought to form during the transformation of Sr-bearing aragonite or biogenic calcite to {\{}low-Sr{\}} calcite or dolomite. The largest known sedimentary celestine occurrences, however, contain several million metric tons of {\{}SrSO4{\}} and cannot be as readily explained. These large deposits occur as epigenetic replacements and cavity-fill in coastal marine carbonate and evaporite sequences. Host rocks range in age from Silurian to Pliocene. There is variable evidence of associated hydrothermal activity, and the Sr typically has a radiogenic signature. One of the keys to explaining the origin of these massive celestine deposits is determining why celestine and not barite {\{}(BaSO4){\}}, which is orders of magnitude less soluble, is the replacement {\{}phase.Although{\}} precipitation of massive celestine beds during the early stages of evaporation of sea water has been invoked by some, this hypothesis is not supported by either experimental or field observations, which indicate most sea-water Sr is removed as dispersed sulfate phases during the halite stage of evaporation. The association of large celestine deposits with coastal marine carbonate-evaporite sequences more likely reflects in part the significant difference in the geochemical behavior of Sr and Ba during burial diagenesis. The concentration of Sr in subsurface sedimentary fluids is buffered by silicate-carbonate mineral assemblages, and the concentration of Sr increases significantly with increasing salinity. The concentration of Ba, in contrast, is controlled by equilibrium with barite and is inversely related to the concentration of dissolved sulfate. Basinal fluids having the highest {\{}Sr/Ba{\}} ratios, and thus those most likely to form celestine rather than barite, have high salinities and moderately high levels of sulfate. The precursors to such waters can be produced in coastal marine settings by the evaporation of sea water. As these brines reflux into underlying or laterally adjacent sediments, they can leach substantial amounts of Sr as they attempt to achieve chemical equilibrium with their host sediments. Barium concentrations are kept low by the presence of dissolved sulfate. If these diagenetically altered fluids are then discharged into beds containing calcium sulfate minerals and/or sulfate-rich waters, the precipitation of celestine would result. Porosity produced by uplift and karstification of associated carbonates would help focus fluid flow.},

abstract = {Brachiopods are the most widely used biological constituents for the determination of stable C- and O-isotopic compositions in Paleozoic sediments. In the present study, critical precautions for obtaining reliable isotope values and maximum possible reliability are discussed. Samples were taken in the tectonically undisturbed and exceptionally well-preserved Silurian sequence on Gotland (Sweden). The state of preservation of brachiopod shells was examined by cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy and by comparison of shell ultrastructures with those of recent brachiopods. Nine types of ultrastructure are distinguished and attributed either to biological differences or to diagenetic alterations. For isotope analyses, only largely unaltered areas of the secondary, fibrous shell layer should be used. Shell layers with other types of ultrastructure (primary, tertiary, laminar) may have isotopic compositions different from the assumed seawater value even when diagenetically unaltered. Only brachiopod taxa with a shell succession that includes a sufficiently thick secondary shell layer (e.g., Spiriferida, Rhynchonellida, Orthida) give reliable, mutually corresponding isotope values, indicating that the shell calcite precipitated at or near equilibrium with ambient seawater. Brachiopods with other kinds of shell successions (Strophomenida, Pentamerida) as well as other calcite-shelled organisms (trilobites, ostracodes) give non-equilibrium isotopic results and therefore should not be used. By restricting the samples to one species or to a group of closely related species, even minor differences in primary isotopic composition can be excluded. In the Silurian of Gotland, the stratigraphically widely distributed spiriferid Atrypa reticularis was selected for study. Considering the type of record, four different taphonomic assemblages are defined. In autochthonous assemblages of specimens, which lived contemporarily, original values of carbon as well as oxygen isotopes can be evaluated with a reliability of {\textless} ± 0.4‰. This allows the recognition of minor, hydrographically produced differences between neighbouring, contemporary facies areas and the determination of small ({\textless} 1‰) isotopic excursions. Thus, besides being indicators of hydrographic conditions in ancient oceans, stable carbon- and oxygen-isotope compositions can be used as a stratigraphic tool that provides correlations, sometimes even within biozones. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

A horizon within the upper Lindstrom Formation (datum A) is characterized by increased Fe-oxyhydroxide fluxes and weathering intensity as well as modest shifts toward more reducing water-mass conditions and higher marine productivity, recording an initial disturbance that washed soils into the marine environment. The contact between chert of the Lindstrom Formation and silty shale of the overlying Blind Fiord Formation, which is 1.6 m higher and ∼50 k.y. younger than datum A, records a large increase in detrital sediment flux, more strongly enhanced marine productivity, and a regional extinction of siliceous sponges, herein termed the "Arctic extinction event.". The horizon equiv. to the latest Permian mass extinction of Tethyan shallow-marine sections is 5.6 m higher and ∼100 k.y. younger than the Arctic extinction event, demonstrating the diachronous nature of the marine biotic and environmental crisis at a global scale; it is assocd. with intensified anoxia and possible changes in phytoplankton community compn. in the study section. Marine environmental deterioration in the Sverdrup Basin, probably triggered by terrestrial ecosystem deterioration and elevated detrital sediment fluxes, was under way by the early part of the late Changhsingian, well before the onset of main-stage Siberian Traps flood basalt volcanism. The event sequence at West Blind Fiord may record the deleterious effects of early-stage explosive silicic eruptions that affected the Boreal region, possibly through deposition of toxic gas and ash within a restricted latitudinal band, while having little impact on marine ecosystems in the peri-equatorial Tethyan region.

We examined a detailed geochemical record of the Festningen section, Spitsbergen. A stepwise extinction is noted as: starting with (1) loss of carbonate shelly macrofauna, followed by (2) loss of siliceous sponges in conjunction with an abrupt change in ichnofabrics as well as dramatic change in the terrestrial environment, and (3) final loss of all trace fossils. We interpret loss of carbonate producers as related to shoaling of the lysocline in higher latitudes, in relationship to building atmospheric CO2. The loss of siliceous sponges is coincident with the global LPE event and is related to onset of high loading rates of toxic metals (Hg, As, Co) that we suggest are derived from Siberian Trap eruptions. The final extinction stage is coincident with redox-sensitive trace metal and other proxy data that suggest onset of anoxia after the other extinction events. These results show a remarkable record of progressive environmental deterioration in northwestern Pangea during the extinction crises.},

We observe a sulphur isotope signal (negative $\delta$(34)S with negative $\Delta$(33)S) that may have resulted from limitation of sulphate supply, which may be linked to a near shutdown of bioturbation during shoaling of anoxic water. These results indicate that episodic shoaling of anoxic water may have contributed to the profound biodiversity crisis before the final catastrophe.

At the five stations, Hoeglundina elegans, Cibicidoides pachydermus, Uvigerina peregrina, Uvigerina mediterranea preferentially occupy shallow infaunal niches, whereas Melonis barleeanus and Uvigerina elongatastriata occupy an intermediate infaunal microhabitat, and Globobulimina spp. live in a deep infaunal niche close to the zero oxygen boundary. When compared with ??18O values of calcite formed in equilibrium with bottom waters, U. peregrina forms its test in close equilibrium with bottom water ??18O. All other foraminiferal taxa calcify with a constant offset to calculated equilibrium calcite. There is no systematic relationship between the foraminiferal microhabitat depth and the ????18O between foraminiferal and equilibrium calcite. We calculated correcting factors for the various taxa, which are needed for constructing multispecies-based oxygen isotope records in paleoceanographic studies of the study area. The ??13C values of foraminiferal taxa investigated in this study do neither record bottom water ??13CDIC in a 1: 1 relationship nor with a constant offset, but appear to be mainly controlled by microhabitat effects. The increase of ??13C values of shallow infaunal taxa with increasing water depth reflects the decrease of the exported flux of organic carbon along the bathymetric transect and early diagenetic processes in the surface sediment. This is particularly the case for the shallow infaunal U. peregrina. The ??13C values of deep infaunal Globobulimina spp. are much less dependent on the exported organic matter flux. We suggest that the ????13C between U. peregrina and Globobulimina spp. can shed light on the various pathways of past degradation of organic detritus in the benthic environments. At a station in 550 m water depth, where periodic eutrophication of sediment surface niches was demonstrated previously, we performed a two-year seasonal survey of the isotopic composition of foraminiferal faunas. No marked seasonal changes of the stable carbon isotopic composition of shallow, intermediate and deep infaunal foraminiferal taxa were observed. Thus, the ??13C values of foraminiferal individuals belonging to the {\textgreater} 150 ??m fraction may result from rather long-term calcification processes lasting for several weeks or months, which limit the impact of ephemeral 12C enrichment of shallow infaunal niches on the isotope chemistry of adult individuals during eutrophic periods. Only highly opportunistic taxa reproducing or calcifying during phytoplankton bloom periods and the subsequent deposits of phytoplankton remains in the benthic environment may exhibit a particularly low ??13C, indicative of such short productive periods. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Significantly different Guadalupian-Late Triassic patterns are observed in the evolution of attached and isolated carbonate platforms of the southwestern Tethys (Oman Mountains). Close to the rim of the attached Arabian platform, carbonates of the Saiq and Mahil Formations reveal an almost complete Permian-Triassic sedimentary record. Guadalupian-Changhsingian 3rd order sequences consist of fossiliferous transgressive systems tracts and monotonous highstand systems tracts with mud/wackestone and coral bafflestone. The youngest Changhsingian beds are bioturbated floatstone with crinoids, sponges and bryozoans. All sediments indicate a healthy, tropical carbonate production. Above, a unique facies change begins with a pyrite-encrusted omission surface. Greenish mudstone rich in authigenic pyrite infills the relief of the unconformity and is overlain by clastic sediment and by laminated, microbialite-bearing carbonate. Unfossiliferous sediments and seafloor cements indicate a change in carbonate production towards abiotic processes. Prevailing anoxic conditions were interrupted by seven oxic event beds, as indicated either by low-diversity and small-sized ichnotaxa or by shell beds with low-diversity bivalve and crinoid assemblages. By comparison with published data, the described sedimentary sequence can be assigned to the Changhsingian-earliest Griesbachian. Beginning probably with the Anisian, bioturbated Griesbachian-Dienerian recovery period and the unconformity below to the latest grain-supported sediment textures mark the return to biogenic tropical carbonate production under oxic conditions. The Middle-Late Triassic carbonate platform consists of stacked high-frequency shallowing upward cycles. By contrast, carbonate production of Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms was discontinuous and interrupted by a large gap. Guadalupian deposits of the Al Jil Formation consist of bioclastic limestone typical of a tropical carbonate production. The uppermost bed, an impoverished bioclastic packstone capped by an unconformity, marks the onset of platform drowning which resulted from the end-Guadalupian mass extinction. Above, a polymict breccia witnessed rift pulses of the Neo-Tethys. The overlying pelagic mud- and packstone contains radiolarians and rare foraminifera of Lopingian age, and overlying microbialites. In the Carnian, tropical shallow-water carbonate production restarted with a low-relief platform and culminated in a Norian-Rhaetian reef-rimmed platform. Stacked Lofer cycles dominated the inner platform of Jebel Kawr (Misfah Formation). We here propose a differential onset and severity of the Late Permian mass extinctions for carbonate platforms. On the Arabian Plate, tropical carbonate production collapsed after the end-Lopingian mass extinction and was replaced by microbialites and sea-floor cements during the earliest Triassic. After approximately six million years, tropical shallow-water carbonate production resumed in the Middle Triassic. Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms drowned shortly after the end-Guadalupian mass extinction and did not recover before the Late Triassic. Absence of shallow-water limestone suggests that carbonate production of isolated platforms ceased for about 30 million years, a period exceeding the recovery of most marine ecosystems.

Comparative physiology links paleontological and palcoenvironmental observations, supporting the hypothesis that an end-Permian trigger, most likely Siberian Trap volcanism, touched off a set of physically-l inked perturbations that acted synergistically to disrupt the metabolisms of latest Permian organisms. Global wan-ning, anoxia, and toxic sulfide probably all contributed to end-Permian mass mortality, but hypercapnia (physiological effects of elevated P-CO2) best accounts for the selective survival of marine invertebrates. Paleophysiological perspectives further suggest that persistent or recurring hypercapnia/global warmth also played a principal role in delayed Triassic recovery. More generally, physiology provides an important way of paleobiological knowing in the age of Earth system science. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The extent to which this covariation reflects a geologically controlled sampling bias remains unknown. We show that Phanerozoic records of seawater chemistry and continental flooding contain information on the diversity of marine animals that is independent of sedimentary rock quantity and sampling. Interrelationships among variables suggest long-term interactions among continental flooding, sulfur and carbon cycling, and macroevolution. Thus, mutual responses to interacting Earth systems, not sampling biases, explain much of the observed covariation between Phanerozoic patterns of sedimentation and fossil biodiversity. Linkages between biodiversity and environmental records likely reflect complex biotic responses to changing ocean redox conditions and long-term sea-level fluctuations driven by plate tectonics.},

@article{Mapes2009,
abstract = {Faunal analysis of an oxygen-depleted marine Lower Carboniferous succession (Late Mississippian Ruddle Shale) suggests how some cephalopod taxa laid their eggs during the Late Palaeozoic. At the Ruddle Shale collecting site in Arkansas, USA, the facies and overall fauna suggest severe oxygen depletion at the sediment/water interface. The Ammonoidea, with their small egg size, were probably laid in suspended gelatinous eggfilled masses in the water column above the bottom or by attachment of the egg masses to floating debris. The ammonitella embryos developed within the suspended or attached egg mass; hatched individuals became part of the free-swimming plankton biota. Based on shell morphology the Bactritoidea probably followed the same reproductive pattern. Coiled nautiloids (the Nautilida) and most orthoconic nautiloids (mostly the Pseudorthocerida) probably did not lay their eggs in the mid water column or as floatant attachments. This conclusion is based on the fact that, with one exception, all shells recovered of these two nautiloid orders are well past hatching. Gastropods in the Ruddle Shale are very small and cannot be visually detected in the field. However, microgastropods are abundant in washed residues. Most specimens are much smaller than 1 mm. The largest caenogastropod specimen is 1.3 mm high. These caenogastropods represent isolated larval shells and a successful metamorphosis was impossible because of oxygen depletion on the bottom. Allegations that a size of more than 1 mm is too large for pelagic larvae are refuted by examples of planktotrophic larval shells of modern gastropods (more than 1 mm high) and Triassic caenogastropods (up to 2 mm high) from the Cassian Formation (Northern Italy, South Alps). Repository information is given for the type-material of the gastropod species Nuetzelina striata Bandel, 2002 and Anozyga arkansasensis Bandel, 2002 which were both erected based on specimens from the Ruddle Shale that were illustrated by N{\"{u}}tzel {\&} Mapes in 2001. {\textcopyright} Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2009 The Lethaia Foundation.},

abstract = {The Karoo Basin of South Africa was one of several contemporaneous intracratonic basins in southwestern Gondwana that became active in the Permo-Carboniferous (280 Ma) and continued to accumulate sediments until the earliest Jurassic, 100 million years later. At their maximum areal extent, during the early Permian, these basins covered some 4.5 million km2. The present outcrop area of Karoo rocks in southern Africa is about 300 000 km2 with a maximum thickness of some 8000 m. The economic importance of these sediments lies in the vast reserves of coal within the Ecca Group rocks of northern and eastern Transvaal and Natal, South Africa. Large reserves of sandstone-hosted uranium and molybdenum have been proven within the Beaufort Group rocks of the southern Karoo trough, although they are not mineable in the present market conditions. Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the major stratigraphic units of the Karoo succession in South Africa demonstrates the changes in depositional style caused by regional and localized tectonism within the basin. These depocentres were influenced by a progressive aridification of climate which was primarily caused by the northward drift of southwestern Gondwana out of a polar climate and accentuated by the meteoric drying effect of the surrounding land masses. Changing palaeoenvironments clearly influenced the rate and direction of vertebrate evolution in southern Gondwana as evidenced by the numerous reptile fossils, including dinosaurs, which are found in the Karoo strata of South Africa, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe. During the Late Carboniferous the southern part of Gondwana migrated over the South Pole resulting in a major ice sheet over the early Karoo basin and surrounding highlands. Glacial sedimentation in upland valleys and on the lowland shelf resulted in the Dwyka Formation at the base of the Karoo Sequence. After glaciation, an extensive shallow sea covered the gently subsiding shelf, fed by large volumes of meltwater. Marine clays and muds accumulated under cool climatic conditions (Lower Ecca Group) including the distinctive Mesosaurus-bearing carbonaceous shales of the Whitehill Formation. Subduction of the palaeo-Pacific plate reslted in an extensive chain of mountains which deformed and later truncated the southern rim of the main Karoo Basin. Material derived from these "Gondwanide" mountains as well as from the granitic uplands to the north-east, accumulated in large deltas that prograded into the Ecca sea (Upper Ecca Group). The relatively cool and humid climate promoted thick accumulations of peat on the fluvial and delta plains which now constitute the major coal reserves of southern Africa. As the prograding deltas coalesced, fluvio-lacustrine sediments of the Beaufort Group were laid down on broad gently subsiding alluvial plains. The climate by this time (Late Permian) had warmed to become semi-arid with highly seasonal rainfall. Vegetation alongside the meander belts and semi-permanent lakes supported a diverse reptilian fauna dominated by therapsids or "mammal-like reptiles". Pulses of uplift in the southern source areas combined with possible orographic effects resulted in the progadation of two coarse-grained alluvial fans into the central parts of the basin (Katberg Sandstone Member and Molteno Formation). In the upper Karoo Sequence, progressive aridification and tectonic deformation of the basin through the late Triassic and early Jurassic led to the accumulation, in four separate depositories, of "redbeds" which are interpreted as fluvial and flood-fan, playa and dune complexes (Elliot Formation). This eventually gave way to westerly wind-dominated sedimentation that choked the remaining depositories with fine-grained dune sand. The interdune areas were damp and occasionally flooded and provided a habitat for small dinosaurs and the earliest mammals. During this time (Early Jurassic), basinwide volcanic activity began as a precursor to the break-up of Gondwana in the late Jurassic and continued until the early Cretaceous. This extrusion of extensive flood basalts (Drakensberg Group) onto the Clarens landscape eventually brought Karoo sedimentation to a close. ?? 1993.},

abstract = {The end-Triassic is characterized by enhanced rates of biotic turnover in both the marine and terrestrial realms. Carbon-isotope anomalies have been reported worldwide that may indicate coeval global disturbances in the biogeochemical cycles. Here we present the results of an integrated study of the palynomorph assemblages and the carbon-isotope composition of organic matter in the Tiefengraben section near St Wolfgang (Austria). Carbon-isotope values from bulk organic matter show significant fluctuations through the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary interval with two prominent negative $\delta$13Corg excursions. An initial negative carbon-isotope excursion occurs at the base of the Kendlbach Formation, Tiefengraben Member (= Pre-Planorbis Beds). Although Triassic ammonoids and conodonts have their highest occurrence at the top of the underlying K{\"{o}}ssen Formation, the palynomorph and calcareous microfossil assemblages indicate still a Rhaetian age for the lower part of the Tiefengraben Member. High abundance of prasinophytes during the interval of the initial carbon-isotope excursion may represent a bloom of green algae that flourished as a result of the disturbance of the marine ecosystems. Increased spore abundance together with the disappearance of distinctive Late Triassic pollen types (e.g. Ovalipollis, Rhaetipollis) indicate vegetation changes on land that are contemporaneous with the marine biotic crisis. A second negative carbon-isotope excursion occurs in the middle part of the Tiefengraben Member. Based on palynological evidence, the T-J boundary may be drawn at about this level by the lowest occurrence of Cerebropollenites thiergartii. The established carbon-isotope curve, as well as palynostratigraphic and other biostratigraphic events, can be correlated with St Audrie's Bay (England). {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {An open-system chemostat technique was employed to study temperature and precipitation rate effects on carbon isotopic fractionation during the inorganic precipitation of aragonite and calcite from solutions held at constant chemical and isotopic composition.

3) average 1.0 ?? 0.2{\%}. and are essentially constant throughout the range of temperatures (10, 25, and 40??C) and precipitation rates (1026 to 104.8 ??mol m-2 h-1) studied. Calcite-CO2(g) enrichment factors (??{\{}lunate{\}}cl-CO2) are temperature sensitive and are described by the equation ??{\{}lunate{\}}cl-CO2 = 11.98(??0.13) -0.12(??0.01) ?? T(??C). Aragonite-bicarbonate enrichment factors (??{\{}lunate{\}}ar-HCO-

3 data are independent of temperature and display no precipitation rate effect at 10??C, a small negative relationship to rate at 25??C, and a small positive relationship to rate at 40??C. The relative weakness of the effect coupled with the lack of consistency in the trends suggests that ??{\{}lunate{\}}ar-HCO-
3 is independent of rate for most geologic processes. Aragonite-CO2(g) enrichment factors (??{\{}lunate{\}}ar-CO2) are temperature-sensitive and are described by the equation ??{\{}lunate{\}}ar-CO2 = 13.88(??0.16) -0.13(??0.01) ?? T(??C). Aragonite-calcite fractionation (??{\{}lunate{\}}ar-cl) is 1.7 ?? 0.4{\%}. and is independent of temperature from 10 to 40??C. While the enrichment factors obtained here agree with those of some previous studies, temperature and rate effects do not. Our results, which benefit from better control on precipitate mineralogy and precipitation rate, are probably the most accurate to date. ?? 1992.},

abstract = {The trace elements Re and Mo both behave conservatively in seawater yet are strongly enriched in reducing sediments. Their potential for authigenic enrichment above crustal concentrations is greater than for many other elements, due to the high ratio of [metal]sw/[metal]crust. We present sedimentary Re and Mo data from box- and multi-cores spanning a range of redox conditions, from well-oxygenated sites to locations with substantial sulfide concentrations. At the oxic sites, Re and Mo, as expected, accumulate at concentrations close to their crustal abundances. Re shows substantial enrichment in suboxic (absence of O2 and H2S) sediments of the Sea of Japan, in sediments within the oxygen minimum of the Pakistan margin, as well as in sediments underlying the sulfide-bearing waters of the Black Sea and Saanich Inlet. Re enrichment occurs in these cores just below the depths of Fe and U reduction. Only in the sediments underlying the sulfidic waters of the Black Sea and Saanich Inlet is there substantial authigenic Mo accumulation. Absence of Re and Mo enrichments in sediment trap samples from the sulfide-bearing basins suggests that the addition of both metals occurs at or below the sediment-water interface. The Re and Mo concentration profiles are modeled to hindcast the removal depth of Re and Mo in the sediments which, along with the Re/Mo ratio, determine whether oxic, suboxic or sulfidic conditions were present in the water column or in the sediments in the past. Using this approach, historical redox conditions can be inferred even in environments such as continental margins where a substantial lithogenic component can obscure authigenic enrichments of other metals.},

abstract = {A review of the palynofloral succession at the well-documented Triassic–Jurassic boundary sites – Kuhjoch (Austria), St Audrie's Bay (UK), Stenlille (Denmark), Astartekl{\o}ft (Greenland), Sverdrup Basin (Arctic Canada), Northern Carnarvon Basin (Western Australia), Southeast Queensland (eastern Australia) and New Zealand – show all sites experienced major to moderate re-organization of the terrestrial vegetation during the end-Triassic event. The changes led to subsequent taxonomic losses of between 17{\%} and 73{\%} of the Rhaetian pre-extinction palynoflora. The majority of the typical Rhaetian taxa that disappear are so far not known from in situ occurrences in reproductive structures of macrofossil plant taxa. From an ecological perspective, the most dramatic changes occurred in the Sverdrup Basin, Stenlille, Kuhjoch and Carnarvon Basin, where the pre- and post-extinction palynofloras were fundamentally different in both composition and dominance. These changes correspond to ecological severity Category I of McGhee et al. (2004), while the remaining sites are placed in their Subcategory IIa because there the pre-extinction ecosystems are disrupted, but recover and are not replaced post-extinction. Increased total abundances of spores on both hemispheres during the extinction and recovery intervals may indicate that environmental and/or climatic conditions became less favourable for seed plants. Such conditions may include expected effects of volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, such as acid rain, terrestrial soil and freshwater acidification due to volcanic sulfur dioxide emissions, fluctuating ultraviolet flux due to ozone depletion caused by halogens and halocarbon compounds, and drastic changes in climatic conditions due to greenhouse gas emissions.},

@article{Jorgensen2006,
abstract = {With 1.3 109 Tg (teragram = megaton = 1012 g) of sulfur present as sulfate, the oceans represent one of the largest sulfur pools on earth (Vairavamurthy et al. 1995). The main influx of sulfur to the oceans occurs via river water carrying the products of mechanical and chemical weathering of continental rocks. Relative to this fluvial input, the atmospheric transport of sulfur is of minor importance. It mainly consists of recycled oceanic sulfate from seaspray, volcanic sulfur gases, H2S released by sulfate-reducing bacteria, organic Sbearing compounds released into seawater and subsequently into the atmosphere by phytoplankton, and anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide. Due to the oxic conditions that prevail in the world's oceans, the dominant sulfur species in seawater is by far the sulfate ion (SO4 2-). Sulfate is the second most abundant anion next to chloride and has a concentration of 29 mM (2.71 g/kg) in ocean water. Marine sediments are the main sink for seawater sulfate which demonstrates that the sedimentary sulfur cycle is a major component of the global sulfur cycle. The most important mechanisms for removing sulfate from the oceans to the sediments are (1) the bacterial reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide, which subsequently reacts with iron to form sulfide minerals, particularly pyrite (FeS2), (2) the formation of organic sulfur, i.e. the incorporation of sulfur into sedimentary organic matter during early diagenesis, and (3) the precipitation of calcium sulfate minerals in evaporites (Vairavamurthy et al. 1995). With respect to the relative importance of each pathway, Vairavamurthy et al. (1995) point out that although marine evaporites were important sinks for sulfate from the Late Precambrian to the late Tertiary, their rate of formation in today's oceans, over the last few million years, is quantitatively insignificant. Thus, they conclude that the burial of sulfide minerals and, to a less extent, of organic sulfur represents the major sink for oceanic sulfur in the modern ocean.},

abstract = {Research in the western United States to reinvestigate and characterize the previously reported stromatolites of the latest Early Triassic (Spathian) Virgin Limestone Member of the Moenkopi Formation has shown that these microbial build-ups formed patch reef mounds. Detailed field analysis of these reef mounds and the surrounding beds has established that they attained 1-2 m of topographic relief above the seafloor. A petrographic study of these microbial mounds illustrates that they consisted of microbial fabrics, as well as voids with early marine cements and formed in the absence of in situ metazoans. These reef mounds formed during the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction that spanned the Early Triassic. Due to the devastation of marine metazoans at this extinction, the Early Triassic has often been deemed a reef gap because no metazoan reefs are found at this time. Whereas colonial metazoan reefs are globally absent from Lower Triassic strata, microbial build-ups similar to these described from the western United States have been found in south China, Armenia, southern Turkey and Greenland. A regional Early Permian to late Early Triassic unconformity exists in the study region. However, analysis of these microbial reefs within a global context suggests that conditions favouring microbial reef development must have existed as long as 4-8 m.y. after the end-Permian mass extinction. A depositional model of these microbial mounds indicates that flooding of the shelf with anoxic and/or CO2-rich deep waters may have fostered their occurrence. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These processes may have been overlooked because in nature, the sulfide produced by sulfate reduction immediately oxidizes back to sulfate.

abstract = {Bacterial populations, microbial and mineral-forming processes, and their products were analyzed in Lagoa Vermelha, Brazil. The microbial mat and underlying sediment were studied as a unique system to define the boundary conditions responsible for high Mg-calcite and dolomite formation. In the uppermost layers of the microbial mat, oxygenic photosynthesis and aerobic respiration resulted in calcite precipitation, whereas, in the underlying anoxic layers of the mat, sulfide oxidation and sulfate reduction induced formation of a range of carbonate minerals with increasing Mg concentrations. The chemical, min eralogical, and biological conditions presently found in Lagoa Vermelha may have been more common in the Precambrian. The microorganisms performing the metabolic processes related to carbonate mineral formation within Lagoa Vermelha's hypersaline microbial mat may have already been present in the Precambrian. Thus, microbial carbonate as a biomineral could be a record of metabolism throughout geological time. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

By this "bio-ventilation" activity, the worm pushes the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) zone downward to the posterior end of its body, and simultaneously physically separates the sulfide produced during the anaerobic oxidation of methane from oxygen. While there is little scope for the AOM to take place in the tubeworm's body, 70{\%} of the sulfide that is produced by sulfate reduction processes or that is advected in the sediment is preferentially shunted via the organism where it is oxidised by endosymbionts providing the energy for the worm's growth. The process of sulfide reoxidation, occurring predominantly in the worm's body is thus very distinct from the anaerobic oxidation of methane, which is a diffuse process that takes place in the sediments in the methane-sulfate transition zone. We show how the sulfide oxidation process is affected by increasing densities and length of the frenulates, and by upward advection velocity. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Our biogeochemical model is one of the first to describe tubeworms explicitly.

abstract = {Lake Van harbors the largest known microbialites on Earth. The surface of these huge carbonate pinnacles is covered by coccoid cyanobacteria whereas their central axis is occupied by a channel through which neutral, relatively Ca-enriched, groundwater flows into highly alkaline (pH approximately 9.7) Ca-poor lake water. Previous microscopy observations showed the presence of aragonite globules composed by rounded nanostructures of uncertain origin that resemble similar bodies found in some meteorites. Here, we have carried out fine-scale mineralogical and microbial diversity analyses from surface and internal microbialite samples. Electron transmission microscopy revealed that the nanostructures correspond to rounded aragonite nanoprecipitates. A progressive mineralization of cells by the deposition of nanoprecipitates on their surface was observed from external towards internal microbialite areas. Molecular diversity studies based on 16S rDNA amplification revealed the presence of bacterial lineages affiliated to the Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria, the Cyanobacteria, the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides (CFB) group, the Actinobacteria and the Firmicutes. Cyanobacteria and CFB members were only detected in surface layers. The most abundant and diverse lineages were the Firmicutes (low GC Gram positives). To the exclusion of cyanobacteria, the closest cultivated members to the Lake Van phylotypes were most frequently alkaliphilic and/or heterotrophic bacteria able to degrade complex organics. These heterotrophic bacteria may play a crucial role in the formation of Lake Van microbialites by locally promoting carbonate precipitation.},

abstract = {Minor and trace element compositions of a suite of Ordovician, Silurian, and Permian conodonts have been characterised by laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). Continuous, high-resolution chemical depth profiles through individual conodont elements reveal systematic compositional differences between the component histologies (albid, hyaline, and basal body tissues). Comparative analyses of contemporaneous bio-apatites (ichthyoliths and inarticulate brachiopods), as well as Holocene and modern fish material, show linear relationships between their respective rare earth element, yttrium, lead, thorium, and uranium compositions, which has implications for their relative permeability and susceptibility to diagenesis. Assessment of LA-ICPMS profiles in the context of histology, general morphological structure, and post-depositional chemical exchange, suggests that conodont albid crown is the least permeable histology, whereas hyaline crown, basal tissue, ichthyoliths, and inarticulate brachiopods are strongly overprinted by the selective uptake of Y-REE-Th-U during diagenesis. Conodont albid crown is therefore more resistant than other bio-apatite histologies to postmortem uptake of Y-REE-Th-U, and trends below detection limits that more closely approach primary conodont compositions. This relationship between sample histology and geochemistry, especially in the context of diagenetic overprinting, demands careful consideration when reconstructing palaeoseawater compositions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The end of Permian time (252-251Ma) hosts the largest mass extinction in Earth history, yet events heralding this global catastrophe remain intensely disputed. We present a chemostratigraphic marker, the 187Re/188Os ratio, which soars to unprecedented levels approaching the Permo-Triassic boundary. These ratios are tied to profound trace element changes and a precise Re-Os time record at 252Ma preserved in black shales from East Greenland and the mid-Norwegian shelf. Within a 36-meter shale section, an 80-fold increase in Re concentrations (two-fold for Os) signals seawater conditions that became increasingly inhospitable to life. Unwavering initial 187Os/188Os ratios of 0.6 preclude mafic volcanism and meteorite impact as the direct cause of Late Permian anoxia. We argue that extraordinarily high 187Re/188Os ratios are the hallmark of simultaneously rising ocean temperature and acidity, leading to loss of oxygen and the stifling of life in latest Permian time. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The ecological competition between brachiopods and bivalves is analysed by means of a quantitative palaeoecologic method applied on four assemblages located within a short stratigraphic interval, approximately 2 m thick, in the lower Tesero Member of the Werfen Formation (in the Southern Alps). The assemblages originate from the Tesero, Bulla and Sass de Putia sections. The analysed stratigraphic interval, uppermost Changhsingian in age, is located between the early and heaviest phase of the end-Permian mass extinction, which occurred across the Bellerophon/Werfen formational boundary (Event Boundary), and the Permian/Triassic boundary (Chronological Boundary), when nearly all the Permian stenotopic holdovers disappeared. These assemblages are characterised by small sized skeletons ("Lilliput effect"), which represent an adaptive survival strategy in stressed and harsh habitats resulting from the climatic and palaeoceanographic changes connected with the mass extinction. The Tesero assemblages are dominated by rhynchonelliform brachiopod Orbicoelia (bed CNT10) or Streptorhynchus (bed CNT11A), which were mostly attached at the top of shallow microbialitic mounds. These assemblages are again dominated by Permian stenotopic taxa and show a Palaeozoic structure. The Tesero habitat, which again permitted the survival of brachiopods, represented one of the last refuges in the western Tethys. On the contrary, the Bulla (BU9-10) and Sass de Putia (wPK13A) assemblages are bivalve-dominated, and thus show an ecologic structure typical of Early Triassic post-extinction marine benthic communities or Palaeozoic stressed marine communities. The bivalve-dominated assemblages proliferated in prevailing muddy siliciclastic substrates, with brief episodes of microbial algal growth. The most important environmental limiting factors and leading causes of end-Permian mass extinction are discussed in terms of palaeoautecologic and palaeosynecologic analysis. The different taxonomic composition and ecologic structure of the assemblages is related to palaeogeography, including water depth and connections with the open sea. The brachiopod-dominated assemblage, exclusive of the Tesero section, proliferated in microbial carbonate habitats in near-shore environments. The bivalve-dominated assemblages, which were more widespread than the brachiopod assemblages in the Dolomites and also occurred in other western Tethys localities, occur in more open and deeper marine environments. In the western Tethys margins, the local distribution of mixed faunas suggests that the extinction of Permian stenotopic taxa was caused by the onset of poisonous water on the shelves originating from deep marine environments. This extinction pattern appears to be a regional phenomenon and does not seem be applicable on a global scale. The extinction events were controlled by a complex network of interactive factors and the survival of faunal elements was probably stochastic. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Sulfur isotope fractionation experiments during bacterial sulfate reduction were performed with recently isolated strains of cold-adapted sulfate-reducing bacteria from Arctic marine sediments with year-round temperatures below 2°C. The bacteria represent quantitatively important members of a high-latitude anaerobic microbial community. In the experiments, cell-specific sulfate reduction rates decreased with decreasing temperature and were only slightly higher than the inferred cell-specific sulfate reduction rates in their natural habitat. The experimentally determined isotopic fractionations varied by less than 5.8‰ with respect to temperature and sulfate reduction rate, whereas the difference in sulfur isotopic fractionation between bacteria with different carbon oxidation pathways was as large as 17.4‰. Incubation of sediment slurries from two Arctic localities across an experimental temperature gradient from -4°C to 39°C yielded an isotopic fractionation of 30‰ below 7.6°C, a fractionation of 14‰ and 15.5‰ between 7.6°C and 25°C, and fractionations of 5‰ and 8‰ above 25°C, respectively. In absence of significant differences in sulfate reduction rates in the high and low temperature range, respectively, we infer that different genera of sulfate-reducing bacteria dominate the sulfate-reducing bacterial community at different temperatures. In the Arctic sediments where these bacteria are abundant the isotopic differences between dissolved sulfate, pyrite, and acid-volatile sulfide are at least twice as large as the experimentally determined isotopic fractionations. On the basis of bacterial abundance and cell-specific sulfate reduction rates, these greater isotopic differences cannot be accounted for by significantly lower in situ bacterial sulfate reduction rates. Therefore, the remaining isotopic difference between sulfate and sulfide must derive from additional isotope effects that exist in the oxidative part of the sedimentary sulfur cycle.

abstract = {It has been suggested, on the basis of modern hydrology and fully coupled palaeoclimate simulations, that the warm greenhouse conditions that characterized the early Palaeogene period (55-45 Myr ago) probably induced an intensified hydrological cycle with precipitation exceeding evaporation at high latitudes. Little field evidence, however, has been available to constrain oceanic conditions in the Arctic during this period. Here we analyse Palaeogene sediments obtained during the Arctic Coring Expedition, showing that large quantities of the free-floating fern Azolla grew and reproduced in the Arctic Ocean by the onset of the middle Eocene epoch (approximately 50 Myr ago). The Azolla and accompanying abundant freshwater organic and siliceous microfossils indicate an episodic freshening of Arctic surface waters during an approximately 800,000-year interval. The abundant remains of Azolla that characterize basal middle Eocene marine deposits of all Nordic seas probably represent transported assemblages resulting from freshwater spills from the Arctic Ocean that reached as far south as the North Sea. The termination of the Azolla phase in the Arctic coincides with a local sea surface temperature rise from approximately 10 degrees C to 13 degrees C, pointing to simultaneous increases in salt and heat supply owing to the influx of waters from adjacent oceans. We suggest that onset and termination of the Azolla phase depended on the degree of oceanic exchange between Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas.},

abstract = {Focusing on the Permian-Triassic boundary, ca. 251 Ma, I explore the possibility that mass extinction can be caused by an extremely fast, explosive release of dissolved methane (and other dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) that accumulated in the oceanic water masses prone to stagnation and anoxia (e.g., in silled basins). The mechanism of the explosive release is the same as in the Lake Nyos disaster of 1986, i.e., a water-column eruption caused by the interplay of buoyancy forces and exsolution of dissolved gas. The eruption brings to the surface deep anoxic waters that cause extinctions in the marine realm. Terrestrial extinctions are caused by explosions and conflagrations that follow the massive release of methane (the air-methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5{\%} and 15{\%}) and by the eruption-triggered floods. This scenario accounts well for the available data, and may be relevant to other phenomena.},

@article{Whiticar1998,
abstract = {Ikaite is a rare form of carbonate - calcium carbonate hexahydrate (CaCO 3 {\textperiodcentered}6H 2 O) and is the precursor to thinolites. Metastable 'ikaite' crystals, discovered in unconsolidated marine sediments in the King George Basin in the Bransfield Strait, Antarctica, are related to diagenetic remineralization reactions of organic matter. Stable C, O, and H-isotopes track the response of ikaite crystals, during growth, to changing interstitial fluid conditions as a result of bacterial sulphate reduction and methanogenesis. Ikaites form in preference over calcite or aragonite at the prevailing surface sediment conditions of -1.6°C and 200 bar in the King George Basin. The calcareous tufa towers of the terrestrial, hypersaline Mono Lake of northern California are CaCO 3 -precipitates formed by the influx of submerged springs of calcium-rich freshwaters entering the alkaline lake ($\Sigma$CO 2 = 0.5 m, pH = 9.8). Under current climatic conditions the mineral calcite precipitates, but during the colder Tioga glacial period of Late Wisconsian age (12,000 to 9,000 years BP), and possibly present day during the winter season, the monoclinic calcium carbonate hexahydrate (ikaite) was the dominant phase formed. These paleo-ikaites have since recrystallized to form the calcitic pseudomorph 'thinolites'. They are found elsewhere in recent and ancient sediments of polar regions, e.g., as 'glendonites'. The environmental occurrence of ikaites and their pseudomorphs deem them as potential paleoclimatic indicators of cold environments. The larger crystals are typically restricted to colder, deeper organic-rich sediments or in moderately evaporitic basins. In these cases, the ikaite formation and decomposition may be influenced by additives such as phosphate or amino acids.},

A new database has been presented by Benton(2), who argues that the increase in diversity is exponential, that ''there is no need to assume equilibrium levels of global diversity, nor to apply logistic models to the investigation of past diversification patterns'', and that mass extinctions played no special role in the diversification of life, However, we find that diversification can be predicted by a simple model in which long periods of growth obeying a logistic equation are sporadically interrupted by brief events leading to mass extinction, The initial value of diversity immediately after a mass extinction, initial growth rate and subsequent equilibrium level determine each segment of the growth curve, The larger mass extinctions that came after long periods without one seem to have been followed by larger equilibrium levels of diversity.},

abstract = {The Upper Carboniferous to Upper Permian deposits of the Sverdrup Basin (Arctic Canada) record a transition from carbonate to silica dominated shallow shelf ecosystems. Chert expansion started during the latest Carboniferous in distal deep-water slope environments when prolific warm-water, photozoan carbonate factories developed on the adjacent shallow shelves. A shift to heterozoan factories during the Sakmarian–Artinskian was caused by the introduction of cooler water in response to paleoceanographic changes along NW Pangea. By Kungurian time, heterozoan carbonate factories narrowed substantially while hyalosponge factories had expanded well into the mid shelves. A brief return to widespread heterozoan carbonate sedimentation occurred during the Wordian, followed by further encroachment of shallow shelves by biosiliceous factories during the Capitanian and Wuchiapingian. A major drop in relative rates of carbonate sediment accumulation with time suggests both carbonate and biosiliceous factories were under considerable stress prior to the Late Permian Extinction event. It is proposed that Sverdrup Basin waters became progressively more acidic in response to build up of atmospheric CO2 throughout the Permian which led to a gradual shoaling of the lysocline and the calcite compensation depth, which was amplified by upwelling along the northwestern margin of Pangea. Ocean acidification initiated in response to amalgamation of the Pangea supercontinent. This inhibited the silicate weathering-response through development of thick protective soil blankets. A temperature shock associated with the extinction event led to a major fall of the lysocline allowing carbonates to resume accumulation in spite of low pH conditions. The subsequent die off of terrestrial vegetation, stripping of soil cover, widespread continental erosion and repeated exposures of fresh rock surfaces associated with a major base level shift allowed silicate weathering to restart and drive oceans back to carbonate saturation.},

abstract = {Global environmental changes, including ocean acidification, have been identified as a major threat to scleractinian corals. General predictions are that ocean acidification will be detrimental to reef growth and that 40 to more than 80 per cent of present-day reefs will decline during the next 50 years. Cold-water corals (CWCs) are thought to be strongly affected by changes in ocean acidification owing to their distribution in deep and/or cold waters, which naturally exhibit a CaCO(3) saturation state lower than in shallow/warm waters. Calcification was measured in three species of Mediterranean cold-water scleractinian corals (Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum dianthus) on-board research vessels and soon after collection. Incubations were performed in ambient sea water. The species M. oculata was additionally incubated in sea water reduced or enriched in CO(2). At ambient conditions, calcification rates ranged between -0.01 and 0.23{\%} d(-1). Calcification rates of M. oculata under variable partial pressure of CO(2) (pCO(2)) were the same for ambient and elevated pCO(2) (404 and 867 µatm) with 0.06 ± 0.06{\%} d(-1), while calcification was 0.12 ± 0.06{\%} d(-1) when pCO(2) was reduced to its pre-industrial level (285 µatm). This suggests that present-day CWC calcification in the Mediterranean Sea has already drastically declined (by 50{\%}) as a consequence of anthropogenic-induced ocean acidification.},

abstract = {Mesozoic basins that preserve extrusive basalts of the 200 Ma Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) may total about 300,000 km (super 2) . However, dikes and sills of CAMP that fed the basin basalts are spread across an area greater than 10 million km (super 2) within four continents. In addition, basalts of the east coast margin igneous province (ECMIP) of North America, which cause the east coast magnetic anomaly, covered about 60,000 km (super 2) with perhaps 1.3 million km (super 3) of extrusive lavas. If only half of the continental CAMP area was originally covered by 200 m of lava, the total volume of CAMP and ECMIP surface basalt exceeds 2.3 million km (super 3) and may be the largest known subaerial flood basalt event. Averages of volatile contents of eastern North American CAMP tholeiitic dikes and sills, in weight {\%}, are: CO (sub 2) = 0.066; S = 0.046; F = 0.032; and Cl = 0.064. Atmospheric emissions of volatiles from extrusive basalts can be reasonably estimated as half of the volatile content of the comagmatic intrusive basalts, mainly as gaseous plumes from lava curtains at the erupting fissures. Volcanic emissions of these gases therefore ranged between 1.13E+12 and 2.33E+12 metric tons, enough for major world-wide environmental problems. Climatic effects could include both immediate cooling from S converted to sulfuric acid haze, and a longer period of greenhouse effects from the CO (sub 2) . The substantial F and Cl would be short-term poisons. Radiometric and stratigraphic ages indicate most of the magmatic activity was brief, widespread, and close to the Tr-J boundary, which is marked by a profound mass extinction. A causal connection between these great volatile emissions and the mass extinction has not been demonstrated within Mesozoic basins, so it may depend upon how precisely radiometric dates for the basalts bracket the Tr-J boundary.},

abstract = {The {\~{}}635 Ma Marinoan glaciation is marked by dramatic Earth system perturbations. Deposition of nonmass-dependently (17)O-depleted sulfate (SO4(2-)) in worldwide postglacial sediments is, thus far, unique to this glaciation. It is proposed that an extremely high-pCO2 atmosphere can result in highly (17)O-depleted atmospheric O2, or the Marinoan Oxygen-17 Depletion (MOSD) event. This anomalous (17)O signal was imparted to sulfate of oxidative weathering origin. However, (17)O-depleted sulfate occurs in limited sedimentary intervals, suggesting that Earth surface conditions conducive to the MOSD had a finite duration. An MOSD duration can, therefore, provide much needed constraint on modeling Earth system responses at that time. Unfortunately, the sulfate (17)O record is often sparse or lacks radiometric dates. Here, we report 11 barite layers from a post-Marinoan dolostone sequence at Wushanhu in the South China Block. The (17)O depletion fluctuates in magnitude in lower layers but is persistently absent up section, providing the most confident first and last sedimentary appearance of the anomaly. $\delta$(13)C chemostratigraphy is used to correlate the Wushanhu section to two proximal sections on the same shallow platform that lack barite layers but have published U-Pb dates that occur in dolostone and shale. Assuming a similar pattern and rate for carbonate and shale deposition among the different sections, we estimate the MOSD duration at 0-0.99 My. This number can be further constrained by new radiometric dates from equivalent sequences worldwide, thus underpinning models on the nonsteady-state Earth system response in the immediate aftermath of the Marinoan meltdown.},

To analyze these fluctuations, we examine records of both the isotopic content of carbonate carbon and the fractionation between carbonate and marine organic carbon. Together, these are inconsistent with conventional, steady-state models of the carbon cycle. The records can be well understood, however, as deriving from the nonsteady dynamics of two reactive pools of carbon. The lack of a steady state is traced to an unusually large oceanic reservoir of organic carbon. We suggest that the most significant of the Neoproterozoic negative carbon-isotopic excursions resulted from increased remineralization of this reservoir. The terminal event, at the Proterozoic-Cambrian boundary, signals the final diminution of the reservoir, a process that was likely initiated by evolutionary innovations that increased export of organic matter to the deep sea.},

abstract = {To reconstruct the cycling of reactive phosphorus (P) in the Bering Sea, a P speciation record covering the last {\~{}}4Ma was generated from sediments recovered during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323 at Site U1341 (Bowers Ridge). A chemical extraction procedure distinguishing between different operationally defined P fractions provides new insight into reactive P input, burial and diagenetic transformations. Reactive P mass accumulation rates (MARs) are {\~{}}20-110$\mu$mol/cm2/ka, which is comparable to other open ocean locations but orders of magnitude lower than most upwelling settings. We find that authigenic carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) and opal-bound P are the dominant P fractions at Site U1341. An overall increasing contribution of CFA to total P with sediment depth is consistent with a gradual "sink switching" from more labile P fractions (fish remains, Fe oxides, organic matter) to stable authigenic CFA. However, the positive correlation of CFA with Al content implies that a significant portion of the supposedly reactive CFA is non-reactive "detrital contamination" by eolian and/or riverine CFA. In contrast to CFA, opal-bound P has rarely been studied in marine sediments. We find for the first time that opal-bound P directly correlates with excess silica contents. This P fraction was apparently available to biosiliceous phytoplankton at the time of sediment deposition and is a long-term sink for reactive P in the ocean, despite the likelihood for diagenetic re-mobilisation of this P at depth (indicated by increasing ratios of excess silica to opal-bound P). Average reactive P MARs at Site U1341 increase by {\~{}}25{\%} if opal-bound P is accounted for, but decrease by {\~{}}25{\%} if 50{\%} of the extracted CFA fraction (based on the lowest CFA value at Site U1341) is assumed to be detrital. Combining our results with literature data, we present a qualitative perspective of terrestrial CFA and opal-bound P deposition in the modern ocean. Riverine CFA input has mostly been reported from continental shelves and margins draining P-rich lithologies, while eolian CFA input is found across wide ocean regions underlying the Northern Hemispheric "dust belt". Opal-bound P burial is important in the Southern Ocean, North Pacific, and likely in upwelling areas. Shifts in detrital CFA and opal-bound P deposition across ocean basins likely occurred over time, responding to changing weathering patterns, sea level, and biogenic opal deposition. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Porewater concentrations of sulfate, methane, and other relevant constituents were determined on four sediment cores from the high productivity upwelling area off Namibia which were recovered from the continental slope at water depths of 1300 and 2000 m. At all four stations a distinct sulfate-methane transition zone was observed several meters below the seafloor in which both sulfate and methane are consumed. Nutrient porewater concentration profiles do not show gradient slope changes at the depths of the transition zones. Flux calculations carried out on the basis of the determined porewater profiles revealed that anaerobic methane oxidation accounts for 100{\%} of deep sulfate reduction within the sulfate-methane transition zone and consumes the total net diffusive sulfate flux. A significant contribution of organic carbon oxidation to the reduction of sulfate at these depths could, therefore, be excluded. We state that porewater profiles of sulfate with constant gradients above the transition zones are indicative for anaerobic methane oxidation controlling sulfate reduction.},

Such an atmosphere should have led to the formation of outcrops rich in carbonate minerals, for which evidence has been sparse. Using the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit, we have now identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16 to 34 weight percent) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Its composition approximates the average composition of the carbonate globules in martian meteorite ALH 84001.

Marine paleoproductivity, as represented by mass accumulation rates of CaCO3 and organic carbon, increased over this time interval. We postulate that the larger Corganic/Ntotal values record a shift towards greater recycling rates of nitrogen-rich, relative to carbon-rich, organic matter components as the flux of total organic matter to the seafloor increased. Furthermore, we propose that high Corganic/Ntotal values may record enhanced paleoproductivity in other sedimentary sequences dominated by marine organic matter.},

abstract = {A distinct negative ??13C excursion is documented in two Permian-Triassic sections (Heping and Taiping) in shallow marine carbonate platform deposits in the Nanpanjiang Basin, south China. These sections span from the Changhsingian to the Dienerian and are characterized by a distinct marine boundary facies change from massive, skeletal lime packstone in the Changhsingian to distinctive calcimicrobial framestone in the Griesbachian Hindeodus parvus Zone. The ??13Corg and ?? 13Ccarb excursions occur directly after the onset of the calcimicrobial framestone (herein termed the 'Permian-Triassic boundary event') and before the first occurrence of H. parvus. The isotope shifts are associated with a sharp drop in species abundance and diversity and coincide with a decrease in total organic carbon (TOC) content. The shift towards depleted values in ??13Corg and ??13C carb at the Permian-Triassic boundary event, together with low TOC contents, persists throughout the Griesbachian H. parvus Zone. These data document a corresponding negative shift of ??13Corg and ??13Ccarb, values and low TOC contents with the onset of growth of calcified microbial framestones (a postextinction 'disaster facies') immediately below the base of the Griesbachian H. parvus Zone. Based on paleontological evidence, the first occurrence of the 'disaster facies' follows the extinction event, which implies that the 13C-depleted values above this facies postdate the event. This suggests that two separate events had to account for the initiation of the extinction and the ?? 13C excursion. However, the consequences that led to the negative isotopic shift might be linked to the intriguing recovery lag of Early Triassic ecosystems. Based on data from PTB sections worldwide of a greater ?? 13C offset in high compared with low latitudes, we propose that methane eruptions from thermal destabilization of high-latitude clathrate deposits may have led to the negative ??13C shift and may have caused long-term adverse ecological conditions. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A new Raman spectroscopic technique has been refined to more efficiently determine the crystallinity indeces of biogenic apatites. We investigate the possible relationships between the structure (crystallinity) and geochemistry (rare earth element (REE), $\delta$18O) of biogenic apatites. A selection of phosphatic remains dated from present to about 510 Ma (Late Cambrian), for most of which either the oxygen isotope compositions or REE patterns are available, has been characterized for crystallinity using Raman spectroscopy. We define a new crystallinity index (CIRaman) from the ratio of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the intense peak of the PO4 symmetric stretching mode in the sample and a reference magmatic apatite. In order to compare our crystallinity index with CI used in previously published studies, we also analyzed part of our sample set with FT-IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometry. A detailed study of natural samples demonstrates that crystallinity index is a poor criterion for determining if a sample has been altered since deposition. This result is based on three major observations: (1) independently of the CIRaman, the original geochemical signatures of the biogenic apatites can be preserved over a long period, (2) strong geochemical perturbations (lowering of $\delta$18O values and of La/Sm ratios) may occur without detectable recrystallization, and (3) alteration by heating, marked by the transformation of organic matter into graphite, produces REE fractionations and limited oxygen isotope exchange with crustal aqueous fluids.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB, {\~{}}252.3Ma) marks the largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic, with a loss of more than 90{\%} of marine organisms, and is characterized by lethally hot surface temperatures. The PTB global warming has been linked to greenhouse gas emissions from the Siberian Traps and associated coal-bed intrusions and likely led to severe environmental consequences, such as ocean acidification, a decline in the marine productivity, and extensive hypoxia. In order to understand these changes, feedbacks in the climate system have been explored with sensitivity climate simulations and compared to temperature proxies from the sedimentary record. The response of the PTB ocean circulation to an atmospheric perturbation of {\~{}}5000PgC, comparable to Earth's total fossil fuel inventory, leads to a global temperature increase by 3-4°C and an increase in ocean stratification. The pole-to-equator temperature gradient decreases by 2°C with an increase in CO2-radiative forcing, predominately due to snow albedo feedbacks over Gondwana. The greenhouse-induced warming would have led to a weakening of the Hadley cell and an associated decrease in the trade winds and equatorial primary productivity. These climatic changes might have been amplified by cloud-feedback processes. A reduced concentration of cloud condensation nuclei due to a biologic decline of dimethylsulfide caused by the temperature stress or changes in airborne mineral particles could have reduced the cloud albedo, particularly in high latitudes. Results from a climate simulation with reduced cloud albedo suggest a polar warming of up to 7°C and a reduction of the pole-to-equator temperature gradient by {\~{}}4°C in addition to the reduction caused by the increase in greenhouse-induced radiative forcing. The scenario with reduced cloud albedo further leads to an increase in ocean stratification and widespread low-oxygen concentrations in the Panthalassa during the Early Triassic.},

abstract = {The Huangzhishan section, 40 km from the well-known Meishan section, Zhejiang Province, South China, records a carbonate-siliciclastic Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary succession. The P/Tr boundary sequences in both sections correlate well with one another, although the succession is much thicker at Huangzhishan than its equivalent at Meishan. The P/Tr transition is constrained by the Neogondolella yini, N. meishanensis and Hindeodus parvus conodont zones. Of these, the boundary between the first two zones marks the end-Permian mass extinction horizon. The base of H. parvus Zone defines the P/Tr boundary. The P/Tr mass extinction event is also indicated by a dramatic negative shift of the $\delta$13Ccarb profile. This ecological crisis was facilitated by an abrupt environmental devastation indicated by an anoxic event. At Huangzhishan benthic habitats varied from open, oxygenated, to anoxic, to dysoxic-oxygenated and to dysoxic-anoxic conditions throughout the latest Changhsingian to early Griesbachian. Biotic turnover across the P/Tr boundary suggests the P/Tr mass extinction may have included two episodes in Huangzhishan. The first, perhaps major, episode occurs at the base of N. meishanensis Zone, corresponding to the event recorded at the base of Bed 25 in Meishan. The second coincides with the boundary between the H. parvus Zone and overlying Claraia-Ophiceras Assemblage zone, equivalent to the event recorded at the base of Bed 28 in Meishan. The first event did not see a significant decline in biodiversity, but is marked by an apparent loss of high-classification groups such as corals, sponges, macroalgae and most foraminifers. The Huangzhishan section records the most abundant and diverse surviving faunas among the P/Tr boundary sections around the world, with 54 species in 36 genera. However, they are severely affected by the Lilliput effect over the P/Tr extinction. Several fossil groups (bryozoans, blastoids and crinoids) temporarily survived the first episode of the P/Tr extinction and persisted into the earliest Triassic in Huangzhishan. Most survivors became extinct in the second episode of the P/Tr crisis. The Eumorphotis-Towapteria-Pteria bivalve fauna, widespread in shallow-water facies conodont-free P/Tr boundary sections in South China, occurs within the H. parvus Zone in Huangzhishan. This bivalve fauna therefore marks the P/Tr boundary in the conodont-barren P/Tr boundary sections. The top of this bivalve assemblage zone marks the second episode of the P/Tr crisis. Another slightly older bivalve fauna dominated by primitive forms of Claraia (e.g. C. bioni) marks the first/or main episode of the P/Tr extinction in the conodont-barren P/Tr boundary sections.},

abstract = {Biogeochemistry, a branch of Earth System Sciences, focusses on the two-way interactions between organisms and their environment, including the cycling of energy and elements and the functioning of organisms and ecosystems. To this end, physical, chemical, biological and geological processes are studied using field observations, experiments, modelling and theory. The discipline of biogeochemistry has grown to such an extent that sub-disciplines have emerged. Consequently, producing a single comprehensive textbook covering all aspects, e.g., terrestrial, freshwater and marine domains, biogeochemical cycles and budgets of the major biological relevant elements, reconstruction of biogeochemical cycles in the past, earth system modelling, microbiological, organic and inorganic geochemical methods, theory and models, has become unworkable. This book provides a concise treatment of the main concepts in ocean carbon cycling research. It focusses on marine biogeochemical processes impacting the cycling of particulate carbon, in particular organic carbon. Other biogeochemical processes impacting nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, etc., and the identity of the organisms involved are only covered where needed to understand carbon biogeochemistry. Moreover, chemical and biological processes relevant to carbon cycling are central, i.e. for physical processes, the reader might consult the excellent ocean biogeochemical dynamics textbooks of Sarmiento and Gruber (2006; Princeton University Press) and Williams and Follows (2011; Cambridge University Press). My text aims to provide graduate students in marine and earth sciences a conceptual understanding of ocean carbon biogeochemistry, so that they are better equipped to read palaeorecords, can improve carbon biogeochemical models and generate more accurate projections of the functioning of the future ocean. Because the book is targeted at students having a background in environmental and earth sciences, some basic biological concepts are explained. Some basic understanding of calculus is expected. Simple mathematical models are used to highlight the most important factors governing carbon cycling in the ocean. The material here is based on a selection of lectures in my Utrecht University master course on Microbes and Biogeochemical Cycles. This first draft of this book was written during a three-month sabbatical stay at Department of Geosciences, Princeton University (April–June 2018). I thank Bess Ward, chair of that department, for providing a desk and a stimulating environment. This sabbatical stay was supported by a travel grant from the Netherlands Earth System Science Centre. I thank Bernie Boudreau for carefully scrutinizing the initial draft, Mathilde Hagens and Karline Soetaert for feedback on Chap. 5 and Anna de Kluijver for remarks on Chap. 6. Ton Markus improved my draft figures. Finally, I thank my wife and publisher Petra van Steenbergen.},

This study demonstrates that time-resolved Raman spectroscopic$\backslash$nmeasurements can provide complementary and useful information on the$\backslash$nnucleation and growth of particles and crystals from homogeneous and$\backslash$nheterogeneous systems at different pressure-temperature conditions.$\backslash$nThree minerals were chosen for this study: siderite, magnesite, and$\backslash$ncalcite, three carbonate minerals that are widespread in geological$\backslash$nenvironments and have numerous industrial and medical applications. As$\backslash$nexpected, siderite and calcite can rapidly form via an amor-phous$\backslash$nprecursor when using concentrated solutions of reactants directly mixed$\backslash$nat ambient temperature (similar to 25 degrees C) and pressure (similar$\backslash$nto 1 bar) (i.e., via spinodal decomposition or when energetic barrier is$\backslash$nclose to zero). In addition, calcium carbonate clusters and/or probably$\backslash$nalso amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) were detected in the first 5 min$\backslash$nprior to calcite nucleation in a Ca(OH)(2)-H2O-CO2 concentrated slurry$\backslash$nat 25 degrees C and 50 bar. The calcite and siderite crystals, nucleated$\backslash$nfrom their respective amorphous phases, grow by oriented aggregation of$\backslash$ncrystalline nanoparticles leading to porous spherical$\backslash$nsiderite-mesocrystals or nonporous rhombohedral calcite crystals after$\backslash$n24 h of reaction, as deduced from field emission scanning electron$\backslash$nmicroscopy images and X-ray diffraction analyses. Moreover, the$\backslash$npossibility of an Ostwald ripening mechanism contributing to crystal$\backslash$ngrowth is not excluded.

England, includes one of the first documented successions through the Rhaetian stage (latest Triassic) and a classic Triassic-Jurassic boundary section, and, historically, the first ever mention and description of the Rhaetian bone bed, dating back to the 1820s. The larger fossils, abraded vertebrae and limb bones of marine reptiles, have been widely reported, but the microvertebrates from the Aust Cliff Rhaetian basal bone bed have been barely noted, after the classic works of Louis Agassiz, who named 17 fish taxa from Aust in the 1830s, of which eight are still regarded as valid taxa. Here we describe the extensive microvertebrate fauna, including six species of chondrichthyans identified from their teeth, featuring the second ever report of Parascylloides turnerae from the UK, as well as numerous examples of three morphotypes of chondrichthyan placoid scales (denticles). In addition, we report four species of osteichthyans based on their teeth, Gyrolepis, Severnichthys, Sargodon, and Lepidotes, as well as numerous isolated scales, fin rays, and gill rakers, and the second occurrence of cephalopod hooklets from the British Rhaetian. Four types of coprolites are noted, probably produced by these fishes, and these, with evidence from teeth, allow us to present a food web for the classic Rhaetian bone bed seas.},

abstract = {Chemostratigraphic methods ({\{}delta{\}}13Corg) for pinpointing the Permian-Triassic boundary in nonmarine rocks of Antarctica, Australia, and South Africa have drawn attention to unusual claystone breccias at this horizon of the greatest extinction in the history of life on Earth. These rocks differ from other breccias in having a high proportion of clasts with birefringence microfabrics (sepic plasmic fabrics) characteristic of soils, and can be called sepic pedoliths in the terminology of soil science. At many localities, earliest Triassic sepic pedoliths are thin (5-15 cm) beds, but some fill shallow paleochannels, and pinch out laterally. Other non-marine breccias at the Permian-Triassic boundary are dominated by fragments of coal, pedogenic carbonate nodules, and deeply weathered volcanic rock fragments. Earliest Triassic sepic pedoliths record an unusually severe and widespread episode of soil erosion associated with forest dieback at the Permian-Triassic boundary. Comparable sepic pedoliths are found in debris flows after clear-cutting of forests in western Oregon today. Studies of these modern deposits show that sepic soil peds do not withstand weathering for more than a few months. Such clayey clasts are held together mainly by roots and fungi, which decay rapidly in soils and streams. These modern analogs demonstrate that terminal Permian soil erosion was rapid and profound. Sepic pedoliths are also known at other times of mass extinction, such as the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, but are not yet known before the Devonian advent of trees and forested clayey soils.},

abstract = {The Abadeh section, well-exposed in the Hambast Valley in central Iran, has long been one of the most extensively studied sections because of its continuous carbonate-dominated strata from Lower Permian to Lower Triassic. However, biostratigraphy and correlation with the equivalent sequences in other regions remain controversial. In this paper both carbon isotope excursion ($\delta$13Ccarb) and strontium isotope ratio (87Sr/86Sr) based on bulk carbonate samples have been measured to serve as chemostratigraphical proxies to estimate the three different chronostratigraphical boundaries in the Lopingian at the Abadeh section, including the Permian-Triassic Event (PTEB), the Guadalupian-Lopingian (GLB), and the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundaries (WCB). These three boundaries are important for understanding the marine biological evolution around this critical interval. Based on the $\delta$13C excursions, the rising trend of 87Sr/86Sr and the value around 0.7073, and the occurrence of microbialite beds, the Permian-Triassic event boundary (=Bed 25 at the Meishan section) is suggested at -0.5m below the base of the main microbialite bed. The GLB is suggested at -46.5m based on the position of the minor $\delta$13Ccarb negative depletion, coupled with the values between 0.7069 and 0.7070 of 87Sr/86Sr and its beginning point of the rising trend, which is above the lowest value 0.7068 of 87Sr/86Sr ratio in the Paleozoic. The relationship between section thickness and their high-resolution depositional age (projecting age) is interpolated for the whole Lopingian using locally weighted regression scatter plot smoother (LOWESS) of strontium isotopic ratio. Based on the negative $\delta$13C excursion and the value 0.7072 of 87Sr/86Sr ratio, the WCB is estimated at 1m above the lithologic boundary between Unit 6 and Unit 7, much lower than the boundary defined by previous conodont biostratigraphy, but similar to other index fossils. This boundary is projected as ca. 254.6Ma in 87Sr/86Sr-age projecting model and is close to zircon U/Pb dating age from South China. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

abstract = {The cataclysmic end-Permian mass extinction was immediately followed by a global expansion of microbial ecosystems, as demonstrated by widespread microbialite sequences (disaster facies) in shallow water settings. Here we present high-resolution carbonate carbon ($\delta$13Ccarb) and carbonate-associated sulfate–sulfur isotope ($\delta$34SCAS) records from the microbialite in the Cili Permian–Triassic (P–Tr) section in South China. A stepwise decline in $\delta$13Ccarb begins in the underlying skeletal limestone, predating the main oceanic mass extinction and the first appearance of microbialite, and reaches its nadir in the upper part of the microbialite layer. The corresponding $\delta$34SCAS, in the range of 17.4‰ to 27.4‰, is relatively stable in the underlying skeletal limestone, and increases gradually from 2{\&}{\#}xa0;m below the microbialite rising to a peak at the base of the microbialite. Two episodes of positive and negative shifts occurred within the microbialite layer, and exhibit a remarkable co-variance of sulfur and carbon isotope composition. The large amplitude of the variation in $\delta$34SCAS, as high as 7‰ per 100{\&}{\#}xa0;kiloyears, suggests a small oceanic sulfate reservoir size at this time. Furthermore, the $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$34SCAS records co-vary without phase lag throughout the microbialite interval, implying a marine-driven C cycle in an anoxic ocean with anomalously low oceanic sulfate concentrations. On the basis of a non-steady-state box model, we argue that the oceanic sulfate concentration may have fallen to less than 15{\%}, perhaps as low as 3{\%}, of that in the modern oceans. Low oceanic sulfate concentration likely was the consequence of evaporite deposition and widespread anoxic/sulfidic conditions prior to the main mass extinction. By promoting methanogenesis and a build-up of atmospheric CH4 and CO2, low oceanic sulfate may have intensified global warming, exacerbating the inimical environmental conditions of the latest Permian.},

abstract = {The calcium isotopic compositions (??44Ca) of 30 high-purity nannofossil ooze and chalk and 7 pore fluid samples from ODP Site 807A (Ontong Java Plateau) are used in conjunction with numerical models to determine the equilibrium calcium isotope fractionation factor (??s-f) between calcite and dissolved Ca2+ and the rates of post-depositional recrystallization in deep sea carbonate ooze. The value of ??s-f at equilibrium in the marine sedimentary section is 1.0000 ?? 0.0001, which is significantly different from the value (0.9987 ?? 0.0002) found in laboratory experiments of calcite precipitation and in the formation of biogenic calcite in the surface ocean. We hypothesize that this fractionation factor is relevant to calcite precipitation in any system at equilibrium and that this equilibrium fractionation factor has implications for the mechanisms responsible for Ca isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. We describe a steady state model that offers a unified framework for explaining Ca isotope fractionation across the observed precipitation rate range of ???14 orders of magnitude. The model attributes Ca isotope fractionation to the relative balance between the attachment and detachment fluxes at the calcite crystal surface. This model represents our hypothesis for the mechanism responsible for isotope fractionation during calcite precipitation. The Ca isotope data provide evidence that the bulk rate of calcite recrystallization in freshly-deposited carbonate ooze is 30-40{\%}/Myr, and decreases with age to about 2{\%}/Myr in 2-3 million year old sediment. The recrystallization rates determined from Ca isotopes for Pleistocene sediments are higher than those previously inferred from pore fluid Sr concentration and are consistent with rates derived for Late Pleistocene siliciclastic sediments using uranium isotopes. Combining our results for the equilibrium fractionation factor and recrystallization rates, we evaluate the effect of diagenesis on the Ca isotopic composition of marine carbonates at Site 807A. Since calcite precipitation rates in the sedimentary column are many orders of magnitude slower than laboratory experiments and the pore fluids are only slightly oversaturated with respect to calcite, the isotopic composition of diagenetic calcite is likely to reflect equilibrium precipitation. Accordingly, diagenesis produces a maximum shift in ??44Ca of +0.15??? for Site 807A sediments but will have a larger impact where sedimentation rates are low, seawater circulates through the sediment pile, or there are prolonged depositional hiatuses. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The Ubara section was located in a high-productivity peri-equatorial location, whereas the Gujo-Hachiman section was located in a moderate-productivity location at some distance from the paleoequator. An upward transition from gray organic-poor cherts to black siliceous mudstones at both sites occurred in conjunction with increased primary productivity, intensified euxinia within the oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ), and decimation of the radiolarian zooplankton community. Euxinia in the OMZ of the equatorial Panthalassic Ocean developed episodically for a {\~{}}. 200-250. kyr interval during the Late Permian, followed by an abrupt intensification and lateral expansion of the OMZ around the Permian-Triassic boundary.

abstract = {A high-resolution geochemical record of a 120 cm black shale interval deposited during the Coniacian-Santonian Oceanic Anoxic Event 3 (ODP Leg 207, Site 1261, Demerara Rise) has been constructed to provide detailed insight into rapid changes in deep ocean and sediment paleo-redox conditions. High contents of organic matter, sulfur and redox-sensitive trace metals (Cd, Mo, V, Zn), as well as continuous lamination, point to deposition under consistently oxygen-free and largely sulfidic bottom water conditions. However, rapid and cyclic changes in deep ocean redox are documented by short-term (∼15-20 ka) intervals with decreased total organic carbon (TOC), S and redox-sensitive trace metal contents, and in particular pronounced phosphorus peaks (up to 2.5 wt{\%} P) associated with elevated Fe oxide contents. Sequential iron and phosphate extractions confirm that P is dominantly bound to iron oxides and incorporated into authigenic apatite. Preservation of this Fe-P coupling in an otherwise sulfidic depositional environment (as indicated by Fe speciation and high amounts of sulfurized organic matter) may be unexpected, and provides evidence for temporarily non-sulfidic bottom waters. However, there is no evidence for deposition under oxic conditions. Instead, sulfidic conditions were punctuated by periods of anoxic, non-sulfidic bottom waters. During these periods, phosphate was effectively scavenged during precipitation of iron (oxyhydr)oxides in the upper water column, and was subsequently deposited and largely preserved at the sea floor. After ∼15-25 ka, sulfidic bottom water conditions were re-established, leading to the initial precipitation of CdS, ZnS and pyrite. Subsequently, increasing concentrations of H2S in the water column led to extensive formation of sulfurized organic matter, which effectively scavenged particle-reactive Mo complexes (thiomolybdates). At Site 1261, sulfidic bottom waters lasted for ∼90-100 ka, followed by another period of anoxic, non-sulfidic conditions lasting for ∼15-20 ka. The observed cyclicity at the lower end of the redox scale may have been triggered by repeated incursions of more oxygenated surface- to mid-waters from the South Atlantic resulting in a lowering of the oxic-anoxic chemocline in the water column. Alternatively, sea water sulfate might have been stripped by long-lasting high rates of sulfate reduction, removing the ultimate source for HS- production. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Frasnian-Famennian (F-F) global event, one of the five largest biotic crises of the Phanerozoic, has been inconclusively linked to rapid climatic perturbations promoted in turn by volcanic cataclysm, especially in the Viluy large igneous province (LIP) of Siberia. Conversely, the triggers of four other Phanerozoic mass extinction intervals have decisively been linked to LIPs, owing to documented mercury anomalies, shown as the diagnostic proxy. Here, we report multiple Hg enrichments in the two-step late Frasnian (Kellwasser) crisis interval from paleogeographically distant successions in Morocco, Germany, and northern Russia. The distinguishing signal, {\textgreater}1 ppm Hg in the domain of closing Rheic Ocean, was identified in different lithologies immediately below the F-F boundary and approximately correlated with the onset of the main extinction pulse. This key Hg anomaly, comparable only with an extreme spike known from the end-Ordovician extinction, was not controlled by increased bioproductivity in an anoxic setting. We suggest, therefore, that the global chemostratigraphic pattern near the F-F boundary records a greatly increased worldwide Hg input, controlled by the Center Hill eruptive pulse of the Eovariscan volcanic acme, but likely not manifested exclusively by LIP(s). Consequently, all five major biotic crises of the Phanerozoic have now been more reliably linked to volcanic cataclysms.},

The dominant dynamic is of kinetic isotope discrimination, in which the light isotope of N (14N) is preferentially converted from substrate to product, leaving the substrate relatively enriched in15N. The description of models and of observed N fluxes and pools in the ocean is dominated by two general parameters: (1) the amplitude of the isotope discrimination in a given N conversion, and (2) the degree to which that conversion consumes its substrate.},

@article{Schoepfer2016,
abstract = {The end-Triassic mass extinction has been characterized as a ‘greenhouse extinction', related to rapid atmospheric warming and associated changes in ocean circulation and oxygenation. The response of the marine nitrogen cycle to these oceanographic changes, and the extent to which mass extinction intervals represent a deviation in nitrogen cycling from other ice-free ‘greenhouse' periods of Earth history, remain poorly understood. The well-studied Kennecott Point section in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, Canada, was deposited in the open Panthalassic Ocean, and is used here as a test case to better understand changes in the nitrogen cycle and marine productivity from the pre-crisis greenhouse of the Rhaetian to the latest-Rhaetian crisis interval. We estimated marine productivity from the late Norian to the early Hettangian using TOC- and P-based paleoproductivity transform equations, and then compared these estimates to records of sedimentary nitrogen isotopes, redox-sensitive trace elements, and biomarker data. Major negative excursions in $\delta$15N (to ≤0‰) correspond to periods of depressed marine productivity. During these episodes, the development of a stable pycnocline below the base of the photic zone suppressed vertical mixing and limited N availability in surface waters, leading to low productivity and increased nitrogen fixation, as well as ecological stresses in the photic zone. The subsequent shoaling of euxinic waters into the ocean surface layer was fatal for most Triassic marine fauna, although the introduction of regenerated NH4+into the photic zone may have allowed phytoplankton productivity to recover. These results indicate that the open-ocean nitrogen cycle was influenced by climatic changes during the latest Triassic, despite having existed in a greenhouse state for over 50 million years previously, and that low N availability limited marine productivity for hundreds of thousands of years during the end-Triassic crisis.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction greatly affected the sedimentary record, but the sedimentary response was not limited to the Permian–Triassic boundary interval. This transformation extended to sedimentation that spanned the entire Early Triassic. Calcimicrobialites play an important role throughout this time interval, and at least four main events of anomalous carbonate deposition can be shown. A post-extinction calcimicrobial unit occurs above the extensive Permian skeletal carbonate platform exposed in the Taurus Mountains (southern Turkey), in south Armenia, north-west north and Central Iran along the Zagros Mountains. The calcimicrobial unit formed during the flooding of the platform that took place during the earliest Triassic. A similar calcimicrobialite formed during late Griesbachian to Dienerian time atop the shallow Permian skeletal carbonate platform largely exposed in south China. A third event occurred during the Early Olenekian on the first Mesozoic isolated pelagic plateau (Baid seamount, Oman Mountains). Here the change in carbonate sedimentation is reflected in the occurrence of thrombolites and carbonate seafloor fans. Near the end of Early Triassic time, unusual carbonate deposition is recorded both on an isolated pelagic plateau of the Western Tethys (Halstatt limestone of Dobrogea, Romania) and on the eastern Panthalassa margin of the western United States. In the western United States, the event is represented by stromatolites and thrombolites in the Virgin Limestone of the Moenkopi Formation and by seafloor fans in the middle and upper members of the Union Wash Formation. These unusual episodes of anomalous carbonate deposition illustrate a fundamental change in sedimentation that occurred in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction.},

@article{Michalopoulos2004,
abstract = {Deltaic environments are commonly assumed to be relatively minor sites of biogenic silica burial because of the small quantities of opaline silica detected by most operational analytical techniques. Rapid conversion of biogenic silica into authigenic silicates is also often discounted as a significant control on oceanic silica budgets. A variety of evidence for extensive early diagenetic alteration of biogenic silica in rapidly accumulating Amazon delta sediments indicates that both of these general assumptions are unjustified. Apparent lack of significant biogenic silica storage in deltaic environments, particularly in the tropics, may be largely an artifact of operational definitions that do not include early diagenetic products of biogenic silica. Biogenic silica particles buried in suboxic Amazon delta deposits can be unaltered, partially dissolved, covered with aluminosilicate or metal-rich coatings, or completely reconstituted into authigenic K-Fe-rich aluminosilicate minerals. Pore water (K, Mg, F, Si) and solid-phase distributions, direct observations of particles, laboratory experiments, and depositional context indicate that authigenic clays form rapidly ({\textless}1 yr) in the seasonally reworked surface layer (??? 0.5-2 m) of the delta topset and are disseminated during sediment remobilization. Fe, Al-oxide rich debris derived from the tropical drainage basin is an abundant reactant, and thus the supply of biogenic silica is a major control on the amount of clay formed. The mild 1{\%} Na2CO3 alkaline leach procedure commonly used to estimate biogenic silica was modified to include an initial mild leach step with 0.1N HCl to remove metal oxide coatings and to activate poorly crystalline authigenic phases for alkaline dissolution. Well-crystallized clays are not significantly affected by this modification nor is bulk Amazon River bed sediment. The two-step procedure indicates that ???90{\%} of the biogenic silica originally present in deposits is converted to clay or otherwise altered, raising the effective quantity of biogenic silica stored from ???33 to ???296 ??mol Si g-1 (???1.8{\%} SiO2). Biogenic Si stored in the delta increases away from the river mouth, across shelf and along the dispersal system where primary production is highest. The K/Si ratio of labile authigenic material is ???0.19 mol mol-1, far higher than Amazon River suspended matter (???0.07 mol mol-1). Diagenetic models indicate formation rates in the mobile sediment layer of ???2.8 ??mol K g-1 yr-1 (???16 ??mol Si g-1 yr-1). Inclusion of authigenic alteration products of biogenic silica in estimates of reactive Si burial increases the deltaic storage of riverine Si to ???22{\%} of the Amazon River input. The rapid formation of aluminosilicates from biogenic SiO2, seawater solutes, and remobilized Fe, Al-oxides represents a form of reverse weathering. Rapid reverse weathering reactions in tropical muds and deltaic deposits, the largest sediment depocenters on Earth, confirms the general importance of these processes in oceanic elemental cycles. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recently, a new geochemical temperature proxy, the TEX86, was introduced. This proxy is based on the number of cyclopentane moieties in the glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) of the membrane lipids of marine Crenarchaeota, which changes as a response to temperature. However, until now, only sediment data have been used to establish this proxy, and experimental work is missing. We performed mesocosm studies with marine Crenarchaeota incubated at temperatures ranging from 5 to 35degreesC and salinities of 27 and 35parts per thousand to test the validity of the TEX86 proxy. Growth of marine Crenarchaeota in these mesocosms was evident from the substantial increase in the concentration of marine Crenarchaeotal membrane lipids with amounts up to 3400 ng/L. With increasing temperature, an increase in the number of cyclopentane moieties in the crenarchaeotal membrane lipids was observed. Different salinities did not show any effect on the GDGT distribution. The TEX86 showed a significant linear correlation to incubation temperature: TEX86 = 0.015 x T + 0.10 (r(2) = 0.79). This equation has a similar slope to the correlation obtained from core tops but differs in the intersection (TEX86 = 0.015 x T + 0.28, r(2) = 0.92). This difference is mainly determined by the smaller amount of the regioisomer of crenarchaeol in the incubation series compared to core top samples. These incubation experiments indicates that water temperature is indeed the major controlling factor for the membrane distribution of marine Crenarchaeota and confirms that the TEX86 proxy depends on a physiological response to regulate membrane fluidity.},

Carbon isotope chemostratigraphy comparison allows improved age dating of the Boreal sections and shows a significant hiatus in the upper Spathian. Two major deepening events, in earliest Griesbachian and late Smithian time, are separated by shallowing-upwards trends that culminated in the Dienerian and Spathian substages. The redox record, revealed by changes in bioturbation, palaeoecology, pyrite framboid content and trace metal concentrations, shows anoxic phases alternating with intervals of better ventilation. Only Dienerian–early Smithian time witnessed persistent oxygenation that was sufficient to support a diverse benthic community. The most intensely anoxic, usually euxinic, conditions are best developed in offshore settings, but at times euxinia also developed in upper offshore settings where it is even recorded in hyperpycnite and storm-origin sandstone beds: an extraordinary facet of Spitsbergen's record. The euxinic phases do not track relative water depth changes. For example, the continuous shallowing upwards from the Griesbachian to lower Dienerian was witness to several euxinic phases separated by intervals of more oxic, bioturbated sediments. It is likely that the euxinia was controlled by climatic oscillations rather than intra-basinal factors. It remains to be seen if all the anoxic phases found in Spitsbergen are seen elsewhere, although the wide spread of anoxic facies in the Smithian/Spathian boundary interval is clearly a global event.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The equations for calculating classical confidence intervals on the end points of stratigraphic ranges are based on the restrictive assumption of randomly distributed fossil finds. Herein, a method is presented for calculating confidence intervals on the end-points of stratigraphic ranges that partially relaxes this assumption: the method will work for any continuous distribution of gap sizes, not just those generated by random processes. The price paid for the generality of the new approach is twofold: (1) there are uncertainties associated with the sizes of the confidence intervals, and (2) for large confidence values (e.g., 95{\%}) a rich fossil record is required to place upper bounds on the corresponding confidence intervals. This new method is not universal; like the method for calculating classical confidence intervals it is based on the assumption that there is no correlation between gap size and stratigraphic position. The fossil record of the Neogene Caribbean bryozoan Metrarabdotos is analyzed with the new approach. The equations developed here, like those for classical confidence intervals, should not be applied to stratigraphic ranges based on discrete sampling regimes, such as those typically established from deep-sea drilling cores, though there are exceptions to this rule.

abstract = {The European continental plate drifted northwards in Late Triassic to Early Jurassic time. The change in plate position gave rise to a long-term shift from arid/semi-arid to humid climate in the North Sea region, in addition to a global warming effect of the igneous activity in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province. In the Tampen Spur area in the northern North Sea, this climatic change profoundly influenced the development of alluvial successions represented by the Lunde Formation (Norian-early Rhaetian) and the overlying Raude and Eiriksson formations (Rhaetian-Hettangian) in the Statfjord Group. Arid to semi-arid climate during the Norian and early Rhaetian is expressed in the lower part of the Lunde Formation by ephemeral braided stream sandstones, reddish-brown entisols/inceptisols and floodplain mudstones characterised by diverse clay mineral suites and high feldspar contents. A change towards semi-humid climate in the late Rhaetian is reflected in the upper part of the Lunde Formation by fluvial sandstones representing meandering rivers, moderately developed cumulative vertisols and higher contents of smectite and kaolinite resulting from increased chemical weathering. Increased production of clays in the hinterland, lowered relief and decreased rate of sediment supply gave rise to a fining-upward trend with an increasing degree of palaeosol development in the upper part of the Lunde Formation and the lowermost part of the Statfjord Group. Increasing humidity during the latest Rhaetian and Hettangian is witnessed in the lower part of the Statfjord Group by a change from reddish-brown to greenish-grey colour in mudstones, disappearance of calcrete nodules and smectite as the dominating clay mineral formed on wet floodplains. Quartz-arenitic braided stream sandstones and kaolinite-dominated floodplain mudstones in the upper part of the Statfjord Group reveal that humid and warm climate conditions prevailed, with intense chemical weathering in the hinterland. Monsoonal rainfall gave high surface runoff, producing sediment-laden discharge within well-drained alluvial fans or plains. Coupled with low accommodation space, this resulted in a coarsening-upwards trend in the Statfjord Group, braided-stream sandstones with wide lateral extent and floodplain mudstones with palaeosols reflecting highly varying degrees of pedogenic alteration. Allostratigraphic units in the Lunde Formation and the Statfjord Group may have formed in response to more high-frequency climatic cycles or base-level changes. � 2014 by International Association of Sedimentologists.

abstract = {Collectively, marine sediments comprise the largest reservoir of methane on Earth. The flux of methane from the sea bed to the overlying water column is mitigated by the sulphate-dependent anaerobic oxidation of methane by marine microbes within a discrete sedimentary horizon termed the sulphate-methane transition zone. According to conventional isotope systematics, the biological consumption of methane leaves a residue of methane enriched in 13 C (refs). However, in many instances the methane within sulphate-methane transition zones is depleted in 13 C, consistent with the production of methane, and interpreted as evidence for the intertwined anaerobic oxidation and production of methane. Here, we report results from experiments in which we incubated cultures of microbial methane consumers with methane and low levels of sulphate, and monitored the stable isotope composition of the methane and dissolved inorganic carbon pools over time. Residual methane became progressively enriched in 13 C at sulphate concentrations above 0.5 mM, and progressively depleted in 13 C below this threshold. We attribute the shift to 13 C depletion during the anaerobic oxidation of methane at low sulphate concentrations to the microbially mediated carbon isotope equilibration between methane and carbon dioxide. We suggest that this isotopic effect could help to explain the 13 C-depletion of methane in subseafloor sulphate-methane transition zones. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

End-Permian catastrophe by a bolide impact: evidence of a gigantic release of sulfur from the mantle. Geology 29, 815-818] based on a negative shift of S-34/S-32 ratio of carbonate-associated sulfate in South China. This hypothesis was discussed in some papers with additional data in other areas. However, the cause and distribution of the negative shift has not been clarified. Here we show that a significant decrease in the S-34/S-32 ratio of carbonate-associated sulfate occurred simultaneously in South China and Hungary at the end of the Permian, coincident with the end-Permian mass extinction. The cause of the abrupt negative shift of S-34/S-32 in these two distant sites is the injection of light sulfur to the surface ocean from the deep ocean rich in H2S, or deposits rich in sulfide, or the mantle. This sulfur isotope event was likely caused by either an abrupt warming, a bolide impact to the ocean, mantle plume-induced volcanism, or a harmonizing of these. Possible direct causes are (1) massive release of H2S gas from the euxinic surface and intermediate waters due to abrupt warming by volcanic CO2 or impact shock wave in the ocean, (2) a huge volcanisin penetrated sediments or ore rich in sulfide (3) an extraterrestrial impact to sulfide-rich sediments or ore deposit, and (4) release of mantle origin sulfur by an impact of {\textgreater} 70 km asteroid to the ocean. These are four possible causes for a mass extinction. There is also a possibility of a local oceanic event, only in the Tethys. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Three dissolution techniques (buffered dithionite, cold 1 M HCl, boiling 12 M HCl) were examined for their capacity to extract iron from a variety of iron minerals, and iron-bearing sediments, as a function of different extraction times and different grain sizes. All the iron oxides studied are quantitatively extracted by dithionite and boiling HCl (but not by cold HCl). Both HCl techniques extract more iron from silicates than does dithionite but probably about the same amounts as are potentially capable of sulphidation. Modern sediment studies indicate that most sedimentary pyrite is formed rapidly from iron oxides, with smaller amounts formed more slowly from iron silicates (if sufficient geologic time is available). It is therefore recommended that the degree of pyritisation be defined with respect to the dithionite-extractable (mainly iron oxide) pool and/or the boiling HCl-extractable pool (which includes some silicate iron) for the recognition of iron-limited pyritisation. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

The philosopher A. N. Whitehead (1942) expressed the urgency and the dangers of the need to understand when he wrote, ``Our reasonings grasp at straws for premises and float on gossamers for deductions.'' Less charitably, R. Crawshay-Williams (1947) wrote of the ``Comforts of Unreason,'' noting our tendency to prefer those hypotheses that provide us with the contentment of easily grasped and usable explanations. The fragility of the foundations on which we have based our theories over the last few decades has become apparent as we have sought revelation in various diagenetic environments, first the meteoric, then the open-system marine, later the deep-burial and now the closed-system marine.

To properly appreciate the history of tectonics - and its influence on the deep Earth and climate - it is imperative to seek an accurate and global model of paleogeography. However, owing to the incessant loss of oceanic lithosphere through subduction, the paleogeographic reconstruction of 'full-plates' (including oceanic lithosphere) becomes increasingly challenging with age. Prior to 150 Ma ???60{\%} of the lithosphere is missing and reconstructions are developed without explicit regard for oceanic lithosphere or plate tectonic principles; in effect, reflecting the earlier mobilistic paradigm of continental drift. Although these 'continental' reconstructions have been immensely useful, the next-generation of mantle models requires global plate kinematic descriptions with full-plate reconstructions. Moreover, in disregarding (or only loosely applying) plate tectonic rules, continental reconstructions fail to take advantage of a wealth of additional information in the form of practical constraints. Following a series of new developments, both in geodynamic theory and analytical tools, it is now feasible to construct full-plate models that lend themselves to testing by the wider Earth-science community. Such a model is presented here for the late Paleozoic (410-250 Ma) together with a review of the underlying data. Although we expect this model to be particularly useful for numerical mantle modeling, we hope that it will also serve as a general framework for understanding late Paleozoic tectonics, one on which future improvements can be built and further tested. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The duration of early Triassic anoxia in the carbonate ramp settings of the Werfen Formation (Dolomites, northern Italy) has been constrained using ichnofabric and sedimentological data. This includes fine lamination and abundant pyrite framboids commonly reworked into lags by storm events. The ''anoxic'' event spanned the entire Griesbachian Stage and extended from deep waters into extraordinarily shallow water settings; evidence for oxygen deficiency can be found in mid and inner ramp facies. The extent and duration of this event may at least partially explain the magnitude of the Permo-Triassic mass extinction. Normal benthic conditions returned rapidly in the Dienerian Stage and pervasively bioturbated distal ramp facies testify to the ventilation of the deeper water areas of the region in post-Griesbachian times. A post-mass extinction radiation is not particularly well displayed in either trace fossil or body fossil diversity compilations from the Dolomites. Moderate/low levels of trace fossil diversity are maintained throughout the post-Griesbachian Werfen Formation whilst the body fossil data shows a moderate increase from the mid-Smithian Stage. There is thus a curious lag period spanning the Dienerian to mid-Smithian when environmental conditions were apparently normal but the marine fauna failed to show any recovery.},

POM (particulate organic matter) collected at oxic/anoxic interfaces in the water column showed no distinctive carbon or nitrogen isotopic compositions that could be associated with chemosynthetic bacteria. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions at POM concentration maxima near the top of the sulfide zone were −23{\%}o and 4.5{\%}o, respectively, in both the Black Sea and the Cariaco Trench. Measurements of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the Black Sea indicated that carbon respired during decomposition at depth had an isotopic composition of −23{\%}o and was isotopically similar to phytoplankton, with no distinctive component that could be attributed to chemosynthetic carbon. These results indicate that either the biomass of chemosynthetic bacteria in the oxic/anoxic interface zones is low relative to sinking phytoplankton or that chemoautotrophic bacteria have isotopic compositions similar to those of phytoplankton.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nIn the uppermost 50 m of sulfidic waters in the Black Sea, sulfide isotopic compositions changed significantly in a region of sulfide consumption, increasing up to 5{\%}o vs deep-water background values of −40.5{\%}o. These increases in sulfide isotopic compositions may be due to sulfide oxidation mediated by MnO2 or oxygen, but are not consistent with sulfide oxidation by photosynthetic bacteria. Growth experiments with sulfate-reducing bacteria suggested that part of the increase in sulfide isotopic compositions could be due to rapid rates of sulfate reduction in the oxic/anoxic interface regions.},

Ionic interaction approach: Theory and data correlation. In: K.S. Pitzer (Editor), 2nd Edition, Activity Coefficients in Electrolyte Solutions. CRC Press, Roca Raton Ann Arbor Boston London, pp. 75-153.]. Dissociation pressures are calculated for different temperature and salinity conditions ranging from 273 to 293 K and 0-70 (salinity). The solubility of methane and methane hydrate in seawater is calculated for the same temperature and salinity ranges and for hydrostatic pressures (Pdis) up to 50 MPa. Since the composition of major pore water ions may change due to a variety of geochemical processes (i.e. anaerobic oxidation of organic matter or/and methane) affecting the activity of water, additional stability and solubility calculations are presented by substituting the equivalent amount of sulfate by hydrogen carbonate ions. Based on this rigorous thermodynamic analysis, the calculation of dissociation pressures has been approximated by empirical algorithms that are functions of temperature and salinity (chlorinity for pore water). Similar algorithms are presented for the calculation of methane concentrations in seawater and pore water equilibrated with methane hydrate as functions of salinity (chlorinity for pore water), temperature and hydrostatic pressure. In contrast to earlier approaches, the provided methods allow the calculation of these properties by easily applicable functions considering a continuous variation of the control parameters over a wide range of conditions that are met in the deep marine environment. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The boron isotope composition of marine carbonates such as foraminiferal tests and coral skeletons is increasingly being used to reconstruct seawater pH values and atmospheric pCO2 concentrations spanning hundreds of thousands or even millions of years. However, inter specific and small scale (microns) intra specific isotopic variation, either due to life processes of an organism or patchy recrystallisation and dissolution in fossilised material, can limit the use of the boron isotope ratio as palaeo-pH recorder. One approach to address this problem is the combined use of in situ and high spatial resolution mass spectrometry and high precision bulk analytical techniques. While much effort has been invested to establish reference material for silicates little attention has been devoted towards characterizing and using carbonate material allowing direct isotopic comparisons between B isotope data produced on carbonates by different techniques and laboratories. Hence, here we present data on the boron isotope composition of carbonate material determined by multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS), thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), and secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS). The new reference material permits the B isotope analysis of single foraminiferal chambers using SIMS and to empirically relate between seawater pH, the B isotope composition of O. universa and the predicted foraminiferal vital effect. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Through a repeated cycle of sulfide oxidation to S0 and subsequent disproportionation, these bacteria can deplete sedimentary sulfides in sulfur-34. A prediction, borne out by observation, is that more extensive sulfide oxidation will lead to sulfides that are more depleted in sulfur-34. Thus, the oxidative part of the sulfur cycle creates circumstances by which sulfides become more depleted in sulfur-34 than would be possible with sulfate-reducing bacteria alone.},

State-of-the-art sampling completeness metrics, counting protocols, and sampling standardisation functions permit the reconstruction of biologically meaningful time series. Additional functions permit the partitioning of turnover rates by trait and environmental affinity. We display Phanerozoic-scale diversity dynamics of marine invertebrates using the divDyn package.

abstract = {We have determined (1) the abundance and isotopic composition of pyrite, monosulphide, elemental sulphur, organically bound sulphur, and dissolved sulphide; (2) the partition of ferric and ferrous iron; (3) the organic carbon contents of sediments recovered at two sites drilled on the Peru Margin during Leg 112 of the Ocean Drilling Program. Sediments at both sites are characterised by high levels of organically bound sulphur (OBS). OBS comprises up to 50{\%} of total sedimentary sulphur and up to 1{\%} of bulk sediment. The weight ratio of S to C in organic matter varies from 0.03 to 0.15 (mean = 0.10). Such ratios are like those measured in lithologically similar, but more deeply buried petroleum source rocks of the Monterey and Sisquoc formations in California. The sulphur content of organic matter is not limited by the availability of porewater sulphide. Isotopic data suggest that sulphur is incorporated into organic matter within a metre of the sediment surface, at least partly by reaction with polysulphides.  Most inorganic Sulphur occurs as pyrite. Pyrite formation occurred within surface sediments and was limited by the availability of reactive iron. But despite highly reducing sulphidic conditions, only 35–65{\%} of the total iron was converted to sulphide; 10–30{\%} of the total iron still occurs as Fe (III). In surface sediments, the isotopic composition of pyrite is similar to that of both iron monosulphide and dissolved sulphide. Either pyrite, like monosulphide, formed by direct reaction between dissolved sulphide and detrital iron, and/or the Sulphur species responsible for converting FeS to FeS2 is isotopically similar to dissolved sulphide. Likely stoichiometries for the reaction between ferric iron and excess sulphide imply a maximum resulting FeS2 :FeS ratio of 1:1. Where pyrite dominates the pool of iron sulphides, at least some pyrite must have formed by reaction between monosulphide and elemental sulphur and/or polysulphide. Elemental sulphur (S0) is most abundant in surface sediments and probably formed by oxidation of sulphide diffusing across the sediment-water interface. In surface sediments, S0 is isotopically heavier than dissolved sulphide, FeS and FeS2 and is unlikely to have been involved in the conversion of FeS to FeS2. Polysulphides are thus implicated as the link between FeS and FeS2.},

The effects of the presence of a concentration boundary layer (CBL), light limitations, and activity corrections are included in the analysis. Results of the model establish that the phosphate buffer, the presence of a CBL, and light limitations have a significant impact on the predicted flux of inorganic carbon into algal biofilms, whereas the effects of background ions, activity corrections, and algal surface charges can be neglected.},

abstract = {A sequential extraction method (BASEX) was developed to determine the different Ba fractions in sediments. Calibration of BASEX with pure barite and a home-made mixed mineral standard showed that barite is separated from all other major Ba containing mineral phases, such as clay minerals and Fe and Mn oxides. This method permits the direct determination of sedimentary barite content and of the Ba/Al ratio of clay, and is, therefore, a useful tool in palaeoclimatic studies. Application of BASEX to eastern Mediterranean sediments, including sapropel S1, revealed that the enrichment in Ba concentrations observed in this sapropel consists predominantly of barite. The relationship of barite-Ba with organic carbon in sapropel S1 sediments appears to be independent of water depth, of organic matter fluxes and of the sedimentation rate for cores ranging from 2150 to 3300 m water depth. Apparently, organic carbon remineralisation has been virtually absent in the water column deeper than 2150 m. This might have been caused by suboxic to anoxic conditions present in the deep eastern Mediterranean basin during the formation of sapropel S1. Because of the constant relationship between barite and organic carbon in sapropelic sediments, we suggest that the barite content can be used to quantify the initial organic carbon content of the sediment in the oxidised sapropel interval. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, it is not always clear how exactly biomarkers reflect a paleoecosystem as their preservation may be influenced by increasing temperatures (T) and pressures (P) during burial. While a number of biomarker indices reflecting thermal maturity have been established, it is often less well constrained to which extent biomarker ratios used for paleoreconstruction are compromised by T and P processes. In this study we conducted hydrous pyrolysis of Green River Shale (GRS) kerogen in gold capsules for 2–2400 h at 300°C to assess the maturation behaviour of several compounds used as life tracers and for the reconstruction of paleoenvironments ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -alkanes, pristane, phytane, gammacerane, steranes, hopanes and cheilanthanes). Lignite samples were maturated in parallel with the GRS kerogen to obtain exact vitrinite reflectance data at every sampling point. Our experiment confirms the applicability of biomarker-based indices and ratios as maturity indicators (e.g. total cheilanthanes/hopanes ratio; sterane and hopane isomerization indices). However, several biomarker ratios that are commonly used for paleoreconstructions (e.g. pristane/phytane, pristane/ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -C {\textless}sub{\textgreater}17{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} , phytane/ {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -C {\textless}sub{\textgreater}18{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and total steranes/hopanes) were considerably affected by differences in the thermal degradation behaviour of the respective compounds. Short-term experiments (48 h) performed at 400°C also revealed that biomarkers {\&}gt;C {\textless}sub{\textgreater}15{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} (especially steranes and hopanes) and ‘biological' chain length preferences for {\textless}italic{\textgreater}n{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -alkanes are vanished at a vitrinite reflectance between 1.38 and 1.83{\%} {\textless}italic{\textgreater}R{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}O{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} . Our data highlight that ‘thermal taphonomy' effects have to be carefully considered in the interpretation of biomarkers in ancient rocks and, potentially, extraterrestrial materials. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Nitrogen compounds in the interbedded turbiditic/pelagic sediments of the Madeira Abyssal Plain (from hereon MAP) have been divided in separate extracted fractions such as 'exchangeable nitrogen' (N(ex)), 'fixed nitrogen' (N(fix)) and 'organic nitrogen' (N(org)). N(ex) is found to be directly proportional to the amount of organic matter (C(org)) in the sediment and is not related to the amount of ammonium in the porewater. Only at a relatively low C(org) content is the N(ex) determined by the mineralogy of the sediment. The N(org) as determined from N(org) = (N(tot) - N(fix) - N(ex)) is strongly related with C(org). The N(fix) content and the N(fix)/Al ratio for organic-rich sediments are high compared with other sediments and have not changed upon post-depositional oxidation of the organic matter. Post-depositional oxidation of organic matter through oxygen does lead to a decrease in the C/N ratio of the remaining organic matter in the organic-rich turbidites. The C/N ratio calculated for the organic matter that has been decomposed through oxygen is similar to that calculated through stoichiometric modelling for decomposition under reducing circumstances (C/N ratios of almost-equal-to 17 and almost-equal-to 18, respectively). This implies that for the sediments of the MAP, the C/N ratio is identical for organic matter decomposed under oxygenated and under reducing conditions.},

abstract = {A sparse geological record combined with physics and molecular phylogeny constrains the environmental conditions on the early Earth. The Earth began hot after the moon-forming impact and cooled to the point where liquid water was present in approximately 10 million years. Subsequently, a few asteroid impacts may have briefly heated surface environments, leaving only thermophile survivors in kilometer-deep rocks. A warm 500 K, 100 bar CO(2) greenhouse persisted until subducted oceanic crust sequestered CO(2) into the mantle. It is not known whether the Earth's surface lingered in a approximately 70 degrees C thermophile environment well into the Archaean or cooled to clement or freezing conditions in the Hadean. Recently discovered approximately 4.3 Ga rocks near Hudson Bay may have formed during the warm greenhouse. Alkalic rocks in India indicate carbonate subduction by 4.26 Ga. The presence of 3.8 Ga black shales in Greenland indicates that S-based photosynthesis had evolved in the oceans and likely Fe-based photosynthesis and efficient chemical weathering on land. Overall, mantle derived rocks, especially kimberlites and similar CO(2)-rich magmas, preserve evidence of subducted upper oceanic crust, ancient surface environments, and biosignatures of photosynthesis.},

abstract = {Ikaite (CaCO3{\textperiodcentered}6H2O) forms submarine tufa columns in Ikka Fjord, SW Greenland. This unique occurrence is thought to relate to aqueous phosphate concentration and low water temperatures ({\textless}6 °C). Phosphate ions are well-known inhibitors of calcite precipitation and Ikka Fjord has a naturally high-phosphate groundwater system that when mixing with seawater leads to the precipitation of ikaite. In the study presented here, experiments simulating conditions of Ikka Fjord show that a) the formation of ikaite is unrelated to the aqueous phosphate concentration (0–263 $\mu$mol/kg PO43−) in 0.1 M NaHCO3/0.1 M Na2CO3 solutions mixing with seawater at 5 °C and pH 9.6–10.6, and b) ikaite forms at temperatures up to 15 °C without phosphate and in open beakers exposed to air. Instead, supersaturation of ikaite and the seawater composition are the likely factors causing ikaite to precipitate in Ikka Fjord. This study shows that adding Mg2+ to a NaHCO3/Na2CO3 – CaCl2 mixed solution leads to the formation of ikaite along with hydrated Mg carbonates, which points to the high Mg2+ concentration of seawater, another known inhibitor of calcite, as a key factor promoting ikaite formation. In experiments at 10 and 15 °C, increasing amounts of either nesquehonite (Mg(HCO3)(OH){\textperiodcentered}2H2O) or an amorphous phase co-precipitate with ikaite. At 20 °C, only the amorphous phase is formed. In warming Arctic seawater, this suggests Mg carbonate precipitation could become dominant over ikaite in the future.},

abstract = {Abstract: Pyrite framboids were found in the Permian-Triassic boundary at Meishan Section, while their sulfur isotopes were determined. The majority of framboids is less than 5 $\mu$m in diameter, with some large-sized framboids. Also, euhedral gypsums were observed in the boundary clay. The authors suppose that most of the pyrite framboids formed just below the redox boundary and stopped growing after entering the lower water column. The result indicates that it was probably lower dysoxia condition in the temporal ocean. Moreover, the authors also presume that some pyrite was oxidated to sulfates accompanying the fluctuation of redox condition, which would probably be the origin of the negative sulfur isotopes of gypsum and CAS reported before. In addition, sulfur isotope of framboidal pyrite suggests that sulfur is originated from bacterial sulfate reduction in anoxic condition. Therefore, this study confirms that the ocean was widely anoxic during the Permian-Triassic transitional period. However, the redox condition in temporal ocean was probably not stable, with short-term fluctuations.},

abstract = {The nitrogen isotopic composition of time-series sediment trap samples, dissolved NO3- and surficial sediments was determined in three regions along the margin of the eastern North Pacific: Monterey Bay, San Pedro Basin, and the Gulf of California (Carmen and Guaymas Basins). Complex physical regimes are present in all three areas, and each is influenced seasonally by coastal upwelling. Nevertheless, sediment trap material evidently records the isotopic composition of new nitrogen sources, since average delta(15)N is generally indistinguishable from delta(15)N values for subsurface NO3-. Surficial sediments are also very similar to the average delta(15)N value of the sediment traps, being within 1 parts per thousand. This difference in delta(15)N between trap material and sediment is much less than the previously observed 4 parts per thousand, difference for the deep sea. Better organic matter preservation at our margin sites is a likely explanation, which may be due to either low bottom O-2 concentrations or higher organic matter input to the sediments. All sites have delta(15)N for sub-euphotic zone NO3- (8-10 parts per thousand) substantially elevated from the oceanic average (4.5-5 parts per thousand). This isotopic enrichment is a result of denitrification in suboxic subsurface waters (Gulf of California) or northward transport of denitrification influenced water (Monterey Bay and San Pedro Basin). Our results therefore suggest that downcore delta(15)N data, depending on site location, would record the intensity of denitrification and the transport of its isotopic signature along the California margin. Temporal variations in delta(15)N for the sediment traps do appear to respond to upwelling or convective injections of NO3- to surface waters as a result of isotopic fractionation during phytoplankton uptake. Overall, though, the coupling between NO3- injection, delta(15)N, and flux is looser than previously observed for the open-ocean, most likely the result of the smaller time/space scales of the events. III the Gulf of California, wintertime convective mixing/upwelling does produce distinct delta(15)N minima co-occurring with particle flux maxima. Interannual variations are apparent in this region when these wintertime delta(15)N minima fail to occur during El Nino conditions. There appears to be a positive relationship between the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly and annual average delta(15)N. One explanation calls for hydrographic changes altering the delta(15)N of subeuphotic zone NO3-. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The correlation between large igneous provinces (LIPs), extinction events, and rapid climate change suggests that volcanism can have a detrimental impact on Earth surface conditions. Changes in atmospheric and ocean chemistry, particularly the climate-sensitive carbon and sulphur cycles, are among the most probable processes for inducing global environmental stress. However, the interactions and feedbacks between volcanism and these cycles are numerous and complex, making the characterisation of the response to a LIP challenging. Here we summarise the sources and sinks of carbon and sulphur from large scale volcanism and magmatism using information from modern and ancient systems. For the sources, we review the current understanding of volcanic emissions, and explore the relative contributions and importance of magma-derived degassing versus volatile release from sediments affected by igneous intrusions and lava. In addition, we explore the various ways in which LIPs can reduce atmospheric concentrations of these same elements. The relative influences of each source and sink are in part determined by the mode of LIP emplacement and eruption style, along with the subsequent timescales of such effects. We focus on a few key examples, including the Siberian Traps, the Paran{\'{a}}-Etendeka, and the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), to demonstrate how the environmental impact can vary considerably with differing modes of emplacement, LIP duration, and eruption styles. In particular, we show that the host rocks can have a dominant role as a source or sink of emissions, depending on the lithologies affected by the LIP emplacement.},

Representative samples from these groups were selected from the Marcellus and Hushpuckney shales and subjected to a multi-step leaching procedure, to isolate four extractable P-phases (reducible, authigenic carbonate-associated, detrital apatite, organic). In Group 1 samples with low carbonate content ({\textless} 4{\%} CaCO3), REEs were hosted mainly in the organic (50{\%} of $\Sigma$REE) and siliciclastic fractions (37{\%}); whereas in samples with greater carbonate content ({\textgreater} 25{\%} CaCO3), REEs were hosted mainly in carbonate-associated phases (53{\%}). In Group 2, REEs were hosted mainly in the carbonate-associated (64{\%}) and organic fractions (30{\%}), and in Group 3, REEs were hosted mainly in the carbonate-associated (60{\%}), detrital apatite (23{\%}), and siliciclastic fractions (16{\%}). Authigenic phases include minerals such as carbonate fluorapatite and authigenic calcite that, if present, tend to dominate the whole-rock REE inventory.

abstract = {A longstanding question in paleontology has been the influence of calcite and aragonite seas on the evolution of carbonate skeletons. An earlier study based on 21 taxa that evolved skeletons during the Ediacaran through Ordovician suggested that carbonate skeletal mineralogy is determined by seawater chemistry at the time skeletons first evolve in a clade. Here I test this hypothesis using an expanded dataset comprising 40 well-defined animal taxa that evolved skeletons de novo in the last 600 Myr. Of the 37 taxa whose mineralogy is known with some confidence, 25 acquired mineralogies that matched seawater chemistry of the time, whereas only two taxa acquired non-matching mineralogies. (Ten appeared during times when seawater chemistry is not well constrained.) The results suggest that calcite and aragonite seas do have a strong influence on carbonate skeletal mineralogy, however, this appears to be true only at the time mineralized skeletons first evolve. Few taxa switch mineralogies (from calcite to aragonite or vice versa) despite subsequent changes in seawater chemistry, and those that do switch do not appear to do so in response to changing aragonite-calcite seas. This suggests that there may be evolutionary constraints on skeletal mineralogy, and that although there may be increased costs associated with producing a mineralogy not favored by seawater, the costs of switching mineralogies are even greater.},

abstract = {The latest Permian mass extinction, the most severe Phanerozoic biotic crisis, is marked by dramatic changes in palaeoenvironments. These changes significantly disrupted the global carbon cycle, reflected by a prominent and well known negative carbon isotope excursion recorded in marine and continental sediments. Carbon isotope trends of bulk carbonate and bulk organic matter in marine deposits of the European Southern Alps near the low-latitude marine event horizon deviate from each other. A positive excursion of several per mil in $\delta$13Corg starts earlier and is much more pronounced than the short-term positive $\delta$13Ccarb excursion; both excursions interrupt the general negative trend. Throughout the entire period investigated, $\delta$13Corg values become lighter with increasing distance from the palaeocoastline. Changing $\delta$13Corg values may be due to the influx of comparatively isotopically heavy land plant material. The stronger influence of land plant material on the $\delta$13Corg during the positive isotope excursion indicates a temporarily enhanced continental runoff that may either reflect increased precipitation, possibly triggered by aerosols originating from Siberian Trap volcanism, or indicate higher erosion rate in the face of reduced land vegetation cover.},

abstract = {A leading hypothesis explaining Phanerozoic mass extinctions and associated carbon isotopic anomalies is the emission of greenhouse, other gases, and aerosols caused by eruptions of continental flood basalt provinces. However, the necessary serial relationship between these eruptions, isotopic excursions, and extinctions has never been tested in geological sections preserving all three records. The end-Triassic extinction (ETE) at 201.4 Ma is among the largest of these extinctions and is tied to a large negative carbon isotope excursion, reflecting perturbations of the carbon cycle including a transient increase in CO(2). The cause of the ETE has been inferred to be the eruption of the giant Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP). Here, we show that carbon isotopes of leaf wax derived lipids (n-alkanes), wood, and total organic carbon from two orbitally paced lacustrine sections interbedded with the CAMP in eastern North America show similar excursions to those seen in the mostly marine St. Audrie's Bay section in England. Based on these results, the ETE began synchronously in marine and terrestrial environments slightly before the oldest basalts in eastern North America but simultaneous with the eruption of the oldest flows in Morocco, a CO(2) super greenhouse, and marine biocalcification crisis. Because the temporal relationship between CAMP eruptions, mass extinction, and the carbon isotopic excursions are shown in the same place, this is the strongest case for a volcanic cause of a mass extinction to date.},

Consequently, controls underlying the size spectrum of the global biota have been difficult to evaluate. Our period-level compilation of the largest known fossil organisms demonstrates that maximum size increased by 16 orders of magnitude since life first appeared in the fossil record. The great majority of the increase is accounted for by 2 discrete steps of approximately equal magnitude: the first in the middle of the Paleoproterozoic Era (approximately 1.9 Gya) and the second during the late Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic eras (0.6-0.45 Gya). Each size step required a major innovation in organismal complexity--first the eukaryotic cell and later eukaryotic multicellularity. These size steps coincide with, or slightly postdate, increases in the concentration of atmospheric oxygen, suggesting latent evolutionary potential was realized soon after environmental limitations were removed.},

We observed seawater that is undersaturated with respect to aragonite upwelling onto large portions of the continental shelf, reaching depths of approximately 40 to 120 meters along most transect lines and all the way to the surface on one transect off northern California. Although seasonal upwelling of the undersaturated waters onto the shelf is a natural phenomenon in this region, the ocean uptake of anthropogenic CO2 has increased the areal extent of the affected area.},

abstract = {DSDP/ODP porewater profiles in organic carbon-bearing ({\textless}5{\%} org. C) sediments commonly show decreases in Ca2+ concentrations and increases in alkalinity over depths where sulphate is being removed by microbial reduction. These Ca2+ depletion profiles represent the combined effect of diffusion, advection and reaction (addition by ion exchange and removal by precipitation mainly as CaCO 3 and/or dolomite). A diagenetic model has been used to estimate the rate constant (k) for Ca2+ removal by precipitation during sulphate depletion over depths of 15-50 m, assuming first order kinetics. The rate constants for Ca2+ removal range from 10-14 to 10-11 s-1 in 19 DSDP/ODP sediments, which span a range of bottom water temperatures (0-10 °C), lithologies (calcareous to clastic) and sedimentation rates (0.00-10.4 cm year-1). Values of k correlate with sedimentation rate ($\omega$) such that log k=1.16 log $\omega$-10.3, indicating that faster rates of Ca2+ removal occur at higher sedimentation rates where there are also higher degrees of saturation with respect to CaCO3 and dolomite. Depth-integrated masses of Ca2+ removed ({\textless}100 $\mu$mol cm2+) during sulphate depletion over these depth ranges are equivalent to a dispersed phase of approximately 1.5 wt.{\%} CaCO 3 or 3 wt.{\%} dolomite in a compacted sediment. The complete occlusion of sediment porosity observed in concretions with isotopic signatures suggesting carbonate sourced from sulphate reduction therefore requires more time (a depositional hiatus), more rapid sulphate reduction (possibly by anaerobic methane oxidation) and/or the continued transport of isotopically light carbonate to the concretion site after sulphate reduction has ceased. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Quantitative tools for deciphering the environment of microbialite formation are relatively limited. For example, the oxygen isotope carbonate-water geothermometer requires assumptions about the isotopic composition of the water of formation. We explored the utility of using 'clumped' isotope thermometry as a tool to study the temperatures of microbialite formation. We studied microbialites recovered from water depths of 10-55 m in Pavilion Lake, and 10-25 m in Kelly Lake, spanning the thermocline in both lakes. We determined the temperature of carbonate growth and the (18) O/(16) O ratio of the waters that microbialites grew in. Results were then compared to current limnological data from the lakes to reconstruct the history of microbialite formation. Modern microbialites collected at shallow depths (11.7 m) in both lakes yield clumped isotope-based temperatures of formation that are within error of summer water temperatures, suggesting that clumped isotope analyses may be used to reconstruct past climates and to probe the environments in which microbialites formed. The deepest microbialites (21.7-55 m) were recovered from below the present-day thermoclines in both lakes and yield radioisotope ages indicating they primarily formed earlier in the Holocene. During this time, pollen data and our reconstructed water (18) O/(16) O ratios indicate a period of aridity, with lower lake levels. At present, there is a close association between both photosynthetic and heterotrophic communities, and carbonate precipitation/microbialite formation, with biosignatures of photosynthetic influences on carbonate detected in microbialites from the photic zone and above the thermocline (i.e., depths of generally {\textless}20 m). Given the deeper microbialites are receiving {\textless}1{\%} of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it is likely these microbialites primarily formed when lower lake levels resulted in microbialites being located higher in the photic zone, in warm surface waters.},

Although the flux rates of all the elements depend on physical erosion, which is mainly controlled by the extent of vegetation coverage in central Africa, element/Al ratios reflect conditions for chemical weathering in the river basin. Maximum sediment input to the ocean occurs during cold and and periods, when precipitation intensity and associated freshwater runoff are reduced. High carbonate contents during the same periods indicate that the sediment supply has a positive effect on river-induced marine productivity In general, variations in the terrestrial signals contain a strong precessional component in tune with changes in low-latitude solar radiation. However, the terrestrial signal lags the insolation signal by several thousand years. K/Al, Ti/Al, and Zr/Al records reveal that African monsoonal precipitation depends on high-latitude forcing. We attribute the shift between insolation cycle and river discharge to the frequently reported nonlinear response of African climate to primary orbital configurations, which may be caused by a complex interaction of the secondary control parameters, such as surface albedo and/or thermohaline circulation.

abstract = {The Triassic–Jurassic boundary interval was characterised by the change from warm, semiarid–arid to a hot and humid climate in the Tethyan domain linked to input of greenhouse gases from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) activity and Pangaea breakup. This study provides the very first outcrop evidences of palaeoclimatic evolution during the Triassic–Jurassic boundary interval in the then southern hemisphere, along the eastern margin of Gondwana facing the western Tethys. In the Tethyan Salt Range of Pakistan a succession of Upper Triassic dolomites, green-black shales (Kingriali Formation) to overlying Lower Jurassic quartzose sandstones, shales, laterites and conglomerates (Datta Formation) represents the sedimentary archives of this critical time interval. Bulk and clay mineralogy of the Upper Triassic shales indicate the presence of mainly illite while kaolinite is a minor component. The kaolinite content, a reflection of the mature stage of chemical weathering and hence hot–humid conditions, increases up-section in the overlying shales and sandstone–shale succession. The following laterite–bauxite horizons lack illite and are entirely composed of kaolinite, boehmite and haematite. The bulk rock geochemistry of the succession confirms a similar trend. The Chemical Index of Alteration (CIAmolar) displays an increasing trend from the Upper Triassic (CIA 68–80) to the overlying Lower Jurassic strata (CIA 90–97). The overall results for the succession reveal an increasing chemical maturity trend from Rhaetian to Hettangian thereby supporting a change from warm-arid to a hot and humid palaeoclimate, probably extreme greenhouse conditions. Similar changes in the clay mineralogy and sediment geochemistry across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary have been reported from basins across Europe. Thus the Salt Range provides sections from the southern hemisphere for correlations across the Triassic–Jurassic boundary.},

abstract = {Gondwana was an enormous supertarrane. At its peak, it represented a landmass of about 100 × 106 km2 in size, corresponding to approximately 64{\%} of all land areas today. Gondwana assembled in the Middle Cambrian, merged with Laurussia to form Pangea in the Carboniferous, and finally disintegrated with the separation of East and West Gondwana at about 170 Ma, and the separation of Africa and South America around 130 Ma. Here we have updated plate reconstructions from Gondwana history, with a special emphasis on the interactions between the continental crust of Gondwana and the mantle plumes resulting in Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) at its surface. Moreover, we present an overview of the subvolcanic parts of the Gondwana LIPs (Kalkarindji, Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, Karoo and the Paran{\'{a}}–Etendeka) aimed at summarizing our current understanding of timings, scale and impact of these provinces. The Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) reveals a conservative volume estimate of 700 000 km3 of subvolcanic intrusions, emplaced in the Brazilian sedimentary basins (58–66{\%} of the total CAMP sill volume). The detailed evolution and melt-flux estimates for the CAMP and Gondwana-related LIPs are, however, poorly constrained, as they are not yet sufficiently explored with high-precision U–Pb geochronology.},

Widespread aberrant plant remains across the Permian-Triassic boundary provide evidence that atmospheric stress contributed to the collapse in terrestrial diversity. We used detailed estimates of magmatic degassing from the Siberian Traps to complete the first three-dimensional global climate modeling of atmospheric chemistry during eruption of a large igneous province. Our results show that both strongly acidic rain and global ozone collapse are possible transient consequences of episodic pyroclastic volcanism and heating of volatile-rich Siberian country rocks. We suggest that in conjunction with abrupt warming from greenhouse gas emissions, these repeated, rapidly applied atmospheric stresses directly linked Siberian magmatism to end-Permian ecological failure on land. Our comprehensive modeling supplies the first picture of the global distribution and severity of acid rain and ozone depletion, providing testable predictions for the geography of end-Permian environmental proxies.},

abstract = {Realistic appraisal of paleoclimatic information obtained from a particular location requires accurate knowledge of its paleolatitude defined relative to the Earth's spin-axis. This is crucial to, among others, correctly assess the amount of solar energy received at a location at the moment of sediment deposition. The paleolatitude of an arbitrary location can in principle be reconstructed from tectonic plate reconstructions that (1) restore the relative motions between plates based on (marine) magnetic anomalies, and (2) reconstruct all plates relative to the spin axis using a paleomagnetic reference frame based on a global apparent polar wander path. Whereas many studies do employ high-quality relative plate reconstructions, the necessity of using a paleomagnetic reference frame for climate studies rather than a mantle reference frame appears under-appreciated. In this paper, we briefly summarize the theory of plate tectonic reconstructions and their reference frames tailored towards applications of paleoclimate reconstruction, and show that using a mantle reference frame, which defines plate positions relative to the mantle, instead of a paleomagnetic reference frame may introduce errors in paleolatitude of more than 15° ({\textgreater}1500 km). This is because mantle reference frames cannot constrain, or are specifically corrected for the effects of true polar wander. We used the latest, state-of-the-art plate reconstructions to build a global plate circuit, and developed an online, user-friendly paleolatitude calculator for the last 200 million years by placing this plate circuit in three widely used global apparent polar wander paths. As a novelty, this calculator adds error bars to paleolatitude estimates that can be incorporated in climate modeling. The calculator is available at www.paleolatitude.org. We illustrate the use of the paleolatitude calculator by showing how an apparent wide spread in Eocene sea surface temperatures of southern high latitudes may be in part explained by a much wider paleolatitudinal distribution of sites than previously assumed.},

abstract = {Five shafts of large long bones of dinosaurs have been found since 1846 in the Rhaetic Bone bed of the Westbury Formation (Upper Triassic) at Aust Cliff near Bristol,Avon, southwestern England. Two bones (1 lost) are Dinosauria incertae sedis and a third (also lost), the longest and best preserved, was probably part of a femur of the melanorosaurid prosauropod Camelotia (Upper Triassic, England). The width of the other two femoral shafts is greater transversely than anteroposteriorly, as in Camelotia. However, these shafts are also straight in lateral view, a derived character that occurs only in sauropods and stegosaurs and some Cretaceous ankylosaurs and ornithopods. However, the shafts are curved in lateral view in basal ankylosaurs and Jurassic ornithopods. Unlike the femora of Upper Jurassic sauropods and stegosaurs, in which the bone is almost solid, the Aust shafts consist of a thin layer of compact cortical bone surrounding a large area, most of which is filled with very lightly constructed cancellous bone. However, cross-sections of the humerus just below the deltopectoral crest of the sauropod Isanosaurus (Upper Triassic, Thailand) and the stegosaur Dacentrurus (Upper Jurassic, England) are intermediate in their histology. The femoral shaft is hollow in some Jurassic stegosaurs, though not to the degree shown by those from Aust. The Aust shafts are truly columnar, agreeing with those of stegosaurs in the apparent lack of a prominent fourth trochanter and of the associated posteromedial depression, structures which are prominent in sauropods. These two shafts, with estimated femoral lengths of about 1000-1100 mm, are tentatively referred to the Stegosauria so stegosaurs probably reached a large size in the Upper Triassic; the earliest definitive record of the group is Middle Jurassic (Bathonian) of England.},

abstract = {Sr concentrations in Phanerozoic biological calcite suggest a close link between fluctuations in the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater, aragonite versus calcite sedimentation, and the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater, the entire chain being driven by the rate of production and hydrothermal alteration of the oceanic crust. Model simulations suggest that variations in hydrothermal and continental weathering fluxes cannot be the sole reason for the observed Phanerozoic seawater Sr/Ca trend. Changing Sr burial in marine carbonates is likely the most important mechanism that can explain the experimental data. During episodes of high seawater Mg/Ca ratios, aragonite was preferentially deposited, resulting in low seawater Sr/Ca ratios. At low Mg/Ca ratios, calcite was the dominant carbonate sediment, and the Sr/Ca ratio of seawater was high. The evidence for changing chemistry of seawater also has implications for the application of the Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca paleothermometers, in particular for pre-Quaternary samples, and for the assessment of diagenetic alteration of fossil skeletal carbonates by using Sr/Ca ratios.},

abstract = {A dataset of 160 isotope $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values from Anisian, Ladinian, Carnian and Rhaetian articulate brachiopod shells, complemented by 158 carbon and oxygen isotope values from whole rock carbonates, define the first continuous stable isotope baseline trends for the Triassic seawater. The carbon isotope data suggest the existence of several short-term high amplitude excursions in the Early Triassic, followed by a predominance of values around 0.5 ± 1‰ during the Middle Triassic, a rise to ∼ 3.5‰ during the Carnian, plateau at this level during the Late Carnian to Early Norian, and a 1.5‰ decline in the Middle Norian to values around 2‰ during the Late Norian-Rhaetian interval. The causation scenarios for these rapid oscillations are at present equivocal, but may in part reflect a biological instability of the carbon cycle following the recovery from the end-Permian extinction event and/or an input of "mantle"-derived CO2from enhanced volcanic activity. The $\delta$18O values from well-preserved brachiopods from the Tethyan realm range from - 3.9 to - 0.6‰ V-PDB. These values require open marine Triassic seawater $\delta$18O values close to 0‰ V-SMOW for the calculated temperatures to be within the range of tolerance of the coexisting reef-building corals. A 2‰ $\delta$18O increase within the uppermost Cordevolian and early Julian suggests either a distinct temperature decline in the Southern Alps during that time interval, an increase in seawater salinity, or their combination. Oxygen isotope values for the Muschelkalk brachiopods range between - 6.2 and - 2.0‰ and likely reflect a strong influx of meteoric waters into the Germanic Basin that shifted the oxygen isotopes to more negative values. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Here, we present the palynological record from two shallow core holes (6611/09-U-01 and -02) from the Tr{\o}ndelag Platform offshore mid-Norway consisting of 750 m of Upper Permian and Lower Triassic sediments. The relatively homogeneous assemblages recovered from the Upper Permian deposits are dominated by gymnosperm pollen, mainly pteridosperms. At the base of the Griesbachian, numerous spore species appear in the record, leading to an increased diversity. The change at this boundary is also marked by the massive reduction of one group of pteridosperm pollen (Vittatina). Together with other typical Permian elements (e.g., Lueckisporites virkkiae), this group is rare but consistently present in the lower part of the Griesbachian, and it gradually disappears in its upper part. The distribution of other groups such as taeniate and non-taeniate bisaccate gymnosperm pollen (pterido sperms and conifers) shows no significant change across the boundary, whereas spores and other gymnosperm pollen increase in diversity and abundance. These changes coincide with the formational change between the Schuchert Dal Formation (Upper Permian) and the Wordie Creek Formation (Griesbachian) equivalents. Late Permian and Griesbachian palynomorph assemblages display different patterns. The former show a homogeneous composition of low diversity, whereas the latter reflect diverse and variably composed floras. The data suggest that the arid phase of the Late Permian was followed by a humid phase at the base of the Griesbachian. In the Griesbachian section, a succession of six distinct palyno logical assemblages (phase II-VII) can be inferred. Comparable changes have been described from East Greenland. The variations in the palynological record are interpreted to reflect changing ecological conditions (e.g., changing humidity). Comparable variations in the distribution of 13C isotope values reported from various sections from Greenland and China, showing stable values during the Late Permian and highly variable values during the Griesbachian, suggest common causes for the observed fluctuations. Multiphase volcanic activity of the Siberian traps seems to be the most likely candidate to have caused the variations in the 13C isotope as well as in the palynological record. In contrast to the common claim that marine and terrestrial biota both suffered a mass extinction related to the Permian-Triassic boundary event, the studied material from the Norwegian midlatitudinal sites shows no evidence for destruction of plant ecosystems. The presence of diverse microfloras of Griesbachian age supports the idea that the climate in this area allowed most plants to survive the Permian-Triassic boundary event. {\textcopyright} 2010 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Permian-Triassic boundary microbialites (PTBMs) are thin (0.05-15 m) carbonates formed after the end-Permian mass extinction. They comprise Renalcis-group calcimicrobes, microbially mediated micrite, presumed inorganic micrite, calcite cement (some may be microbially influenced) and shelly faunas. PTBMs are abundant in low-latitude shallow-marine carbonate shelves in central Tethyan continents but are rare in higher latitudes, likely inhibited by clastic supply on Pangaea margins. PTBMs occupied broadly similar environments to Late Permian reefs in Tethys, but extended into deeper waters. Late Permian reefs are also rich in microbes (and cements), so post-extinction seawater carbonate saturation was likely similar to the Late Permian. However, PTBMs lack widespread abundant inorganic carbonate cement fans, so a previous interpretation that anoxic bicarbonate-rich water upwelled to rapidly increase carbonate saturation of shallow seawater, post-extinction, is problematic. Preliminary pyrite framboid evidence shows anoxia in PTBM facies, but interbedded shelly faunas indicate oxygenated water, perhaps there was short-term pulsing of normally saturated anoxic water from the oxygen-minimum zone to surface waters. In Tethys, PTBMs show geographic variations: (i) in south China, PTBMs are mostly thrombolites in open shelf settings, largely recrystallised, with remnant structure of Renalcis-group calcimicrobes; (ii) in south Turkey, in shallow waters, stromatolites and thrombolites, lacking calcimicrobes, are interbedded, likely depth-controlled; and (iii) in the Middle East, especially Iran, stromatolites and thrombolites (calcimicrobes uncommon) occur in different sites on open shelves, where controls are unclear. Thus, PTBMs were under more complex control than previously portrayed, with local facies control playing a significant role in their structure and composition.},

abstract = {Vivianite, a hydrated iron phosphate, is abundant in sediments of Lake El'gygytgyn, located in the Anadyr Mountains of central Chukotka, northeastern Russia (67 degree 30' N, 172 degree 05' E). Magnetic measurements, including mass-specific low-field AC magnetic susceptibility, field-dependent magnetic susceptibility, hysteresis parameters, temperature dependence of the induced magnetization, as well as susceptibility in different heating media, provide ample information on vivianite nodules. Electron microprobe analyses, electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy were used to identify diagnostic minerals. Vivianite nodules are abundant in both sediments of cold (anoxic) and warm (oxic) stages. Magnetic susceptibility of the nodules varies from 0.78 10 super(-6) m super(3) kg super(-1) to 1.72 10 super(-6) m super(3) kg super(-1) (average = 1.05 10 super(-6) m super(3) kg super(-1)) and is higher than the susceptibility of sediments from the cold intervals. Magnetic properties of vivianite are due to the respective product of oxidation as well as sediment and mineral inclusions. Three types of curves for high-temperature dependent susceptibility of vivianite indicate different degrees of oxidation and inclusions in the nodules. Vivianite acts as a reductant and reduces hematite to magnetite and masks the goethite-hematite transition during heating. Heating vivianite and sulfur mixtures stimulates the formation of monoclinic pyrrhotite. An additive of arsenic inhibits the formation of magnetite prior to its Curie temperature.

abstract = {THE deep ocean is the storehouse for most of the carbon and nutrients in the ocean–atmosphere system; together with its out-crops at high latitudes, the deep ocean is of great importance in driving glacial–interglacial changes in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere1–3. The chemical and physical structure of the deep glacial oceans can be reconstructed by means of palaeochemical tracers; for example, the cadmium and carbon isotope contents of benthic foraminifera have been used to reconstruct the phosphate (or labile nutrient) compositions of deep waters4–14. Recently, it was proposed15 that barium in benthic foraminifera could be used to reconstruct the distribution of refractory, deep-regenerated chemical properties in the water masses of the glacial oceans. A reconstruction of barium concentra-tions in the oceans at the time of the Last Glacial Maximum revealed the greatest changes in the North Atlantic, where barium concentrations in deep water were up to 50{\%} higher than at present16. Here we present a record of the benthic Ba/Ca ratio in the deep northwest Atlantic stretching back to interglacial stage 7 ({\~{}}210 kyr ago), encompassing two full glacial cycles. A comparison of the barium record with that of the other nutrient-like tracers lends confidence in the general agreement between these tracers while showing some spectral variability unique to barium, thus underscoring its utility as an additional palaeoceanographic tracer.},

abstract = {A simple procedure for preparing barite samples for chemical and isotopic analysis is described. Sulfate ion, in barite, in the presence of high concentrations of aqueous sodium carbonate, is replaced by carbonate. This replacement forms insoluble carbonates with the cations commonly in barite: Ba, Sr, Ca and Pb. Sulfate is released into the solution by the carbonate replacement and is separated by filtration. The aqueous sulfate can then be reprecipitated for analysis of the sulfur and oxygen isotopes. The cations in the carbonate phase can be dissolved by acidifying the solid residue. Sr can be separated from the solution for Sr isotope analysis by ion-exchange chromatography. The sodium carbonate used contains amounts of Sr which will affect almost all barite 87Sr86Sr ratios by less than 0.00001 at 1.95$\theta$ of the mean. The procedure is preferred over other techniques used for preparing barite samples for the determination of 87Sr86Sr ratios because it is simple, rapid and enables simultaneous determination of many compositional parameters on the same material.},

abstract = {The sulfur biogeochemical cycle integrates the metabolic activity of multiple microbial pathways (e.g., sulfate reduction, disproportionation, and sulfide oxidation) along with abiotic reactions and geological processes that cycle sulfur through various reservoirs. The sulfur cycle impacts the global carbon cycle and climate primarily through the remineralization of organic carbon. Over geological timescales, cycling of sulfur is closely tied to the redox state of Earth's exosphere through the burial of oxidized (sulfate) and reduced (sulfide) sulfur species in marine sediments. Biological sulfur cycling is associated with isotopic fractionations that can be used to trace the fluxes through various metabolic pathways. The resulting isotopic data provide insights into sulfur cycling in both modern and ancient environments via isotopic signatures in sedimentary sulfate and sulfide phases. Here, we review the deep-time $\delta$34S record of marine sulfates and sulfides in light of recent advances in understanding how isotopic signatures are generated by microbial activity, how these signatures are encoded in marine sediments, and how they may be altered following deposition. The resulting picture shows a sulfur cycle intimately coupled to ambient carbon cycling, where sulfur isotopic records preserved in sedimentary rocks are critically dependent on sedimentological and geochemical conditions (e.g., iron availability) during deposition.},

abstract = {The pattern of variation in taxonomic turnover on short timescales is expected to leave detectable signals even when taxonomic data are compiled at coarser timescales. Global, stage-level data on first and last appearances of marine animal genera are analyzed to determine whether it is more likely that origination and extinction were spread throughout stages or that they were concentrated at a single episode per stage. The analysis takes incomplete and variable sampling of stratigraphic ranges into consideration, and it takes advantage of the fact that empirical sampling rates are within the range of values that allow the within-stage turnover models to be distinguished on the basis of stage-level data. The data strongly support the model of a single extinction pulse per stage over the alternative of continuous extinction within the stage. Pulsed origination is also supported over continuous origination, but the case is not as compelling as for extinction. Differential support for pulsed turnover is not confined to a few stages. Pulsed turnover therefore appears to be a general feature of the evolution of marine animals.},

Compositionally, the grains were dominated by Si, Al, Fe, and K, in a stoichiometry similar to a dioctahedral smectite. The initial dissolution of glass, which may in part have been microbiologically mediated, served as the source for many of the elements sequestered into the biomineralized clays. Overlying the tephras are white crusts (silica and calcite) and green-colored biofilms. The biofilms comprise a filamentous, likely cyanobacterial, community coated with spherical 100 nm in diameter) grains of amorphous silica directly attached to the sheaths. Individual precipitates can easily be resolved, but quite often they coalesce, forming a dense mineral matrix of amorphous silica. For both the clays and silica, the microbial surfaces are clearly sites for mineral nucleation and growth. These observations imply that microbial biomineralization may be a significant process in the overall alteration of primary basaltic glass in active steam vent systems.},

Rudist skeletal components with preserved original mineralogy of aragonite and {\{}low-Mg{\}} calcite, and with preserved microstructures, have isotopic signatures analogous to Holocene marine bivalves. This similarity argues for a comparable isotopic composition of the Cretaceous and Holocene seawater, as well as for a similar mode of incorporation of stable isotopes into their shells.

abstract = {Outcrops of the Lower Triassic (Spathian) Virgin Limestone Member (Moenkopi Formation) in the southwestern United States contain the oldest known metazoan bioherms formed in the aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction. These small buildups, up to 1.0 m in diameter and 0.2 m high, were constructed by cementing bivalves. The bivalve bioherms accreted in a shallow, subtidal environment above storm wave base atop an oolitic hardground on a carbonate ramp. Similarities in shell microstructure and bioherm morphology between the Lower Triassic buildups reported here and previously described Middle Triassic occurrences suggest that the Lower Triassic bioherms were likely built by a bivalve assignable to Placunopsis. Although taxonomic assignment of the bivalve remains uncertain, the presence of cemented bivalve bioherms in Lower Triassic sections of the southwestern United States demonstrates that cementing bivalves were geographically widespread, even early in their Mesozoic evolutionary history. Despite their bioherm-building ecology, cementing bivalves do not occur in Middle Triassic platform-margin reefs, underscoring the decoupling of the recovery of framework-building metazoans from the return of large carbonate platform-margin reefs in the wake of the end-Permian mass extinction. These first Mesozoic bioherms built by metazoans represent a significant ecological advance in the evolutionary history of bivalves in that the cementing life-mode had reappeared before the end of the Early Triassic.},

abstract = {The Palaeoarchean supracrustal belts in Greenland contain Earth's oldest rocks and are a prime target in the search for the earliest evidence of life on Earth. However, metamorphism has largely obliterated original rock textures and compositions, posing a challenge to the preservation of biological signatures. A recent study of 3,700-million-year-old rocks of the Isua supracrustal belt in Greenland described a rare zone in which low deformation and a closed metamorphic system allowed preservation of primary sedimentary features, including putative conical and domical stromatolites1 (laminated accretionary structures formed by microbially mediated sedimentation). The morphology, layering, mineralogy, chemistry and geological context of the structures were attributed to the formation of microbial mats in a shallow marine environment by 3,700 million years ago, at the start of Earth's rock record. Here we report new research that shows a non-biological, post-depositional origin for the structures. Three-dimensional analysis of the morphology and orientation of the structures within the context of host rock fabrics, combined with texture-specific analyses of major and trace element chemistry, show that the ‘stromatolites' are more plausibly interpreted as part of an assemblage of deformation structures formed in carbonate-altered metasediments long after burial. The investigation of the structures of the Isua supracrustal belt serves as a cautionary tale in the search for signs of past life on Mars, highlighting the importance of three-dimensional, integrated analysis of morphology, rock fabrics and geochemistry at appropriate scales.},

abstract = {New ichnological data from the Lower Triassic Werfen Formation (Dolomites, Italy) revealed an unexpectedly diverse and complex ichnofauna in mixed siliclastic–carbonate shelf sediments of the western tropical Tethys shortly after the end-Permian mass extinction event. Common elements are Thalassinoides, Palaeophycus and Planolites. Other associated ichnogenera include Spongeliomorpha, Rhizocorallium, Lockeia, Catenichnus, Helminthopsis, and Taenidium. One structure is tentatively determined as Curvolithus. Biostratigraphic data (conodonts and bivalves) of the trace fossil interval (lower Seis/Siusi Member) suggest a late Griesbachian age, less than 1 Ma after the end-Permian mass extinction event. Similarly diverse ichnofossil communities from this time interval have recently been described from the Boreal Realm, but this is the first record of a diverse Griesbachian ichnoassemblage from the tropics, indicating that the early recovery of trace fossil producers was not latitudinally restricted, as previously proposed. Accordingly, relatively advanced recovery stages were reached on a global scale much earlier than the Spathian as is commonly acknowledged. The early and interregional peak in ichnofaunal recovery implies subsequent ecological setbacks in post-Griesbachian times that explain the overall delay of benthic recovery until the Spathian. Rather than persistent catastrophic conditions during the Griesbachian, a global and synchronous succession of crises and relaxation phases after the Griesbachian is proposed as an explanatory model for the recovery pattern of benthic ecosystems.},

Lowest oxygen isotopes values were found in G. ruber (pink), followed by G. ruber (white) and G. trilobus reflecting the highly stratified near surface water conditions north of the BMC. Globigerina bulloides was present mainly south of the BMC and records subsurface conditions supporting earlier plankton tow studies. Globorotalia inflata and G. truncatulinoides (left and right) were both available over the whole transect and calcify in the depth level with the steepest temperature change across the BMC. Accordingly, the $\delta$18O of these species depict a sharp gradient of 2‰ at the confluence with remarkably stable values north and south of the BMC. Our data show that the oxygen isotopic composition of G. inflata and G. truncatulinoides (left and right) are the most reliable indicators for the present position of the BMC and can therefore be used to define the past migration of the front if appropriate cores are available. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Differential X-ray powder diffraction (DXRD) and extraction procedures were used to characterize the iron oxides present in four sediments from contrasting environments in the North Sea. Stations were located in depositional areas on the southern shelf (German Bight) and on the north-eastern shelf-slope transition (Skagerrak) and in areas with no net deposition in the southern North Sea. Poorly crystalline ferrihydrite and akageneite (extractable with 0.1 M HCl and 0.2 M NH4-oxalate) were identified in the fine sediment fraction ({\textless} 10 $\mu$m) of surface samples at all locations. Evidence for the dominant role of these Fe oxides in the binding of phosphorus in North Sea sediments was obtained from the good relationship of both the content of Fe-bound P and the linear adsorption coefficient for phosphate with NH4-oxalate extractable Fe. A tight coupling of pore water Fe2+and HPO42-was observed at 3 stations. Pore water Fe2+/HPO42-ratios at maximum pore water concentrations of Fe2+were similar to NH4-oxalate Fe/Fe-bound P ratios for surface sediment at these locations, and were in the range known for synthetic poorly crystalline Fe oxides. This suggests that pore water HPO42-production at the time of core collection was dominated by release from poorly crystalline Fe oxides. In contrast, at the German Bight station, much higher HPO42-levels and a decoupling of pore water Fe2+and HPO42-was observed, suggesting a larger contribution of mineralization of organic matter to pore water HPO42-than at the other sites. Solid phase P analyses indicate possible redistribution of Fe-bound P to another inorganic phase at depth at the Skagerrak station, but not at the other stations. The persistence with depth of poorly crystalline Fe oxides and Fe-bound P suggests that these Fe phases can act as both a temporary and permanent sink for P in continental margin sediments. {\textcopyright} 1996 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {High-resolution event stratigraphy is a new and powerful tool of regional stratigraphy. It can be used to precisely correlate stratigraphic sections and develop theory and tests for basin analysis, paleoceanography, paleoclimatology, evolution, and biostratigraphy. In the Western Interior Basin of North America, the Cretaceous marine sequence is dominantly composed of allocyclic and perturbational event units that are isochronous or short term (100 kyr or shorter) in aspect. These have allowed a very detailed HIRES to be developed, with resolution in correlation between 50 and 100 kyr, and less for some intervals. This exceeds the resolution of any other system of stratigraphy. HIRES has many applications, and it is still in the development and testing stage.},

abstract = {The end-Triassic is characterized by one of the most severe biotic crises of the entire Phanerozoic, with strong carbon cycle perturbations potentially predating the biotic event. In order to improve and test the chemostratigraphic framework for the Rhaetian Stage, which culminated in the end-Triassic extinction, a total of 675 and 108 carbonate $\delta$13 C and $\delta$18 O values have been measured from bulk rock carbonate and articulate brachiopod samples from the Rhaetian Eiberg quarry succession (Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria) respectively. Both brachiopod and bulk rock oxygen isotope trends are compatible with a sedimentologically-constrained basinal deepening, culminating in unit 3 of the latest Rhaetian Eiberg Member. Brachiopod calcite $\delta$18 O evolving from –1.4‰ to –0.5‰ V-PDB in this interval is offset to heavier values than bulk carbonates by circa 0.5 ‰, compatible with biomineralization in deeper water than the calcite composing the bulk rock micrite. Significant metabolic disequilibrium effects on brachiopod carbon isotope ratios are suggested by a clear negative correlation between $\delta$13 C values and Sr/Ca ratios of the samples. Consequently, chemostratigraphy based on brachiopod $\delta$13 C data, especially with regard to short-term events, is limited. High-resolution bulk rock $\delta$13 C data show a {\textgreater}1 ‰ increasing trend throughout units 3 and 4 of the Hochalm Member, and first two units of the Eiberg Member reaching values of circa +2.5‰. This trend is reversed by a circa 1‰ negative shift across the boundary of units 2 and 3 of the Eiberg Member. This latter negative shift, known as the "Late Rhaetian Event", represents an important chemostratigraphic marker in the Eiberg quarry section, but its superregional significance remains to be confirmed.},

abstract = {Enthalpies of formation of ferrihydrite and schwertmannite were measured by acid solution calorimetry in 5 N HCl at 298 K. The published thermodynamic data for these two phases and $\epsilon$-Fe2O3were evaluated, and the best thermodynamic data for the studied compounds were selected. Ferrihydrite is metastable in enthalpy with respect to 1/2 $\alpha$-Fe2O3and liquid water by 11.5 to 14.7 kJ•mol-1at 298.15 K. The less positive enthalpy corresponds to 6-line ferrihydrite, and the higher one, indicating lesser stability, to 2-line ferrihydrite. In other words, ferrihydrite samples become more stable with increasing crystallinity. The best thermodynamic data set for ferrihydrite of composition Fe(OH)3was selected by using the measured enthalpies and (1) requiring ferrihydrite to be metastable with respect to fine-grained lepidocrocite; (2) requiring ferrihydrite to have entropy higher than the entropy of hypothetical, well-crystalline Fe(OH)3; and (3) considering published estimates of solubility products of ferrihydrite. The $\Delta$G°ffor 2-line ferrihydrite is best described by a range of -708.5±2.0 to -705.2±2.0 kJ•mol-1, and $\Delta$G°ffor 6-line ferrihydrite by -711.0±2.0 to -708.5±2.0 kJ•mol-1. A published enthalpy measurement by acid calorimetry of $\epsilon$-Fe2O3was re-evaluated, arriving at $\Delta$H°f($\epsilon$-Fe2O3) = -798.0±6.6 kJ•mol-1. The standard entropy (S°) of $\epsilon$-Fe2O3was considered to be equal to S° ($\gamma$-Fe2O3) (93.0±0.2 J•K-1•mol-1), giving $\Delta$G°f($\epsilon$-Fe2O3) = -71 7.8±6.6 kJ•mol-1. $\epsilon$-Fe2O3thus appears to have no stability field, and it is metastable with respect to most phases in the Fe2O3-H2O system which is probably the reason why this phase is rare in nature. Enthalpies of formation of two schwertmannite samples are: $\Delta$H°f(FeO(OH)0.686(SO4)0.157•0.972H2O) = -884.0±1.3 kJ•mol-1, $\Delta$H°f(FeO(OH)0.664(SO4)0.168•1.226H2O) = -960.7±1.2 kJ•mol-1. When combined with an entropy estimate, these data give Gibbs free energies of formation of -761.3 ± 1.3 and -823.3 ± 1.2 kJ•mol-1for the two samples, respectively. These $\Delta$Gf° values imply that schwertmannite is thermodynamically favored over ferrihydrite over a wide range of pH (2-8) when the system contains even small concentration of sulfate. The stability relations of the two investigated samples can be replicated by schwertmannite of the "ideal" composition FeO(OH)3/4(SO4)1/8with $\Delta$G°f= -518.0±2.0 kJ•mol-1. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

These values match, within an experimental error of ±4 million years, the dates for zircons extracted from a tuff at the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the P-Tr extinction was caused by the Siberian basaltic flood volcanism. It is likely that the eruption of these magmas was accompanied by the injection of large amounts of sulfur dioxide into the upper atmosphere, which may have led to global cooling and to expansion of the polar ice cap. The P-Tr extinction event may have been caused by a combination of acid rain and global cooling as well as rapid and extreme changes in sea level resulting from expansion of the polar ice cap.},

Methane has isotopic values ($\delta$13C) low enough to reduce to feasible amounts the carbon required for isotopic mass balance. The duration of the carbon isotopic excursions and inferred methane releases are here constrained to {\textless}10,000 yr by counting annual varves in lake deposits and by estimating peat accumulation rates. On paleogeographic maps, the most marked carbon isotope excursions form linear arrays back to plausible methane sources: end‐Permian Siberian Traps and Longwood‐Bluff intrusions of New Zealand and end‐Guadalupian Emeishan Traps of China. Intrusion of coal seams by feeder dikes to flood basalts could create successive thermogenic methane outbursts of the observed timing and magnitude, but these are unreasonably short times for replenishment of marine or permafrost sources of methane. Methane released by fracturing and heating of coal during intrusion of large igneous provinces may have been a planetary hazard comparable with bolide impact.},

abstract = {Pyrite framboid diameter analysis and organic geochemistry of the triangularis/crepida boundary section at Kowala (Holy Cross Mountains, Poland) imply suboxic to oxic and sporadically euxinic bottom waters during the Lower Famennian. In addition, morphological web-like structures typical for microbial mats, as well as the recognition of 2{\^{I}}±-methylhopanes and monomethyl-alkane cyanobacteria biomarkers is evidenced of microbial activity after the global Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) extinction event. The presence of cyanobacterial mats also suggests suboxic to oxic environments and at the same time photic bottom water conditions. However, isorenieratane and its derivatives were detected in almost all samples. The presence of this well-known biomarker of green sulfur bacteria implies that euxinic conditions were present in the upper part of the water column at least intermittently or that temporal euxinia occurred in the water column. Presence of euxinic conditions is confirmed by the occurrence of small-sized pyrite framboids which were particularly dominant in the lower part of the section. The shift towards low $\delta$13C values in both micritic limestones and in sedimentary organic matter seen at the beginning of the period of diminished photic zone, might reflect an influx of newly respired CO2 to surface waters, caused by enhanced respiration at depth after the F/F transition in the Ch{\"{A}}™ciny-Zbrza basin.},

abstract = {Biogenic components of sediment accumulated at high rates beneath frontal zones of the Indian and Pacific oceans during the late Miocene and early Pliocene. The $\delta$13C of bulk and foraminiferal carbonate also decreased during this time interval. Although the two observations may be causally linked, and signify a major perturbation in global biogeochemical cycling, no site beneath a frontal zone has independent records of export production and $\delta$13C on multiple carbonate phases across the critical interval of interest. Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) site 590 lies beneath the Tasman Front (TF), an eddy-generating jetstream in the southwest Pacific Ocean. To complement previous $\delta$13C records of planktic and benthic foraminifera at this location, late Neogene records of CaCO3mass accumulation rate (MAR), Ca/Ti, Ba/Ti, Al/Ti, and of bulk carbonate and foraminiferal $\delta$13C were constructed at site 590. The $\delta$13C records include bulk sediment, bulk sediment fractions ({\textless} 63 $\mu$m and 5-25 $\mu$m), and the planktic foraminifera Globigerina bulloides, Globigerinoides sacculifer (with and without sac), and Orbulina universa. Using current time scales, CaCO3MARs, Ca/Ti, Al/Ti and Ba/Ti ratios are two to three times higher in upper Miocene and lower Pliocene sediment relative to overlying and underlying units. A significant decrease also occurs in all $\delta$13C records. All evidence indicates that enhanced export production - the 'biogenic bloom' - extended to the southwest Pacific Ocean between ca. 9 and 3.8 Ma, and this phenomenon is coupled with changes in $\delta$13C - the 'Chron C3AR carbon shift'. However, CaCO3MARs peak ca. 5 Ma whereas elemental ratios are highest ca. 6.5 Ma; foraminiferal $\delta$13C starts to decrease ca. 8 Ma whereas bulk carbonate $\delta$13C begins to drop ca. 5.6 Ma. Temporal discrepancies between the records can be explained by changes in the upwelling regime at the TF, perhaps signifying a link between changes in ocean-atmosphere circulation change and widespread primary productivity. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

The Jurassic Laurasian Seaway, which connected the low-latitude Tethys Ocean with the Arctic Sea is modeled quantitatively. The global ocean is found to have a profound influence on seaway dynamics. A north-south density difference and hence sea level difference of the global ocean was probably the main factor in forcing the seaway flow. When the Tethys waters were the denser water, the net seaway flow was southward, and conversely, it was northward for denser Arctic waters. Marine bioprovincial boundaries and sediment data indicate that the seaway probably was dominated by Boreal faunal groups and reduced salinities several times in the Jurassic. The model results suggest that this can be explained by southward flowing seaway currents, which may have been related to an oceanic thermohaline circulation where no northern high-latitude deep convection occurred.},

abstract = {Previsions of a warmer ocean as a consequence of climatic change point to a 2-6 degrees C temperature rise during this century in surface oceanic waters. Heterotrophic bacteria occupy the central position of the marine microbial food web, and their metabolic activity and interactions with other compartments within the web are regulated by temperature. In particular, key ecosystem processes like bacterial production (BP), respiration (BR), growth efficiency and bacterial-grazer trophic interactions are likely to change in a warmer ocean. Different approaches can be used to predict these changes. Here we combine evidence of the effects of temperature on these processes and interactions coming from laboratory experiments, space-for-time substitutions, long-term data from microbial observatories and theoretical predictions. Some of the evidence we gathered shows opposite trends to warming depending on the spatio-temporal scale of observation, and the complexity of the system under study. In particular, we show that warming (i) increases BR, (ii) increases bacterial losses to their grazers, and thus bacterial-grazer biomass flux within the microbial food web, (iii) increases BP if enough resources are available (as labile organic matter derived from phytoplankton excretion or lysis), and (iv) increases bacterial losses to grazing at lower rates than BP, and hence decreasing the proportion of production removed by grazers. As a consequence, bacterial abundance would also increase and reinforce the already dominant role of microbes in the carbon cycle of a warmer ocean.},

@article{Oelkers2008a,
abstract = {A survey of the global carbon reservoirs suggests that the most stable, long-term storage mechanism for atmospheric CO2 is the formation of carbonate minerals such as calcite, dolomite and magnesite. The feasibility is demonstrated by the proportion of terrestrial carbon bound in these minerals: at least 40,000 times more carbon is present in carbonate rocks than in the atmosphere. Atmospheric carbon can be transformed into carbonate minerals either ex situ, as part of an industrial process, or in situ, by injection into geological formations where the elements required for carbonate-mineral formation are present. Many challenges in mineral carbonation remain to be resolved. They include overcoming the slow kinetics of mineral-fluid reactions, dealing with the large volume of source material required and reducing the energy needed to hasten the carbonation process. To address these challenges, several pilot studies have been launched, including the CarbFix program in Iceland. The aim of CarbFix is to inject CO2 into permeable basaltic rocks in an attempt to form carbonate minerals directly through a coupled dissolution-precipitation process.},

@article{Doyle2018,
abstract = {The apparent lag between the first permanent rise of atmospheric oxygen to appreciable levels and oxygenation of the deep ocean has focused efforts in deciphering the evolution of seawater chemistry across the Proterozoic Eon (2.5–0.542 Ga). It is generally accepted that from ∼1.85 Ga oxic shallow marine waters were widespread while the deep ocean remained dominantly ferruginous (Fe(II)-rich), with episodic euxinia confined to productive continental margins and intracontinental basins. The geochemical record that informs this picture, however, is currently sparse, and further studies are required to adequately evaluate temporal and spatial variability in ocean redox conditions across this vast expanse of time. Here, we report Fe-S-C systematics, alongside major (Al, Mn) and trace metal (Mo, U) data for ∼1.6–0.8 Ga marine sediments from the Bashkir Meganticlinorium (BMA), Southern Urals, Russia. Our Fe speciation data reveal a water column dominated by ferruginous conditions, no evidence for euxinia, and oxygenated waters confined to only the shallowest, near-coastal settings. Trace metal data support these findings, with Mo and U enrichment factors in anoxic sediments implying the operation of a particulate Fe (oxyhydr)oxide shuttle under ferruginous conditions as the main mechanism for generating moderate authigenic Mo enrichments. Sulfur isotope systematics imply that predominantly low dissolved sulfate concentrations prevailed throughout the deposition of the BMA succession, which, in combination with a low organic carbon loading, promoted the development of ferruginous, rather than euxinic, water column conditions. The restriction of oxic conditions to the shallowest, near-coastal depositional settings within the Bashkir basin contrasts to other redox studies from this period. Such discrepancies highlight major uncertainty in our understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of water column redox chemistry across the Mesoproterozoic Era, and signify the need for further detailed work to constrain the chemical evolution of the oceans during this crucial time period.},

abstract = {With the growing importance of time series clustering research, particularly for similarity searches amongst long time series such as those arising in medicine or finance, it is critical for us to find a way to resolve the outstanding problems that make most clustering methods impractical under certain circumstances. When the time series is very long, some clustering algorithms may fail because the very notation of similarity is dubious in high dimension space; many methods cannot handle missing data when the clustering is based on a distance metric. This paper proposes a method for clustering of time series based on their structural characteristics. Unlike other alternatives, this method does not cluster point values using a distance metric, rather it clusters based on global features extracted from the time series. The feature measures are obtained from each individual series and can be fed into arbitrary clustering algorithms, including an unsupervised neural network algorithm, self-organizing map, or hierarchal clustering algorithm. Global measures describing the time series are obtained by applying statistical operations that best capture the underlying characteristics: trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, chaos, nonlinearity, and self-similarity. Since the method clusters using extracted global measures, it reduces the dimensionality of the time series and is much less sensitive to missing or noisy data. We further provide a search mechanism to find the best selection from the feature set that should be used as the clustering inputs. The proposed technique has been tested using benchmark time series datasets previously reported for time series clustering and a set of time series datasets with known characteristics. The empirical results show that our approach is able to yield meaningful clusters. The resulting clusters are similar to those produced by other methods, but with some promising and interesting variations that can be intuitively explained with knowledge of the global characteristics of the time series. {\textcopyright} 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

@article{Boulvain2001,
abstract = {Late Frasnian Petit-Mont Member carbonate mounds occur in the southern part of the Dinant Synclinorium and in the Philippeville Anticline (SW Belgium). These mounds are 30 to 80 m thick and 100 to 250 m in diameter. They are embedded in shale, nodular shale and argillaceous limestone. Based on facies mapping of 14 buildups and related off-mound sediments, these mounds typically started from below the photic and storm wave base zones and builtup into shallow water environments. Above an argillaceous limestone substrate, the first carbonate mound facies consists of spiculitic wackestone with stromatactis (PM1), which becomes progressively enriched in crinoids and corals (PM2), then in peloids, stromatoporoids and cyanobacteria (PM3). PM4 consists of algal–coral–peloid wackestone and packstone with green algae and thick algal coatings. A core of algal and microbial bindstone (PM5) sporadically occurs within large mounds. The uppermost part of these mounds may show a recurrence of facies PM2 and PM1. PM1 to PM3 are coloured red by hematite derived from microaerophilic iron bacteria; PM4 and PM5 are grey. The transition from the aphotic to the cyanobacterial photic zone is recorded in the succession PM2–PM3; the transition from the cyanobacterial to the green algal photic zone is recorded by PM3–PM5. Storm wave base was reached within PM3 and fair-weather wave base within PM5. This paleobathymetric interpretation suggests a depth of 100–150 m during initial establishment of PM1. Three types of mounds can be distinguished on the basis of geometry and facies architecture: (1) “Les Bulants”-type mounds display a continuous vertical facies succession (PM2–3–4–5) and low relief; (2) although exhibiting the same facies succession as “Les Bulants”, “Les Wayons”-type mounds show a distinct relief with steep flanks and bioclastic talus; (3) “St.-R{\'{e}}my” mounds consist exclusively of PM1 and PM2, bioclastic flank deposits are not observed. From (1) to (3), these mound types represent successive deepening down a ramp. Biostratigraphic correlation on a regional scale provides good evidence that relative sea-level changes largely controlled lateral and vertical transitions of facies. Beyond that, hypoxic conditions are indicated by the sponge and iron-bacteria consortium in lower parts of the mounds. This is in agreement with the general assumption of stratified water masses during Late Frasnian, preceding the prominent Lower Kellwasser crisis. Cementation began with a radiaxial synsedimentary cement. A fringe of meteoric phreatic cement, initially nonluminescent, then with a bright orange luminescence, occurs in all mounds. It is contemporaneous with a nonluminescent pervasive cement of grainstones deposited in littoral areas. Differentiation between the (reducing) mounds and the (oxidizing) littoral area resulted from better aquifer circulation in sedimentary bodies close to the recharge area. Late burial cements occlude all the remaining porosity and are contemporaneous with the opening of the Variscan fracture system.},

abstract = {The ocean and atmosphere were largely anoxic in the early Precambrian, resulting in an Fe cycle that was dramatically different than today's. Extremely Fe-rich sedimentary deposits-i.e., Fe formations-are the most conspicuous manifestation of this distinct Fe cycle. Rare Earth Element (REE) systematics have long been used as a tool to understand the origin of Fe formations and the corresponding chemistry of the ancient ocean. However, many earlier REE studies of Fe formations have drawn ambiguous conclusions, partially due to analytical limitations and sampling from severely altered units. Here, we present new chemical analyses of Fe formation samples from 18 units, ranging in age from ca. 3.0 to 1.8 billion years old (Ga), which allow a reevaluation of the depositional mechanisms and significance of Precambrian Fe formations. There are several temporal trends in our REE and Y dataset that reflect shifts in marine redox conditions. In general, Archean Fe formations do not display significant shale-normalized negative Ce anomalies, and only Fe formations younger than 1.9. Ga display prominent positive Ce anomalies. Low Y/Ho ratios and high shale-normalized light to heavy REE (LREE/HREE) ratios are also present in ca. 1.9. Ga and younger Fe formations but are essentially absent in their Archean counterparts. These marked differences in Paleoproterozoic versus Archean REE. +. Y patterns can be explained in terms of varying REE cycling in the water column. Similar to modern redox-stratified basins, the REE. +. Y patterns in late Paleoproterozoic Fe formations record evidence of a shuttle of metal and Ce oxides across the redoxcline from oxic shallow seawater to deeper anoxic waters. Oxide dissolution-mainly of Mn oxides-in an anoxic water column lowers the dissolved Y/Ho ratio, raises the light to heavy REE ratio, and increases the concentration of Ce relative to the neighboring REE (La and Pr). Fe oxides precipitating at or near the chemocline will capture these REE anomalies and thus evidence for this oxide shuttle. In contrast, Archean Fe formations do not display REE. +. Y patterns indicative of an oxide shuttle, which implies an absence of a distinct Mn redoxcline prior to the rise of atmospheric oxygen in the early Paleoproterozoic. As further evidence for reducing conditions in shallow-water environments of the Archean ocean, REE data for carbonates deposited on shallow-water Archean carbonate platforms that stratigraphically underlie Fe formations also lack negative Ce anomalies. These results question classical models for deposition of Archean Fe formations that invoke oxidation by free oxygen at or above a redoxcline. In contrast, we add to growing evidence that metabolic Fe oxidation is a more likely oxidative mechanism for these Fe formations, implying that the Fe distribution in Archean oceans could have been controlled by microbial Fe uptake rather than the oxidative potential of shallow-marine environments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Radium and barium uptake onto ferrihydrite and goethite have been studied in the concentration range 1nM to 5mM and from pH 4 to 10, to develop a model to predict radium behaviour in legacy uranium mining wastes. For ferrihydrite, uptake of Ra2+ at nM concentrations was strong at pH {\textgreater} 7. At higher concentrations, Ba2+ sorption to ferrihydrite was slightly weaker than that of Ra2+. Experiments with goethite showed weaker binding for both metal ions in all systems. The interactions of radium with both ferrihydrite and goethite are fully reversible. The behaviour of radium during transformation of ferrihydrite to goethite has been studied, and no evidence for irreversible incorporation within the goethite lattice was found; radium uptake to goethite was the same, whether or not it was present during its formation. Calcium competed with radium for ferrihydrite sorption only at high calcium concentrations ({\textgreater}10mM). Barium is a more effective competitor, and a concentration of 1mM reduced radium sorption. Sediment samples from a legacy uranium mining site have been analysed, and the in situ Rd values are consistent with radium uptake by surface coatings of ferrihydrite or goethite like phases. Surface complexation models have been developed for radium sorption to ferrihydrite and goethite which simulate the experimental data successfully. In both cases, approaches based on a single surface functional group and tetradentate binding sites simulated the data successfully. These data could be used in underpinning the safety case for legacy mining sites.},

abstract = {Early Cretaceous life and the environment were strongly influenced by the accelerated break up of Pangaea, which was associated with the formation of a multitude of rift basins, intensified spreading, and important volcanic activity on land and in the sea. These processes likely interacted with greenhouse conditions, and Early Cretaceous climate oscillated between "normal" greenhouse, predominantly arid conditions, and intensified greenhouse, predominantly humid conditions. Arid conditions were important during the latest Jurassic and early Berriasian, the late Barremian, and partly also during the late Aptian. Humid conditions were particularly intense and widespread during shorter episodes of environmental change (EECs): the Valanginian Weissert, the latest Hauterivian Faraoni, the latest Barremian-earliest Aptian Taxy, the early Aptian Selli, the early late Aptian Fallot and the late Aptian-early Albian Paquier episodes. Arid conditions were associated with evaporation, low biogeochemical weathering rates, low nutrient fluxes, and partly stratified oceans, leading to oxygen depletion and enhanced preservation of laminated, organic-rich mud (LOM). Humid conditions enabled elevated biogeochemical weathering rates and nutrient fluxes, important runoff and the buildup of freshwater lids in proximal basins, intensified oceanic and atmospheric circulation, widespread upwelling and phosphogenesis, important primary productivity and enhanced preservation of LOM in expanded oxygen-minimum zones. The transition of arid to humid climates may have been associated with the net transfer of water to the continent owing to the infill of dried-out groundwater reservoirs in internally drained inland basins. This resulted in shorter-term sea-level fall, which was followed by sea-level rise. These sea-level changes and the influx of freshwater into the ocean may have influenced oxygen-isotope signatures. Climate change preceding and during the Early Cretaceous EECs may have been rapid, but in general, the EECs had a "pre" -history, during which the stage was set for environmental change. Negative feedback on the climate through increased marine LOM preservation was unlikely, because of the low overall organic-carbon accumulation rates during these episodes. Life and climate co-evolved during the Early Cretaceous. Arid conditions may have affected continental life, such as across the Tithonian/Berriasian boundary. Humid conditions and the corresponding tendency to develop dys- to anaerobic conditions in deeper ocean waters led to phases of accelerated extinction in oceans, but may have led to more luxuriant vegetation cover on continents, such as during the Valanginian, to the benefit of herbivores. During Early Cretaceous EECs, reef systems and carbonate platforms in general were particularly vulnerable. They were the first to disappear and the last to recover, often only after several million years. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Some species of sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are known to mediate the formation of dolomite and Mg-calcite. However, their exact role in the mineralization process remains elusive. Here, we present the result of a laboratory experiment that was designed to test whether formation of carbonate minerals by SRB can occur in the absence of living cells, through passive mineralization of their exopolymeric substances (EPS). SRB capable of mediating dolomite were cultivated in the laboratory, allowing them to secrete EPS. Microbial activity within the cultures was subsequently inhibited with antibiotics. Only after this step, Ca2+ and Mg2+ were added to the solution and carbonate minerals could form. Mg-calcite and disordered Ca-dolomite precipitated in association with EPS. The mol.{\%} of Mg2+ in the crystals increased with longer incubation times. This result demonstrates that organic compounds produced by SRB can mediate the formation of Ca-Mg carbonates in the absence of an active metabolism.},

@article{Mehra2018,
abstract = {The earliest metazoans capable of biomineralization appeared during the late Ediacaran Period (635-541 Ma) in strata associated with shallow water microbial reefs. It has been suggested that some Ediacaran microbial reefs were dominated (and possibly built) by an abundant and globally distributed tubular organism known as Cloudina. If true, this interpretation implies that metazoan framework reef building-a complex behavior that is responsible for some of the largest bioconstructions and most diverse environments in modern oceans-emerged much earlier than previously thought. Here, we present 3D reconstructions of Cloudina populations, produced using an automated serial grinding and imaging system coupled with a recently developed neural network image classifier. Our reconstructions show that Cloudina aggregates are composed of transported remains while detailed field observations demonstrate that the studied reef outcrops contain only detrital Cloudina buildups, suggesting that Cloudina played a minor role in Ediacaran reef systems. These techniques have wide applicability to problems that require 3D reconstructions where physical separation is impossible and a lack of density contrast precludes tomographic imaging techniques. Ediacaran | reefs | early life | three-dimensional reconstructions | biomineralization A lthough the Ediacara biota largely are preserved as soft-bodied impressions in fine-grained sediment (1), there are several biomineralizing metazoans within Ediacaran strata (2), chief among them the millimeter-to-centimeter-scale index fossil , Cloudina. Cloudina has been described as a gregarious, epibenthic, sessile suspension feeder (3, 4) that attached to microbial substrates through an apical end (5, 6) and that responded to environmental changes by altering its growth strategy (7). Researchers have suggested that Cloudina individuals , when found in aggregated clusters, exhibit preferred horizontal-to-subhorizontal-oriented growth (6). On the basis of field observations, workers have proposed that Cloudina may have produced calcified framework reefs some 20 Ma before the advent of the archaeocyathan buildups of the Lower Cam-brian (521 Ma, ref. 8), which are widely regarded to be the first metazoan-mediated reefs. In modern oceans, reefs built by metazoans comprise laterally extensive, organically formed wave-resistant structures that alter surrounding environments and contain high species biodiversity. Constraining the timing of the first metazoan-mediated reefs can provide insight into how (and perhaps why) the act of reef building emerged; the environmental conditions that cultivated such behavior; the evolutionary journey that led to both biomineralization and the construction of frameworks; and the effect such reefs had on ecology, evolution , sedimentology, and platform architecture. To determine whether Cloudina built reefs, in situ 3D information about the structure and orientation of individuals within aggregates is required. Rarely, Cloudina specimens are silicified or phosphatized and individual specimens can be isolated from the host rock for study via acid dissolution (9-11). However, most Cloudina remains are calcified and have similar physical properties to those of the surrounding limestone or dolomite matrix, precluding physical separation or the use of traditional computed tomography (CT) techniques. The inability to produce in situ 3D reconstructions has led researchers to make measurements of Cloudina individuals and aggregates on polished slabs, thin sections, and bedding planes (3, 4, 7). Unfortunately, as noted by previous researchers, 3D spatial and size distributions cannot be estimated from 2D cross-sections (12). Furthermore, synthetic experiments reveal that, in the case of tubular structures such as Cloudina, it is not possible to correctly infer orientation from 2D cross-sections (Fig. 1 A-C), and diameter measurements made on cross-sections through curved and/or elliptical tubes are subject to a large degree of error (as great as 35{\%}; Fig. 1 D and E). To address these issues, we serially ground, imaged, and traced Cloudina fossils using the Grinding Imaging Reconstruction Instrument (GIRI) at Princeton University (see Materials and Methods for discussion). Georeferenced observations, along with physical samples, were collected from three Ediacaran Cloudina-bearing reef systems: the pinnacle reef complex at Driedoornvlakte Farm near Reho-beth, Namibia (Figs. S1 and S2B); the patch and sheet microbial buildups at Zebra River Farm south of Naukluft, Namibia (Figs. S2B and S3); and recently exposed stromatolite bioherms on Salient Mountain in Canada (Figs. S2A, S4, and S5). Each outcrop was subject to a multiscale approach consisting of (i) kilometer-scale drone-assisted mapping to evaluate the extent of the reef; (ii) meter-scale, differential GPS-constrained stratigraphic and Significance Little is known about how the Ediacaran index fossil Cloudina lived and what impact it had on its surroundings. This uncertainty is due to the fact that Cloudina often is preserved with the same mineralogy as the rocks in which it is found; the lack of density contrast means that traditional imaging techniques cannot be used to reconstruct and measure in situ Cloudina populations. Recently, researchers have suggested that Cloud-ina was a framework reef builder that actively adapted to changing environmental conditions. In this paper, we use a serial grinding and imaging technique to produce 3D models of Cloudina aggregates. Along with detailed field observations , we demonstrate that Cloudina populations are detritus and not in situ growth. Published under the PNAS license.

abstract = {High-resolution uranium analyses as well as oxygen, carbon and strontium isotopes data through Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) in the marine sections of three offshore wells in Persian Gulf are illustrated in this paper. A decreasing trend in U content from Upper Permian strata toward the PTB is recorded in all wells. Such a trend could not be adequately explained by the facies changes, diagenetic events, salinity variations, dolomitization or total organic carbon (TOC) content of the samples.Distinct and negative uranium anomalies coincide with the onset of the carbon isotope shifts, which might indicate influx of anoxic waters. The Th/U ratios below the PTB in the studied sections are mainly less than 2, reinforcing this possibility. Reducing conditions associated with the anoxia would have gradually increased the rate of U fixation on the deep-sea floor, resulting in low U concentration in the shallow water carbonates.A negative $\delta$ 18O shift of about 4‰ could be seen at the PTB in all studied wells. Such excursion indicates a meteoric diagenesis below the boundary. Also, abnormally higher 87Sr/ 86Sr ratios below the PTB indicate significant input of radiogenic 87Sr during subaerial exposures at the end of Permian. This palaeoexposure surface is also reflected in depleted oxygen isotope values of this interval. Biostratigraphic studies also show that some important guide forms of Late Permian are absent in studied wells that could be due to several factors including non-sedimentation, subaerial exposure and erosion. Thus a near surface meteoric realm or emergent surface could be considered for the PTB in studied wells. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This study is based on zircon U-Pb ages of 12 volcanic ash layers and volcanogenic sandstones from two marine sections with conformable formational Permian-Triassic boundaries (PTB) in the Nanpanjiang Basin (South China). Our dates of single, thermally annealed and chemically abraded zircons bracket the PTB in Dongpan and Penglaitan and provide the basis for a first proof-of-concept study utilizing a Bayesian chronology model comparing the three sections of Dongpan, Penglaitan and the Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) Meishan. Our Bayesian modeling demonstrates that the formational boundaries in Dongpan (251.938{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.029{\&}thinsp;Ma), Penglaitan (251.982{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.031{\&}thinsp;Ma) and Meishan (251.956{\&}thinsp;±{\&}thinsp;0.033{\&}thinsp;Ma) are synchronous within analytical uncertainty of ca. 30{\&}thinsp;ka. It also provides quantitative evidence that the ages of the paleontologically defined boundaries, based on conodont Unitary Associations zones in Meishan and on macrofaunas in Dongpan, are identical and coincide with the age of the formational boundaries. The age model also confirms the extreme condensation around the PTB in Meishan, which distorts the projection of any stratigraphic points or intervals onto other more expanded sections by means of Bayesian age-depth models. Dongpan and Penglaitan possess significantly higher sedimentation rates and thus offer a greater potential for high resolution studies of environmental proxies and correlations around the PTB than Meishan. This study highlights the power of high-resolution radio-isotopic ages that allow a robust intercalibration of patterns of biotic changes and fluctuating environmental proxies and will help recognizing their global, regional or local significance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The overall model is now embedded into a new numerical code called NANOKIN, in which several optimization procedures have been introduced in order to allow long dynamics to be followed. NANOKIN was applied to the precipitation of Al- bearing minerals from aqueous solutions: halloysite, kaolinite and Ca-montmorillonite. It allowed us to propose a stable scheme for the competitive precipitation of halloysite and kaolinite under two different types of initial conditions: (1) a given initial super-saturation state of the aqueous solution; (2) progressive super-saturation resulting from the kinetic dissolution of the minerals from a granitic rock under weathering conditions. Both yield particle sizes in the micron range, but with distinct crystal size distribution functions.

The cores contain significant contents of organic matter comprising kerogen and bitumen of low to moderate thermal maturity. Extraction and analysis of the bitumens has revealed pat- terns of biomarker hydrocarbons consistent with marine deposition and photic zone euxinia. In particular isorenieratane and aryl isoprenoids, derived from the carotenoid pigments of green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae), are abundant and pervasive throughout the section and indicate that hydrogen sulfide must have been present in the photic zone for significant periods of time. These findings mirror the geochemical results obtained for other Permian–Triassic boundary sections of the Tethys realm (e.g. Western Australia, East Greenland and South China) and suggest that euxinic conditions prevailed widely, though perhaps periodically, and that hydrogen sulfide toxicity could have been an important factor in the extinction of marine invertebrates.},

abstract = {E investigate the role of nodes when a minimum dominating set (MDS) approach is considered in controlling a network. We present an algorithmic procedure to compute the critical and redundant nodes using the MDS. The theoretical analysis for scale-free networks shows that (1) high-degree nodes tend to be critical nodes and (2) for scaling exponent gamma{\textgreater}2, such probability increases when gamma grows. These relationships are confirmed by computer simulations. Furthermore, our computational experiments also show that the MDS is unimodal when the average degree left grows. It means that most nodes are redundant for high-degree, therefore one can achieve control through a small set of nodes, highlighting a centralized control feature. The analysis of a set of real-world networks confirms the findings observed in simulation experiments. In particular, the U.S. airport network shows a more centralized control, whereas the Italy's nationwide power grid network exhibits a more distributed control. The human protein-protein interaction network exerts control with a configuration between both man-made networks. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {When used in conjunction with trace metal redox proxies, the use of U/Mo ratios and ?? 95/95Mo values can considerably enhance the interpretation of ocean oxygenation trends both locally and globally. This is illustrated with studies from two, biogenic-chert dominated records of mass extinction: the Ordovician-Silurian boundary and the Late Permian in sections from the Yangtze Block in South China. The latest Ordovician mass extinction is well known to coincide with oxygenation episode in the Hirnantian Stage here revealed by trace metal proxies (V/V+Ni, V/Cr, Ni/Co) that show it sandwiched between anoxic/euxinic black shales. The predominantly anoxic/euxinic Ordovician-Silurian strata provide a record of seawater ?? 95/95Mo values that are seen to gradually rise during the interval from 0.5 to 1.0???. The exception to the ?? 98/95 Mo stability is the datum of the slight negatively ?? 98/95Mo, associated with decreasing of V/Cr and V/(V+Ni) ratio suggesting the Hirnantian oxygenation event. The Upper Permian chert succession at Shangsi reveals an overall better ventilated record in which the best oxygenated strata show the highest U/Mo values that is interpreted as relative enrichment of U in suboxic conditions. At a few levels anoxic/euxinic conditions show the ?? 95/95Mo values to be {\~{}}2???, close to modern values, implying that latest Permian oceans were as well ventilated as those today. The well-known end-Permian oceanic anoxic event is therefore suggested to only develop at the end of this period. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {Palynomorph distribution in Euramerica and western Gondwana, from the Latest Givetian to the Latest Famennian, may be explained, to some extent, by climatic changes. Detailed miospore stratigraphy dates accurately the successive steps of these changes. Interpretation is built on three postulates which are discussed: Euramerica at slightly lower latitudes than generally accepted by most paleomagnetic reconstructions: a conodont time-scale accepted as the most used available subdivision of time; and Late Devonian sea-level fluctuations mainly governed by glacio-eustasy. The Frasnian-Famennian timescale is also evaluated. The comparison, based on conodont correlations, between Givetian and most of the Frasnian miospore assemblages from, respectively, northern and southern Euramerica demonstrates a high taxonomic diversity in the equatorial belt and much difference between supposed equatorial and (sub) tropical vegetations. On the contrary, a similar vegetation pattern and therefore probably compatible climatic conditions were present from tropical to subpolar areas. A rather hot climate culminated during the Latest Frasnian when equatorial miospore assemblages reached their maximum width. The miospore diversity shows also a rather clear global Late Frasnian minimum which is also recorded during the Early and Middle Famennian but only in low latitude regions while, in high latitude, very cold climates without perennial snow may explain the scarcity of miospores and so of vegetation. The Early and Middle Famennian conspicuous latitudinal gradient of the vegetation seems to attenuate towards the Late and Latest Famennian but this might be above all the result of the development, of cosmopolitan coastal lowland vegetations (downstream swamps) depending more on the moisture and equable local microclimates than on the probably adverse climates of distant hinterland areas. During than time, periods of cold climate without perennial snow cover and with rare vegetation may have alternated with less cold but wetter climates, thus giving rise to the development of mountain glaciers in high latitudes and explaining the jerking character of the global major marine regression. In high latitude regions, the development of an ice cap reaching sea level is only recorded by the end of the Latest Famennian, immediately below the DCB but even if glacial evidence are not known at near the FFB, a short (0.1 Ma?) glaciation seems the best reasonable explanation of the major eustatic fall following the Kellwasser Event. The sudden growth and decay of a hypothetical. Earliest Famennian ice sheet can be explained by the reduction and later, increase in greenhouse capacity of the atmosphere. These changes in the atmospheric CO2 might have provoked changes in the mode of ocean-atmosphere operation. It may also be partly controlled by a volcanic paroxysm and/or bolide impacts. The Hony microtektites represent the best known evidence of the impact of extraterrestrial bodies on Earth corresponding to the UKW and they are immediately followed by a regression suggested by the quantitative analysis of acritarch assemblages. In the paleo-tropical Late Famennian a peat-forming vascular plant community occurs for the first time and makes possible quantitative palynology of autochthonous sediments allowing the recognition of different swamp and near-swamp characteristic miospores. The early Latest Famennian starts with a widespread transgression which could correspond to the melting phases of the hypothetical Late Famennian mountain glaciers. During the end-Famennian the coastal lowland vegetation has a worldwide distribution from sub-polar to equatorial regions. The climate has become less cold in high latitudes but wetter than before probably because the midlatitude cyclonic activity allows sufficient polar transportation of moisture to form large snow cover. Extensive coastal glaciers developed in different Bolivian and Brazilian basins, well dated by miospores. Rapid climatic changes characterize the onset of glaciation. The cyclic nature of climate allowed even intertropical marine faunas to reach occasionally the subpolar regions. For the plant kingdom, the crisis which follows the Hangenberg Event was more severe than the Late Frasnian Crisis. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Periods of oceanic anoxia have had a major influence on the evolutionary history of Earth and are often contemporaneous with mass extinction events. Changes in global (as opposed to local) redox conditions can be potentially evaluated using U system proxies. The intensity and timing of oceanic redox changes associated with the end-Permian extinction horizon (EH) were assessed from variations in (238)U/(235)U ($\delta$(238)U) and Th/U ratios in a carbonate section at Dawen in southern China. The EH is characterized by shifts toward lower $\delta$(238)U values (from -0.37‰ to -0.65‰), indicative of an expansion of oceanic anoxia, and higher Th/U ratios (from 0.06 to 0.42), indicative of drawdown of U concentrations in seawater. Using a mass balance model, we estimate that this isotopic shift represents a sixfold increase in the flux of U to anoxic facies, implying a corresponding increase in the extent of oceanic anoxia. The intensification of oceanic anoxia coincided with, or slightly preceded, the EH and persisted for an interval of at least 40,000 to 50,000 y following the EH. These findings challenge previous hypotheses of an extended period of whole-ocean anoxia prior to the end-Permian extinction.},

abstract = {The Mn distribution in Panama Basin area sediments and interstitial waters is discussed. Striking surficial Mn enrichments produced by a well-known diagenetic recycling process characterize the sediments of the region. Thermodynamic solubility calculations indicate that in at least one core interstitial waters approach saturation with respect to MnCO3. A mixed carbonate phase of composition (Mn48 Ca47 Mg5)CO3 was recovered from an ash band in the same core. The association of this material with the coarse volcaniclastic debris is thought to result from facile manganous carbonate precipitation in sediment horizons of coarser mean grain size. Since sulphate reduction in the upper two metres of Panama Basin sediments is fairly minor, little increase in alkalinity is observed, and it is postulated that significant production of carbonate alkalinity is not a prerequisite for manganous carbonate generation in hemipelagic sediments. A more important factor appears to be the availability of Mn oxides for solution during early diagenesis. Stable C isotopic analyses indicate that little C of organic origin is used in the precipitation reaction in either Panama Basin or Loch Fyne (Scotland) sediments.},

abstract = {The MEDIA (Modelling Early DIAgenesis) software package comprises a flexible and extensible software system that provides problem-solving assistance for simulating 1D reactive transport in surface sediments. MEDIA allows multiple diagenetic models to be built by extending a model template with new model components from a toolbox of available objects (elements, species, parameters, reactions). A detailed review is given of the transport and reaction components available for model construction. Upon assemblage, the model is channelled to the numerical subunit of the MEDIA package. Via a canonical transformation, the user-defined mixed kinetic-equilibrium model is rearranged into a proper set of differential algebraic equations (DAE), for which both steady state and transient solutions can be calculated. Steady-state profiles are obtained either directly using a Newton-Raphson method, or alternatively, as the asymptotic result of a dynamic simulation. Dynamic simulations involve a global implicit procedure based on the stiff- ODE solver package VODE, employing a direct substitution approach to reduce the number of equations in the DAE system. Verification of the MEDIA code was accomplished (1) by comparison with analytic models and (2) by emulating the model formulation and output of the existing diagenetic model code STEADYSED. As an example application, a diagenetic model was constructed to analyse an extensive dataset collected from a marine sediment in the Santa Barbara Basin (California). The different pathways of organic matter mineralization were modelled, and the coupling among the biogeochemical cycles of C, O, N, S, Mn and Fe was investigated. Depth profiles of both porewater and solid-phase constituents could be reproduced with great accuracy},

abstract = {An extension of the seawater secular-variation model that successfully predicted the observed timing of Phanerozoic MgSO4 vs. KCl marine evaporites and aragonite seas vs. calcite seas has been applied to the prediction of the secular variations in the major ion chemistry of seawater and aragonite seas vs. calcite seas during the Precambrian. Testing of the predictions was based on those Precambrian seafloor carbonate precipitates that have been interpreted by others to have formed originally as aragonite. Of 16 examples of Precambrian seafloor aragonite, 14 fall within the 6 periods of aragonite seas predicted for the Late Archean-Proterozoic by the model, 1 falls on the transition between an aragonite sea and calcite sea, and 1 falls in a period of calcite seas. This strong correlation supports the following predictions of the model: (1) Precambrian seawater was a saline NaCl water with Ca {\textgreater} HCO3 since at least the Late Archean. (2) The major ion compositions of Precambrian seawater chemistry and their secular variations are in the same ranges as those of Phanerozoic seawater. (3) The Mg/Ca mole ratio in seawater has controlled the types of CaCO3 polymorphs that have precipitated from Earth's oceans throughout the Phanerozoic and most, if not all, of the Precambrian.},

abstract = {The Much Wenlock Limestone Formation of the West Midlands was deposited in a mid-shelf setting and is divisible into three members; the Upper and Lower Quarried Limestone members being separated by the more argillaceous Nodular Limestone Member. Oncoids, composed predominantly of micritic fabrics with Rothpletzella and Girvanella, occur commonly in the Lower Quarried Limestone Member. These oncoids vary from subspherical bodies up to 5 mm in diameter to forms with a highly irregular and branched upper surface which reach 70 mm across. Each form is indicative of a different depositional environment, which is also reflected in the sediment enclosing the oncoid. Equidimensional oncoids in peloidal packstones were formed by continuous rolling, whereas the larger, branched forms enclosed in loosely packed wackestones developed in quieter conditions below wave base. The distribution of oncoid morphotypes in the Lower Quarried Limestone Member shows that small variations in relative sea level were superimposed on the overall middle to late Wenlock regressive episode during which the Much Wenlock Limestone Formation was deposited. The uniformity of the formation throughout the West Midlands indicates that the sea floor was essentially planar over a large area. Vertical variation of oncoid morphology within the Lower Quarried Limestone Member can be traced throughout the area, allowing accurate correlation of relative sea-level variations.},

abstract = {In post-Cambrian time, five events—the end-Ordovician, end-Frasnian in the Late Devonian, end-Permian, end-Triassic, and end-Cretaceous—are commonly grouped as the ‘‘big five'' global intervals of mass extinction. Plotted by magnitude, extinction intensities for all Phanerozoic substages show a continuous distribution, with the five traditionally recognized mass extinctions located in the upper tail. Plotted by time, however, proportional extinctions clearly divide the Phanerozoic Eon into six stratigraphically coherent intervals of alternating high and low extinction in- tensity. These stratigraphic neighborhoods provide a temporal context for evaluating the intensity of extinction during the ‘‘big five'' events. Compared with other stages and substages in the same neighborhood, only the end-Ordovician, end-Permian, and end-Cretaceous extinction intensities appear as outliers. Moreover, when origination and extinction are considered together, only these three of the ‘‘big five'' events appear to have been generated exclusively by elevated extinction. Low origination contributed more than high extinction to the marked loss of diversity in the late Frasnian and at the end of the Triassic. Therefore, whereas the ‘‘big five'' events are clearly times when diversity suffered mass depletion, only those at the end of theOrdovician, Permian, and Cretaceous periods unequivocally qualify as globally distinct mass extinctions. Each of the three has a unique pattern of extinction, and the diversity dynamics of these events differ, as well, from the other two major diversity depletions. As mass depletions of diversity have no common effect, common causation seems unlikely.},

2- during reaction of phosphoric acid with natural smithsonite (ZnCO3) and cerussite (PbCO3) has been determined between 25 and 72??C. While cerussite decomposes in phosphoric acid within a few hours at 25??C, smithsonite reacts very slowly with the acid at 25??C providing yields of CO2 {\textless} 25{\%} after 2 weeks. The low yields result in a low precision for oxygen isotope measurements of the acid-liberated CO2 (??1.65???, 1??, n = 9). The yield and reproducibility of oxygen isotope values of the acid-liberated CO2 from smithsonite can be improved, the latter to ?????0.15???, by increasing the reaction temperature to 50??C for 12 h or to 72??C for 1 h. Our new phosphoric acid fractionation factor for natural cerussite at 25??C deviates significantly from a previously published value on synthetic material. The temperature dependence of the oxygen isotope factionation factor, ?? between acid-liberated CO2 and carbonate at 25 to 72??C is given by the following equations 1000ln?? phosCO2-cerussite = 5.13 (??0.15) + 4.79 (??0.15) ?? 105/T2 1000ln?? phosCO2-smithsonite = 3.96 (??0.21) + 6.69 (??0.22) ?? 105/T2 with temperature T in kelvin. A comparison with published equations of the form 1000ln??phosCO2-carbonate = A + B ?? 105/T2 for other divalent metal carbonates shows that the factors B of slowly-reacting carbonates from the rhombohedral calcite group (magnesite, siderite, smithsonite and rhodochrosite) are very similar (6.7 ?? 0.2) and distinct from those of fast-reacting minerals witherite, cerussite, and strontianite of the orthorhombic aragonite group (4.5 ?? 0.3) and calcite (5.6 ?? 0.1). These differences indicate a crystallographic control on the temperature dependence of the kinetic oxygen isotope fractionation between phosphoric acid liberated CO2 and carbonate. ?? 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

The unusual behavior of the carbon cycle coincides with the delayed recovery from end-Permian extinction recorded by fossils, suggesting a direct relationship between Earth system function and biological rediversification in the aftermath of Earth's most devastating mass extinction.},

abstract = {Two Fe(III)-modified montmorillonites were synthesized by mixing Fe(III) nitrate solutions with montmorillonite at pH 3.5 followed by an increase in pH up to 9. The synthesis procedure was analyzed by solubility calculations and Fe(III) speciation in aqueous solutions, and the resulting solids were characterized by X-ray diffraction, specific surface area, M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy, electrophoretic mobilities (EM) and phosphate adsorption. At low pH, iron concentration in solution during the synthesis is controlled by adsorption/intercalation reactions, whereas at high pH the concentration is controlled by the solubility of ferrihydrite. When the initial Fe(III) content is relatively low the synthesized solid contains mainly interlayer/sorbed Fe(III). When the initial Fe(III) content is relatively high the synthesized solid contains also some iron (hydr)oxide phases, mainly ferrihydrite. These Fe(III) phases are in close contact with montmorillonite, either coating the montmorillonite surface or aggregated with montmorillonite particles. The presence of Fe(III) species increases significantly the specific surface area and phosphate adsorption capacity, but changes only slightly the EM of the solid.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Geological Society of America. The late Maastrichtian warming event was defined by a global temperature increase of {\~{}}2.5-5 °C that occurred {\~{}}150-300 k.y. before the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction. This transient warming event has traditionally been associated with a major pulse of Deccan Traps (west-central India) volcanism; however, large uncertainties associated with radiogenic dating methods have long hampered a definitive correlation. Here we present a new high-resolution, single species, benthic stable isotope record from the South Atlantic, calibrated to an updated orbitally tuned age model, to provide a revised chronology of the event, which we then correlate to the latest radiogenic dates of the main Deccan Traps eruption phases. Our data reveal that the initiation of deep-sea warming coincides, within uncertainty, with the onset of the main phase of Deccan volcanism, strongly suggesting a causal link. The onset of deep-sea warming is synchronous with a 405 k.y. eccentricity minimum, excluding a control by orbital forcing alone, although amplified carbon cycle sensitivity to orbital precession is evident during the greenhouse warming. A more precise understanding of Deccan-induced climate change paves the way for future work focusing on the fundamental role of these precursor climate shifts in the K-Pg mass extinction.},

However, visually imperceptible processes can alter these proxies during sediment burial. Here, we investigate the diffusion-controlled re-equilibration process with experiments exposing foraminifera tests to elevated pressures and temperatures in isotopically heavy artificial seawater (H2 18O), followed by scanning electron microscopy and quantitative NanoSIMS imaging: oxygen-isotope compositions changed heterogeneously at submicrometer length scales without any observable modifications of the test ultrastructures. In parallel, numerical modelling of diffusion during burial shows that oxygen-isotope re-equilibration of fossil foraminifera tests can cause significant overestimations of ocean paleotemperatures on a time scale of 107 years under natural conditions. Our results suggest that the late Cretaceous and Paleogene deep-ocean and high-latitude surface-ocean temperatures were significantly lower than is generally accepted, thereby explaining the paradox of the low equator-to-pole surface-ocean thermal gradient inferred for these periods.},

abstract = {We present a numerical model of sedimentary early diagenetic processes that includes oxic and anoxic mineralization. The model belongs to the new wave of early diagenesis models that account for depth-dependent bioturbation and porosity profiles; it can be used both for calculating steady-state conditions and transient simulation. It was developed to reproduce the cycling of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen along the ocean margin; it resolves the sediment-depth profiles of carbon, oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, and other reduced substances. Organic carbon is modeled as two degradable fractions with different first-order degradation rates and nitrogen:carbon ratios, to account for the decreasing reactivity and N/C ratio of the organic matter with depth into the sediment. The consumption of oxygen and nitrate as terminal electron acceptors is explicitly modeled, and mineralization is limited both by carbon (first order kinetics) and by oxidant availability (Michaelis-Menten type kinetics). Nitrification and oxic mineralization are decoupled, which allows the description of ammonium profiles. Mineralization processes using other oxidants (manganese oxides, iron oxides, sulphate) are lumped into one process, where degradation is only carbon limited; the terminal electron acceptors are not explicitly modeled, only the production of reduced substances is described. These substances are in part permanently removed (e.g., pyrite formation below the bioturbation zone) and partly diffuse towards the oxic layer where they react with oxygen. The values of several parameters were constrained using literature-derived relationships. The model was calibrated on a dataset obtained from the literature, which relates the magnitude of the different pathways to total organic carbon mineralization. The influence of carbon flux, bioturbation, sedimentation rate, bottomwater concentrations of oxygen, and nitrate and carbon degradability on the different mineralization pathways is examined. The relative contribution of the oxic mineralization in the model is significantly depressed under high organic flux, under low bottomwater oxygen conditions and when the bioturbation increases; higher carbon degradability has only a small positive effect, while sedimentation rate is relatively unimportant. Denitrification is mainly influenced by the nitrate concentration in the overlying bottomwater.},

abstract = {The oxidation of Earth's atmosphere is coupled to the net sequestration of organic matter, which is related to the relative fractions of organic carbon (forg) and carbonate (fcarb) buried in marine sediments. These fractions can be inferred from carbon isotope data. We present bulk sediment $\delta$13C records of carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarb) and organic carbon ($\delta$13Corg) with a compilation of evolutionary trajectories of major eucaryotic phytoplankton for the past 205 million years. Our analysis indicates that changes in phytoplankton community structure, coupled with the opening of the Atlantic Ocean basin and global sea-level rise, increased the efficiency of organic carbon burial beginning in the Early Jurassic; in turn, this organic carbon burial increased the oxidation state of Earth's surface while drawing down atmospheric CO2levels (assuming no substantial negative feedbacks). The net oxidation and CO2drawdown appear to be related to the opening phase of the current Wilson cycle, where the newly formed passive plate margins store organic matter for hundreds of millions of years. This process should reverse during the closing phase of the Wilson cycle, when the continents reassemble and the Atlantic Ocean basin closes. The associated oxidation and storage of organic matter have contributed to the long-term depletion of CO2, which was a key factor that selected C4photosynthetic pathways in marine and terrestrial ecosystems in the latter part of the Cenozoic; these pathways increasingly influenced $\delta$13Corg, and ultimately contributed to the reversal of the long-term trend in $\delta$13Ccarb. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The macroevolutionary effects of extinction derive from both intensity of taxonomic losses and selectivity of losses with respect to ecology, physiology and/or higher taxonomy. Increasingly, palaeontologists are using logistic regression to quantify extinction selectivity because the selectivity metric is independent of extinction intensity and multiple predictor variables can be assessed simultaneously. We illustrate the use of logistic regression with an analysis of physiological buffering capacity and extinction risk in the Phanerozoic marine fossil record. We propose the geometric mean of extinction intensity and selectivity as a metric for the influence of extinction events. The end-Permian mass extinction had the largest influence on the physiological composition of the fauna owing to its combination of high intensity and strong selectivity. In addition to providing a quantitative measure of influence to compare among past events, this approach provides an avenue for quantifying the risk posed by the emerging biodiversity crisis that goes beyond a simple projection of taxonomic losses.},

@article{Leavitt2013,
abstract = {Phanerozoic levels of atmospheric oxygen relate to the burial histories of organic carbon and pyrite sulfur. The sulfur cycle remains poorly constrained, however, leading to concomitant uncertainties in O2 budgets. Here we present experiments linking the magnitude of fractionations of the multiple sulfur isotopes to the rate of microbial sulfate reduction. The data demonstrate that such fractionations are controlled by the availability of electron donor (organic matter), rather than by the concentration of electron acceptor (sulfate), an environmental constraint that varies among sedimentary burial environments. By coupling these results with a sediment biogeochemical model of pyrite burial, we find a strong relationship between observed sulfur isotope fractionations over the last 200 Ma and the areal extent of shallow seafloor environments. We interpret this as a global dependency of the rate of microbial sulfate reduction on the availability of organic-rich sea-floor settings. However, fractionation during the early/mid-Paleozoic fails to correlate with shelf area. We suggest that this decoupling reflects a shallower paleoredox boundary, primarily confined to the water column in the early Phanerozoic. The transition between these two states begins during the Carboniferous and concludes approximately around the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, indicating a prolonged response to a Carboniferous rise in O2. Together, these results lay the foundation for decoupling changes in sulfate reduction rates from the global average record of pyrite burial, highlighting how the local nature of sedimentary processes affects global records. This distinction greatly refines our understanding of the S cycle and its relationship to the history of atmospheric oxygen.},

Atmospheric pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was near 4500 ppm in the late Carnian, decreasing to below -2000 ppm by the late Rhaetian just before the earliest Jurassic eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, which triggered measurable pulses of CO2 outgassing. These data are consistent with published modeling results using the GEOCLIM model, which predict a decrease in pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} over the Late Triassic as a result of the progressive increase in continental area subject to the intense weathering regime of the tropical humid belt due to Pangea's northward motion. The finer-scale pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} changes we observe may be dependent on the lithology introduced to the tropics, such as the dip to -2000 ppm around 212 Ma and its rebound to -4000 ppm at 209 Ma, which can be accomplished by introducing a more weatherable subaerial basaltic terrain. These observations indicate that the consumption of CO2 by continental silicate weathering can force long-term changes in pCO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} comparable to those driven by presumed changes in mantle degassing.},

abstract = {Modern Rhynchonellida, Terebratulida, Thecideida and a few inarticulated brachiopods were collected live or soon after death at 30 locations from depths of 2-3940 m, from the equator to high latitudes covering the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Caribbean and Mediterranean Oceans/Seas. Well-preserved fibers of the secondary layer combined with Sr (450-1928 mg/kg), Mn (1-199 mg/kg) and Fe (1-610 mg/kg) contents confirm, with few exceptions, the excellent preservation of the modern brachiopod material. Evaluation of the stable isotope compositions was conducted on 276 specimens and on 374 published samples for a total database of 650 samples from 80 locations. It revealed that oxygen isotope incorporation into shell calcite (secondary layer) of modern articulated brachiopods, in most cases, occurs in equilibrium with the ambient water and as such reflects surrounding environmental conditions. Thecideida as a group (shallow water and low latitude) incorporate oxygen isotopes (-3.04‰ to +0.35‰) into shell calcite in equilibrium with their ambient water. A large majority of genera and species of the Terebratulida (shallow water and low-mid latitude) also incorporate oxygen (-2.30‰ to +3.48‰) into shell calcite in isotopic equilibrium with their surrounding water. In contrast, equilibrium incorporation of oxygen isotopes into shell calcite by the Rhynchonellida is uncertain, but a vital effect probably applies to the Craniida. The question of equilibrium/disequilibrium incorporation of carbon isotopes into shell calcite of modern brachiopods remains unresolved at this time. Isotope compositions range up to 4.5‰, 5.6‰ and 1.5‰ for $\delta$13C, and up to 5.5‰, 5.9‰ and 0.3‰ for $\delta$18O, for shallow-water low, mid, and high latitude brachiopods, respectively. Strontium isotopes of modern brachiopods, as expected, show no significant variation with location, latitude, water depth, temperature, salinity and general water conditions. Once local habitat and ecological influences of fossil brachiopods from similar latitudes are considered, their isotopic/elemental values should be valuable diagenetic indicators and important oceanographic/chemostratigraphic proxies. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Recent advances in our understanding of conodont palaeobiology and functional morphology have rendered established hypotheses of element growth untenable. In order to address this problem, hard tissue histology is reviewed paying particular attention to the relationships during growth of the component hard tissues comprising conodont elements, and ignoring a priori assumptions of the homologies of these tissues. Conodont element growth is considered further in terms of the pattern of formation, of which four distinct types are described, all possibly derived from a primitive condition after heterochronic changes in the timing of various developmental stages. It is hoped that this may provide further means of unravelling conodont phylogeny. The manner in which the tissues grew is considered homologous with other vertebrate hard tissues, and the elements appear to have grown in a way similar to the growing scales and growing dentition of other vertebrates.},

abstract = {Mass extinctions documented by the fossil record provide critical benchmarks for assessing changes through time in biodiversity and ecology. Efforts to compare biotic crises of the past and present, however, encounter difficulty because taxonomic and ecological changes are decoupled, and although various metrics exist for describing taxonomic turnover, no methods have yet been proposed to quantify the ecological impacts of extinction events. To address this issue, we apply a network-based approach to exploring the evolution of marine animal communities over the Phanerozoic Eon. Network analysis of fossil co-occurrence data enables us to identify nonrandom associations of interrelated paleocommunities. These associations, or evolutionary paleocommunities, dominated total diversity during successive intervals of relative community stasis. Community turnover occurred largely during mass extinctions and radiations, when ecological reorganization resulted in the decline of one association and the rise of another. Altogether, we identify five evolutionary paleocommunities at the generic and familial levels in addition to three ordinal associations that correspond to Sepkoski's Cambrian, Paleozoic, and Modern evolutionary faunas. In this context, we quantify magnitudes of ecological change by measuring shifts in the representation of evolutionary paleocommunities over geologic time. Our work shows that the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event had the largest effect on ecology, followed in descending order by the Permian–Triassic, Cretaceous–Paleogene, Devonian, and Triassic–Jurassic mass extinctions. Despite its taxonomic severity, the Ordovician extinction did not strongly affect co-occurrences of taxa, affirming its limited ecological impact. Network paleoecology offers promising approaches to exploring ecological consequences of extinctions and radiations.},

@article{Ridgwell2003,
abstract = {1 One of the most elegant mechanisms forwarded for late Quaternary atmospheric CO2 variability concerns the sensitivity of calcium carbonate preservation in deep ocean sediments to the relative delivery rates of calcium carbonate and particulate organic carbon (the CaCO3: POC "rain ratio''). It was implicitly assumed that any change in the CaCO3: POC rain ratio of biogenic material produced in the surface ocean will be communicated directly to the sediments. This would allow relatively subtle shifts in ecosystem composition to affect sedimentary CaCO3 preservation and thus atmospheric CO2). However, recent research into the controls on the transport of POC to depth suggests that the rain ratio "seen'' by the sediments may instead be buffered against any perturbation occurring at the surface. This casts doubt on the viability of hypotheses envisaging ecological changes as a means of accounting for the observed glacial-interglacial CO2 signal.},

abstract = {Comparison of rates of accumulation of organic carbon in surface marine sediments from the central North Pacific, the continental margins off northwest Africa, northwest and southwest America, the Argentine Basin, and the western Baltic Sea with primary production rates suggests that the fraction of primary produced organic carbon preserved in the sediments is universally related to the bulk sedimentation rate. Accordingly, less than 0.01{\%} of the primary production becomes fossilized in slowly accumulating pelagic sediments [(2 to 6 mm (1000 y)-1] of the Central Pacific, 0.1 to 2{\%} in moderately rapidly accumulating [2 to 13 cm (1000 y)-1] hemipelagic sediments off northwest Africa, northwest America (Oregon) and southeast America (Argentina), and 11 to 18{\%} in rapidly accumulating [66 to 140 cm (1000 y)-1] hemipelagic sediments off southwest America (Peru) and in the Baltic Sea. The emiprical expression: {\%}Org-C= 0.0030?? R ?? S 0.30 ps(1-??) implies that the sedimentary organic carbon content ({\%} Org-C) doubles with each 10-fold increase in sedimentation rate (S), assuming that other factors remain constant; i.e., primary production (R), porosity (??) and sediment density (ps). This expression also predicts the sedimentary organic carbon content from the primary production rate, sedimentation rate, dry density of solids, and their porosity; it may be used to estimate paleoproductivity as well. Applying this relationship to a sediment core from the continental rise off northwest Africa (Spanish Sahara) suggests that productivity there during interglacial oxygen isotope stages 1 and 5 was about the same as today but was higher by a factor of 2 to 3 during glacial stages 2, 3, and 6. ?? 1979.},

abstract = {Earth scientists have had no direct way of calculating longitudes for times before those of the oldest hotspot track eruption sites in the Cretaceous ({\~{}} 130??Myr ago). For earlier times palaeomagnetic data constrain only ancient latitudes and continental rotations. We have recently devised a hybrid plate motion reference frame that permits the calculation of longitude back to Pangean assembly at {\~{}} 320??Ma. This reference frame, here corrected for True Polar Wander (TPW), places most reconstructed Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) of the past 300??Myr radially above the edges of the Large Low Shear wave Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) in Earth's lowermost mantle. This remarkable correlation between surface and deep mantle features, which is also discernible for all hotspots with a deep-plume origin, provides a new way of reconstructing the original positions of LIP sites, and therefore the position of continents whose longitudes have hitherto been unknown. We place the 258??Ma Emeishan LIP eruption of South China at 4??N and 140??E, in that way constraining the width and the geometry of the Palaeotethys Ocean during the Late Permian. If LLSVPs have remained stable for even longer and TPW has been small, we can, under these assumptions, also restore Siberia and Gondwana longitudinally for Late Devonian ({\~{}} 360??Ma) and Late Cambrian ({\~{}} 510??Ma) times. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about how mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions could reduce biodiversity impacts, particularly amongst common and widespread species. Our global analysis of future climatic range change of common and widespread species shows that without mitigation, 57 +/- 6{\%} of plants and 34 +/- 7{\%} of animals are likely to lose {\textgreater}= 50{\%} of their present climatic range by the 2080s. With mitigation, however, losses are reduced by 60{\%} if emissions peak in 2016 or 40{\%} if emissions peak in 2030. Thus, our analyses indicate that without mitigation, large range contractions can be expected even amongst common and widespread species, amounting to a substantial global reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services by the end of this century. Prompt and stringent mitigation, on the other hand, could substantially reduce range losses and buy up to four decades for climate change adaptation.},

abstract = {Multiple levels of earthquake-induced soft-sediment deformations (seismites) are concentrated in the end-Triassic mass extinction interval across Europe. The repetitive nature of the seismites rules out an origin by an extraterrestrial impact. Instead, this intense seismic activity is linked to the formation of the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP). By the earliest Jurassic the seismic activity had ceased, while extrusive volcanism still continued and biotic recovery was on its way. This suggests that magmatic intrusions into sedimentary strata during early stages of CAMP formation caused emission of gases (SO2, halocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) that may have played a major part in the biotic crisis.},

Taxa that have less than or equal to 15 {\%} stratigraphic abundance (percent of sample intervals in which a taxon occurs) show last occurrences well before that level, whereas taxa,vith more complete records tend to disappear at or close to that level. These results are in agreement with simulations for abrupt extinctions, as opposed to gradual or steplike extinction scenarios, and support predictions of the Signor-Lipps effect, that errors in the end points of biostratigraphic ranges can produce range truncations and apparent gradual decline preceding a sudden extinction boundary. On the basis of estimated sedimentation rates for the Italian sections, the end-Permian extinctions could have been very sudden (less than or equal to 30 k.y.), and the disappearance of most latest Permian foraminifers was most likely coincident with a world wide ecological stress event, identified by a global negative delta(13)C anomaly that Occurs in Italy near the base or within the time-transgressive Tesero horizon.},

abstract = {Deposits produced by microbial growth and metabolism have been important components of carbonate sediments since the Archaean. Geologically best known in seas and lakes, microbial carbonates are also important at the present day in fluviatile, spring, cave and soil environments. The principal organisms involved are bacteria, particularly cyanobacteria, small algae and fungi, that participate in the growth of microbial biofilms and mats. Grain-trapping is locally important, but the key process is precipitation, producing reefal accumulations of calcified microbes and enhancing mat accretion and preservation. Various metabolic processes, such as photosynthetic uptake of CO2 and/or HCO3- by cyanobacteria, and ammonification, denitrification and sulphate reduction by other bacteria, can increase alkalinity and stimulate carbonate precipitation. Extracellular polymeric substances, widely produced by microbes for attachment and protection, are important in providing nucleation sites and facilitating sediment trapping. Microbial carbonate microfabrics are heterogeneous. They commonly incorporate trapped particles and in situ algae and invertebrates, and crystals form around bacterial cells, but the main component is dense, clotted or peloidal micrite resulting from calcification of bacterial cells, sheaths and biofilm, and from phytoplankton-stimulated whiting nucleation. Interpretation of these texturally convergent and often inscrutable fabrics is a challenge. Conspicuous accumulations are large domes and columns with laminated (stromatolite), clotted (thrombolite) and other macrofabrics, which may be either agglutinated or mainly composed of calcified or spar-encrusted microbes. Stromatolite lamination appears to be primary, but clotted thrombolite fabrics can be primary or secondary. Microbial precipitation also contributes to hot-spring travertine, cold-spring mound, calcrete, cave crust and coated grain deposits, as well as influencing carbonate cementation, recrystallization and replacement. Microbial carbonate is biologically stimulated but also requires favourable saturation state in ambient water, and thus relies uniquely on a combination of biotic and abiotic factors. This overriding environmental control is seen at the present day by the localization of microbial carbonates in calcareous streams and springs and in shallow tropical seas, and in the past by temporal variation in abundance of marine microbial carbonates. Patterns of cyanobacterial calcification and microbial dome formation through time appear to reflect fluctuations in seawater chemistry. Stromatolites appeared at similar to 3450 Ma and were generally diverse and abundant from 2800 to 1000 Ma. Inception of a Proterozoic decline, variously identified at 2000, 1000 and 675 Ma, has been attributed to eukaryote competition and/or reduced lithification. Thrombolites and dendrolites mainly formed by calcified cyanobacteria became important early in the Palaeozoic, and reappeared in the Late Devonian. Microbial carbonates retained importance through much of the Mesozoic, became scarcer in marine environments in the Cenozoic, but locally re-emerged as large agglutinated domes, possibly reflecting increased algal involvement, and thick micritic reef crusts in the late Neogene. Famous modern examples at Shark Bay and Lee Stocking Island are composite coarse agglutinated domes and columns with complex bacterial-algal mats occurring in environments that are both stressed and current-swept: products of mat evolution, ecological refugia, sites of enhanced early lithification or all three?},

abstract = {The pattern and causes of Permo/Triassic biotic crisis were mainly documented by faunal and terrestrial plant records. We reviewed herein the geomicrobiological perspective on this issue based on the reported cyanobacterial record. Two episodic cyanobacterial blooms were observed to couple with carbon isotope excursions and faunal mass extinction at Meishan section, suggestive of the presence of at least two episodic biotic crises across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). The two episodes of cyanobacterial blooms, carbon isotope excursions and faunal mass extinction were, respectively, identified in several sections of the world, inferring the presence of two global changes across the PTB. Close associations among the three records (cyanobacterial bloom, shift in carbon isotope composition, and faunal extinction) were subsequently observed in three intervals in the Early Triassic, the protracted recovery period as previously thought, inferring the occurrence of more episodes of global changes. Spatiotemporal association of cyanobacterial blooms with volcanic materials in South China, and probably in South-east Asia, infers their causal relationship. Volcanism is believed to trigger the biotic crisis in several ways and to cause the close association among microbial blooms, the carbon isotope excursions and faunal mass extinctions in four intervals from the latest Permian to the Early Triassic. The major episodes of the well-known Siberian flood eruption are proposed to be responsible for the extinctions in the Early Triassic, but their synchronicity with the end-Permian extinction awaits more precise dating data to confirm. Geomicrobial records are thus suggestive of a long-term episodic biotic crisis (at least four episodes) lasting from the latest Permian to the end of the Early Triassic, induced by the global volcanic eruptions and sea level changes during Pangea formation.},

abstract = {In soils, mycorrhiza (microscopic fungal hypha) living in symbiosis with plant roots are the biological interface by which plants obtain, from rocks and organic matter, the nutrients necessary for their growth and maintenance. Despite their central role in soils, the mechanism and kinetics of mineral alteration by mycorrhiza are poorly constrained quantitatively. Here, we report in situ quantification of weathering rates from a mineral substrate, (001) basal plane of biotite, by a surface-bound hypha of Paxillus involutus, grown in association with the root system of a Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris. Four thin-sections were extracted by focused ion beam (FIB) milling along a single hypha grown over the biotite surface. Depth-profile of Si, O, K, Mg, Fe and Al concentrations were performed at the hypha-biotite interface by scanning transmission electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (STEM-EDX). Large removals of K (50-65{\%}), Mg (55-75{\%}), Fe (80-85{\%}) and Al (75-85{\%}) were observed in the topmost 40nm of biotite underneath the hypha while Si and O are preserved throughout the depth-profile. A quantitative model of alteration at the hypha-scale was developed based on solid-state diffusion fluxes of elements into the hypha and the break-down/mineralogical re-arrangement of biotite. A strong acidification was also observed with hypha bound to the biotite surface reaching pH{\textless}4.6. When consistently compared with the abiotic biotite dissolution, we conclude that the surface-bound mycorrhiza accelerate the biotite alteration kinetics between pH 3.5 and 5.8 to ∼0.04$\mu$molbiotitem-2h-1. Our current work reaffirms that fungal mineral alteration is a process that combines our previously documented bio-mechanical forcing with the $\mu$m-scale acidification mediated by surface-bound hypha and a subsequent chemical element removal due to the fungal action. As such, our study presents a first kinetic framework for mycorrhizal alteration at the hypha-scale under close-to-natural experimental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The TRIS includes both Acid Volatile Sulfide (AVS: H2S + FeS) and the remaining Chromium Reducible Sulfur (CRS: S?, FeS2). The single-step distillation was simpler and faster than the consecutive distillations of AVS and CRS. It also resulted in higher (4-50{\%}) sulfate reduction rates than those obtained from the sum of 35S in AVS and CRS. The difference was largest when the sediment had been dried after AVS but before CRS distillation. Relative to the 35S-AVS distillation alone, the 35S-TRIS single-step distallation yielded 8-87{\%} higher reduction rates. The separation and recovery of FeS, SO and FeS2 was studied under three distillation conditions: 1) cold acid, 2) cold acid with Cr2+, and 3) hot acid with Cr2+. The FeS was recovered by cold acid alone while pyrite was recovered by cold acid with Cr2+. A smaller S? fraction, presumably of the finer crystal sizes, was recovered also in the cold acid with Cr2+ while most of the SO required hot acid with Cr2+ for reduction to H2S.},

abstract = {Rhaetian bone beds have been described from many locations in south-west England, around Bristol. One site that has never been reported is Stowey Quarry, some 13 km south of Bristol. This quarry yielded Lias, and revealed thin Rhaetian units in the quarry floor, including two bone beds, the basal Rhaetian bone bed, and a second, higher bone bed, also within the Westbury Formation. The fossil fauna of both includes elements typical of Rhaetian bone beds elsewhere, but showing differences in faunal composition between the two. The basal bone bed yielded more specimens and more species, with three taxa (Sargodon tomicus, Rhomphaiodon minor and Hybodus cloacinus) exclusive to this bed and eleven identified in total. Severnichthys acuminatus accounts for more than 50{\%} of the countable teeth from the basal bone bed, followed by Gyrolepis albertii with 20{\%}, Lissodus minimus with 14{\%} and Rhomphaiodon minor with 9{\%}. The basal bone bed, as ever, is dominated by chondrichthyans, whereas the upper bone bed is dominated by osteichthyans, which form 90{\%} of the non-dental remains. The only unique taxon is Dapedium, and Gyrolepis albertii is the most abundant species with 45{\%} of countable teeth, followed by Severnichthys acuminatus with 38{\%} and Duffinselache holwellensis with 11{\%}. These faunal differences, and the equally good condition of specimens between both samples confirms that the upper bone bed is independent of the basal bone bed, and is not a reworked subsample.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic boundary at Nhi Tao, Cao Bang Province, Vietnam was sampled in a 7.5-m-thick outcrop section at high resolution (∼ 5 cm intervals) for chemostratigraphic and magnetic susceptibility analysis. The section consists entirely of slightly argillaceous limestone representing shallow-marine facies of the Jinxi Platform, one of several large carbonate platforms within the Nanpanjiang Basin, located on the southern margin of the South China Craton. Upper Permian strata (Beds 1-7) are mainly dark-gray, cherty fossiliferous wackestones and packstones containing a diverse open-marine fauna, whereas uppermost Permian and Lower Triassic strata (Beds 9 and higher) are medium-gray calcimicrobial framestones containing rare macrofossils. These facies are separated by a 12-cm-thick oolitic-pisolitic grainstone (Bed 8) that coincides with the disappearance of most Late Permian faunal elements as well as with the first appearance of various geochemical anomalies that continue into the Lower Triassic part of the section. This "Late Permian event horizon" is characterized by (1) an abrupt decline in total organic carbon to near-zero values, (2) the onset of a sustained decline in carbonate $\delta$13C, and (3) the first of eight concentration peaks in pyrite sulfur. Significantly, each sulfide peak is associated with lower pyrite $\delta$34S values as well as with the onset of a negative carbonate $\delta$13C excursion (or the acceleration of an excursion already in progress). These chemostratigraphic relationships are consistent with multiple episodes of upwelling of sulfidic, 34S- and 13C-depleted deep-ocean waters onto the Jinxi Platform. The first upwelling event was the most intense and caused a drastic reduction in primary productivity and the demise of the Late Permian fauna; subsequent episodes were less intense but may have contributed to a delay in recovery of Early Triassic marine ecosystems. A ten-fold increase in magnetic susceptibility in Bed 9 may record the influx of fine detrital particles following destruction of terrestrial ecosystems and massive soil erosion. The terrestrial signal of the end-Permian catastrophe thus follows the marine signal with a 12-cm lag, which may reflect the time-of-transit of soil-derived particles across the Nanpanjiang Basin, suggesting that the marine and terrestrial crises in the Nhi Tao region occurred more-or-less synchronously. These observations suggest a model in which renewal of global-ocean overturn followed a prolonged interval of deep-ocean stagnation during the Late Permian, with upwelling intensity modulated by short-term (∼ 20 kyr) climate cyclicity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We estimate tropical Atlantic upper ocean temperatures using oxygen isotope and Mg/Ca ratios in well-preserved planktonic foraminifera extracted from Albian through Santonian black shales recovered during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 207 (North Atlantic Demerara Rise). On the basis of a range of plausible assumptions regarding seawater composition at the time the data support temperatures between 33° and 42°C. In our low-resolution data set spanning {\&}{\#}8764;84{\&}{\#}8211;100 Ma a local temperature maximum occurs in the late Turonian, and a possible minimum occurs in the mid to early late Cenomanian. The relation between single species foraminiferal {\&}{\#}948;18O and Mg/Ca suggests that the ratio of magnesium to calcium in the Turonian-Coniacian ocean may have been lower than in the Albian-Cenomanian ocean, perhaps coincident with an ocean 87Sr/86Sr minimum. The carbon isotopic compositions of distinct marine algal biomarkers were measured in the same sediment samples. The {\&}{\#}948;13C values of phytane, combined with foraminiferal {\&}{\#}948;13C and inferred temperatures, were used to estimate atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations through this interval. Estimates of atmospheric CO2 concentrations range between 600 and 2400 ppmv. Within the uncertainty in the various proxies, there is only a weak overall correspondence between higher (lower) tropical temperatures and more (less) atmospheric CO2. The GENESIS climate model underpredicts tropical Atlantic temperatures inferred from ODP Leg 207 foraminiferal {\&}{\#}948;18O and Mg/Ca when we specify approximate CO2 concentrations estimated from the biomarker isotopes in the same samples. Possible errors in the temperature and CO2 estimates and possible deficiencies in the model are discussed. The potential for and effects of substantially higher atmospheric methane during Cretaceous anoxic events, perhaps derived from high fluxes from the oxygen minimum zone, are considered in light of recent work that shows a quadratic relation between increased methane flux and atmospheric CH4 concentrations. With 50 ppm CH4, GENESIS sea surface temperatures approximate the minimum upper ocean temperatures inferred from proxy data when CO2 concentrations specified to the model are near those inferred using the phytane {\&}{\#}948;13C proxy. However, atmospheric CO2 concentrations of 3500 ppm or more are still required in the model in order to reproduce inferred maximum temperatures.},

abstract = {Multiple observations have revealed that environmental disturbances may have been linked to the end-Permian extinction and delayed biotic recovery. Biogeochemical constraints on the temporal and spatial changes of mass oceanic redox chemistry during the Permian-Triassic interval are essential to evaluate global significance of previous hypotheses and to improve our understanding of extinction and recovery processes. To investigate redox ocean chemistry change associated with the end-Permian extinction and subsequent delayed biotic recovery, we examine framboidal pyrites as well as sulfur isotopic compositions of pyrites from the East Greenland Basin. The size distributions of framboidal pyrites in sediments from a continuous section across the Permian-Triassic boundary reveal that sulfidic conditions in water columns were established about 0.7 m above the extinction event in the East Greenland Basin. Our detailed examination of framboidal pyrites challenges a leading hypothesis that euxinia in the photic zone caused the end-Permian ecosystem collapse. We identify several positive and negative S-isotopic shifts before and after the extinction event and demonstrate that a positive S-isotopic shift is not indicative of an abrupt change of redox chemistry in water columns, in contrast to previouos claims. The integration of isotope and framboidal pyrite data provides a nearly continuous record of ocean chemistry evolution and new insights into the end-Permian extinction and delayed biotic recovery in the East Greenland Basin.

By extrapolating rates of sedimentation based on radiocarbon data, an age of about 280,000 years is obtained for the earliest temperature minimum. Correlation with continental events suggests that the earliest temperature minimum corresponds to the first major glaciation.

abstract = {Microbial mats are dynamic and complex ecosystems exhibiting spatial and temporal heterogeneity. The physical/chemical environment is typified by steep gradients and distinct microenvironments. These microenvironments support a great diversity of species with a wide range of metabolic processes. These processes often result in coupled reactions and biogeochemical cycles, and produce important end products such as trace gases and mineral precipitates. The latter can impact the composition and character of the sediment, imparting a "biosignature." These biosignatures can be preserved in the rock record and are useful in the interpretation of fossil record on Earth and possibly as an indication of life on other planetary bodies. The modern marine stromatolites of the Exuma Cays, Bahamas, provide an ideal system for studying the populations, processes, and products in a microbial ecosystem using a multidisciplinary approach. In order to acquire redox energy, microbial populations need to carry out metabolic reactions at rates faster than the equivalent chemical (abiotic) reactions. As such, microbes can be viewed as bioreactors that preferably oxidize carbon to CO2 to maximize the energy yield. The study of the microbial role in carbonate sedimentation and lithification in these stromatolites provides a picture of microbial mats as bioreactors producing a biosignature. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Autochthonous biomarker distributions were studied in an array of different subfacies of a Devonian carbonate complex (represented in platform, reef and off-platform shelf-basinal systems). It revealed that biomarkers are sensitive indicators of depositional environments and may serve to refine palaeoenvironmental interpretations of carbonate complexes based on "classical" sedimentological/facies analyses. The contrasting biomarker composition of the carbonate platform and reef complex versus shelf-basin deposits is here interpreted as the effect of both more diverse biotic sources of a primary organic matter in the former environments (highly scattered results of sterane distribution) and contrasting styles of decay and bacterial reworking of the primary biomass. Peritidal dolostones deposited under anoxic to suboxic conditions, and with scarce sedimentological evidence of elevated salinity, reveal the highest potential of organic matter preservation among other platform/reefal facies. Their biomarker composition includes several compounds indicating hypersaline conditions and anoxia whereas others, in particular gammacerane, indicate that the water-column was stratified during sedimentation. This observation constrains environmental interpretation of these deposits, pointing to shallow-subtidal lagoons with elevated salinity and low-oxygen near-bottom waters most probably originating from a salinity-controlled stratification of the water-column. Biomarkers diagnostic of green sulphur bacteria were found in both peritidal/lagoonal dolostones and shelf-basinal facies. This indicates the existence of photic zone anoxia in the latter environment, thus suggesting a shallow position of the redoxcline. The Frasnian/Famennian mass extinction event(s) apparently had no impact on the biomarker distribution in the shelf-basinal system continuous across the stage boundary. ?? 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {The main episode of glaciation during the Late Paleozoic began just prior to the mid-Carboniferous boundary, based on evidence from Gondwanan tillites, and sequence stratigraphic and chemostratigraphic analysis in Euramerica. While gradual drawdown of atmospheric CO (sub 2) during the Devonian and Mississippian may have preconditioned the Earth for the most widespread glacial advance since the Neoproterozoic, an abrupt onset at approximately 320 Ma hints at a critical role for additional factors affecting the climate system, such as oceanic gateway closure. The relative importance of gateway closure versus CO (sub 2) drawdown in part relates to the interpretation of carbon isotope trends in Carboniferous carbonates. Carbon isotope values in European successions show a dramatic increase to a Phanerozoic maximum of approximately +6 per mil across the mid-Carboniferous boundary, which has been interpreted to reflect a period of globally enhanced organic carbon burial and CO (sub 2) drawdown associated with the widespread Pennsylvanian coal basins. However, new data from western North America do not show an equally large increase at this time and raises questions concerning the true magnitude of organic carbon burial and the origin of the European delta (super 13) C shift. Over 700 carbonate delta (super 13) C analyses from a 1.3 km marine succession at Arrow Canyon, Nevada, reveal a complex curve in which a large +7 per mil anomaly found in the lowermost Mississippian stage (Kinderhookian) stands far above the next highest peaks of +3-4 per mil in the Meramecian, Atokan and Missourian. This micrite-based curve is in good agreement with the brachiopod calcite curve of Mii et al. (1999) from the midcontinent of North America and indicates that the large, European mid-Carboniferous shift was not global. An alternative hypothesis for the large European delta (super 13) C shift is linked to the closing of the oceanic gateway between Euramerica and Gondwana associated with the assembly of Pangea, rather than high organic carbon burial. This gateway closure just prior to the mid-Carboniferous boundary increased the transport of heat and moisture to high southern latitudes of Gondwana, resulting in widespread glacial advance and eustatic drop. Gateway closure also had profound biological consequences, triggering widespread extinctions and leading to the development of a distinct Tethyan faunal realm.},

abstract = {Two geophysical onshore-offshore lines on the southern margin of Africa form the Agulhas-Karoo Geophysical Transect (AKGT) and cross prominent geological features such as the Karoo Basin, Cape Fold Belt (CFB) and the Beattie Magnetic Anomaly (BMA). Geophysical data acquired along this AKGTransect between 2004 and 2007 within the Inkaba yeAfrica (IyA) framework, provide the platform for constructing a deep crustal section (IyA-200501) for the centre 100 km of the western AKGT-transect in order to resolve these features at depth. We present a detailed deep crustal model constructed from the joint interpretation of: i. archive data comprising surface geology, aeromagnetic data, nearby deep boreholes, teleseismic receiver functions and regional seismic reflection profiles, and ii. line coincident newly acquired high-resolution geophysical data consisting of near vertical seismic reflection data, shallow P- and S-wave velocity data, wide-angle refraction data, high resolution magnetotelluric data and impedance spectroscopy measurements on borehole samples. Our model differentiates four components in the up to 45 km thick crust: 1. a ∼2 to 5 km thick folded Karoo Supergroup, disrupted by low-angle thrust faults rooted in a zone of local decollements in the lower Ecca Group and resting paraconformably on 2. a continuous undeformed sub-horizontal ∼1.5 to 10 km thick wedge of the Cape Supergroup (CSG). This CSG wedge stretches from the Escarpment in the north to the tectonic front of the CFB in the south, and rests on an unconformity that dips about three degrees to the south. The angular unconformity is interpreted as an erosional peneplain that separates the CSG wedge from component 3. the ∼13 to 21 km mid-crust basement below. The mid-crust contains a distinct north-dipping seismic fabric, here interpreted as ∼1.4 to 1.0 Ga Mesoproterozoic Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Belt (NNMB) crust. A south-dipping mid-crustal detachment, interpreted as a ductile thrust zone, separates the mid-crust from component 4. a highly reflective ∼10 to 24 km thick lower crust. The latter is interpreted as an older Palaeoproterozoic section of the NNMB (or even Archean cratonic basement), and bounded by a ∼2 to 5 km thick, highly reflective bottom layer below that lies subparallel to a clear Moho. This bottom layer is interpreted as a mafic underplate, metasomatic reaction zone, or lower-crust to mantle transition zone. Collectively the seismic reflection and wide-angle refraction data support an interpretation that the NNMB mid-crustal layer contains the BMA source, possibly connected to two zones of strong reflectivity: a ∼10 to 12 km wide northern zone and a ∼5 to 7 km wide southern zone, both about 5 km thick and 7 to 8 km below surface. We interpret the BMA source to be at least in part, a Namaqua-like massive to disseminated, deformed/metamorphosed stratiform sulphide-magnetite ore body with metasomatic overprint The seismic reflection and -refraction data support an interpretation that a Pan-African suture zone at the BMA is absent and that instead, the NNMB continues below the CFB tectonic front, probably up to the continental margin and the Agulhas Fracture Zone. The seismic reflection data also supports a thin-skinned tectonic thrust model for the evolution of the CFB without significant fore-deep stratigraphic thickening of the Karoo Basin strata. A compatible tectonic model implies a Palaeozoic collision orogen setting, coupled to a south verging subduction zone much farther south of the CFB. Similarly, the geophysical data support a south dipping subduction zone during the amalgamation of the NNMB in the Mesoproterozoic. Current reconstructions of the Rodinia supercontinent link the NNMB and the Grenville Province of North America across the Grenville-Kibaran orogen. Our seismic section tests this reconstruction through a direct comparison with seismic profiles on the opposite flank of the orogen. Although the once adjacent continental blocks are now 1000s of kilometres apart, the seismic images show a good correlation and support the reconstruction. {\textcopyright} 2011 December Geological Society of South Africa.},

abstract = {We studied the isotopic composition of dissolved sulfide in the Black Sea water column during different seasons at a total of 15 stations spanning the entire basin. The isotopic composition of dissolved sulfide averaged over all depths varies between -42.0‰ and -32.6‰, ave. -39.6±1.3‰ (1 $\sigma$ ) (118 data points). Seasonal and spatial (open sea vs. coastal stations) differences in the $\delta$ 34S-H2S values are not observed. Slight 34S enrichments in the sulfide isotope composition are revealed in the uppermost and the lowest parts of the anoxic water column. The upper trend is explained as (i) the effect of mixing with 34S-enriched sulfide produced near the interface by chemical oxidation with MnO2 or O2, (ii) small fractionation during biological sulfide oxidation, (iii) a result of a decreased isotope fractionation factor due to higher sulfate reduction rates. The lower trend is likely the result of the mixing with 34S-enriched pore water sulfide. We generated the first isotope data for sulfur intermediates in the lower part of the anoxic zone, which show values close to the isotope composition of dissolved sulfide. We hypothesize that the high isotope depletions of sulfide observed in the entire Black Sea water column are a result of low sulfate reduction rates and superimposed disproportionation reactions within the oxidative part of the sulfur cycle. Different physical and chemical mechanisms facilitating the formation and transport of sulfur intermediates in the anoxic interior are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {—The end-Guadalupian extinction, at the end of the Middle Permian, is thought to have been one of the largest biotic crises in the Phanerozoic. Previous estimates suggest that the crisis eliminated 58{\%} of marine invertebrate genera during the Capitanian stage and that its selectivity helped the Modern evolutionary fauna become more diverse than the Paleozoic fauna before the end-Permian mass extinction. However, a new sampling-standardized analysis of Permian diver- sity trends, based on 53731 marine invertebrate fossil occurrences from 9790 collections, indicates that the end-Guadalupian ‘‘extinction'' was actually a prolonged but gradual decrease in diversity from theWordian to the end of the Permian. There was no peak in extinction rates; reduced genus richness exhibited by all studied invertebrate groups and ecological guilds, and in different lati- tudinal belts, was instead driven by a sharp decrease in origination rates during the Capitanian and Wuchiapingian. The global diversity decrease was exacerbated by changes in beta diversity, most notably a reduction in provinciality due to the loss of marine habitat area and a pronounced decrease in geographic disparity over small distances. Disparity over moderate to large distances was unchanged, suggesting that small-scale beta diversity changes may have resulted from com- pression of bathymetric ranges and homogenization of onshore-offshore faunal gradients stem- ming from the spread of deep-water anoxia around the Guadalupian/Lopingian boundary. Al- though tropical invertebrate genera were no more likely than extratropical ones to become extinct, the marked reduction in origination rates during the Capitanian andWuchiapingian is consistent with the effects of global cooling (the Kamura Event), but may also be consistent with other en- vironmental stresses such as anoxia. However, a gradual reduction in diversity, rather than a sharp end-Guadalupian extinction, precludes the need to invoke drastic extinction mechanisms and in- dicates that taxonomic loss at the end of the Paleozoic was concentrated in the traditional end- Permian (end-Changhsingian) extinction, which eliminated 78{\%} of all marine invertebrate genera},

abstract = {The calcium carbonate hexahydrate mineral ikaite (CaCO3 ⋅ 6 H2O) has been documented in aquatic environments at near-freezing temperatures. An increase of the prevailing temperature in the depositional environment, results in the transformation of natural ikaite into less soluble calcium carbonate phases occasionally leaving calcite pseudomorphs in the sediments, which are considered as an indicator for primary cold water temperatures. Detailed understanding on the physicochemical parameters controlling ikaite (trans-)formation however, such as temperature and reactive solution chemical composition, are still under debate. In order to study the formation of ikaite, we conducted precipitation experiments under controlled physicochemical conditions (pH = 8.3 ± 0.1; T = 6, 12, and 18 ± 0.1 °C) at defined aqueous molar Mg/Ca ratios. The transformation of ikaite into anhydrous calcium carbonate polymorphs was investigated in solution and at air exposure. The obtained results reveal the formation of ikaite at temperatures up to 12 °C, whereas Mg-rich amorphous calcium carbonate precipitated at 18 °C. In contact with the reactive solution ikaite transformed into aragonite at aqueous molar Mg2+/Ca2+ ratios of ≥14. In contrast, ikaite separated from the Mg-rich solution and exposed to air transformed in all cases into calcite/vaterite. The herein obtained temperature limit of ≤12 for ikaite formation is significantly higher than formerly expected and most probably caused by (i) the high saturation degree of the solution with respect to ikaite and (ii) the slow dehydration of the aqueous Ca2+ ion at low temperatures. This result questions the suitability of calcite pseudomorphs (i.e. glendonites) as a proxy for near-freezing temperatures. Moreover, our findings show that the CaCO3 polymorph formed from ikaite is strongly controlled by the physicochemical conditions, such as aqueous molar Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio of the reactive fluid and H2O availability throughout the transformation process.},

abstract = {Organic matter constitutes a minor fraction of marine and freshwater sediments, yet its important contribution to the sedimentary record can be used to reconstruct marine and continental paleoenvironments. The organic matter content of sediments is the residue of past biota. The amounts and types of organic matter present in sediments consequently reflect environmental conditions that impacted ecosystems at different past times. General sources of the organic matter are inferred from bulk properties such as elemental compositions, carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios, Rock-Eval pyrolysis data, and organic petrography. Details of organic matter origins are refined by analyses of biomarker molecular compositions. Source changes are proxies for fluctuations in sea-level, oceanic surface currents, and continental climates. Algal paleoproductivity rates are indicated by organic-carbon mass accumulation rates and carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic compositions. These parameters record past availability of nutrients and, therefore, are proxies of surface mixing in the oceans and amount of land runoff to lakes. Sea-surface paleotemperatures are recorded by the number of carbon-carbon double bonds in lipid biomarkers produced by marine algae. Larger proportions of the double bonds are proxies for the cooler surface waters that accompanied periods of global glaciation and intervals of enhanced upwelling. The delta(13)C and delta D values of plant organic matter record past concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and changes in delivery of atmospheric moisture, respectively. Diagenesis, which causes the concentration and composition of organic matter in sedimentary settings to differ from those of the original biologically synthesized materials, can bias organic geochemical paleoenvironmental records. The magnitude of this potential source of misinformation must always be considered and evaluated. Comparison of multiple organic geochemical proxies of past conditions helps to compensate for the effects of diagenetic alterations and thereby to improve interpretations of paleoenvironmental change.

For the elements strontium, calcium, and carbon, rivers provide the primary input, whereas marine biogenic sedimentation dominates removal. Dissolved fluxes in rivers are related to rates of continental weathering, which in turn are strongly dependent on rates of uplift. The largest dissolved fluxes today arise in the Himalayan and Andean mountain ranges and the Tibetan Plateau. During the past 5 m.y., uplift rates in these areas have increased significantly; this suggests that weathering rates and river fluxes may have increased also. The oceanic records of carbonate sedimentation, level of the calcite compensation depth, and {\{}delta{\}}13C and {\{}delta{\}}87Sr in biogenic sediments are consistent with a global increase in river fluxes since the late Miocene. The cooling of global climate over the past few million years may be linked to a decrease in atmospheric CO2 driven by enhanced continental weathering in these tectonically active regions.},

abstract = {Animals can respond in three main ways to environments that change and deteriorate. They can cope with their inherent physiological flexibility, evolve or adapt to new conditions, or migrate away to areas consistent with survival. The main factors dictating survival are the rates of change and capacities of species to cope. Articulated brachiopods are known as a group that employ low energy solutions and exhibit slow rates in life histories characters, especially in growth and metabolic rates. This way of life carries with it a range of consequences, including poor abilities to raise metabolic rates to perform work. This brings with it poor abilities to cope with elevated temperature. Slow growth, deferred maturity and low feeding rates make them less likely to produce novel adaptations compared with other marine invertebrate taxa. Being largely restricted to hard substrata and low energy supply environments also makes it harder for them to migrate to new sites compared to other groups, because of the large geographic distances between colonisable areas. The only clear area they may have that gives them advantages is in the flexibility of their larval release strategies, where settlement can be from very short, millimetre-scale distances to hundreds of kilometres. {\^{A}}{\textcopyright} 2008 Royal Society of Edinburgh.},

abstract = {The conodont succession and stratigraphic events around the Permian–Triassic boundary (PTB) have been investigated in detail in the open sea deposits of Iran (Abadeh and Shahreza in central Iran, and Jolfa and Zal in northwestern Iran). This investigation produced a very detailed conodont zonation from the Clarkina nodosa Zone up to the Isarcicella isarcica Zone. All significant events have been accurately located and dated within this zonation, and the duration of most of these conodont zones has been calculated by cross-correlation with continental lake deposits that display obvious Milankovitch cyclicity. The unusually short duration of all conodont zones in the interval from the C. nodosa up to the Hindeodus parvus Zone indicates that there was persistent high ecological stress during this time interval. Most of the conodont zones can be accurately correlated with South China. In the interval from the C. hauschkei Zone to the H. parvus Zone, even correlation with the Arctic is possible. Within three thin stratigraphic intervals, the Changhsingian (Dorashamian) warm water conodont fauna of the C. subcarinata lineage is replaced by a cool water fauna with small H. typicalis, rare Merrillina sp., and cool water Clarkina that have very widely spaced denticles. The uppermost cool water fauna horizon comprises the lower C. zhangi Zone and can be accurately correlated with continental beds by recognition of a short reversed magnetozone below the long uppermost Permian–lowermost Triassic normal magnetozone. In Iran and Transcaucasia, this short reversed zone comprises the upper C. changxingensis–C. deflecta Zone and most of the C. zhangi Zone. Its top lies 50 cm below the top of the Paratirolites Limestone (s.s.) in the Dorasham 2 section, which is at the beginning of the upper quarter of the C. zhangi Zone. In the Germanic Basin, this short palaeomagnetic interval comprises the lower and the basal part of the upper Fulda Formation. On the Russian Platform, the Nedubrovo Formation belongs to this short reversed magnetic interval. In its upper part (corresponding to the top of the lower C. zhangi Zone, see above) there is a fallout of mafic tuffs from the Siberian Trap event that originated about 3000 km away in eruption centres in the Siberian Tungusska Basin. In the Germanic Basin and in Iran, this horizon contains volcanic microsphaerules. Thus, a direct correlation can be made between the immigration of a cool water fauna into the tropical realm and an exceptionally strong interval of explosive activity during the Siberian Trap volcanic episode. These faunal changes are the same as those found at the base of the Boundary Clay, suggesting that a short cooling event at this horizon also was due to intense volcanism. Additional influence by a bolide impact cannot be excluded. Most of the events in the interval from the C. nodosa up to the I. isarcica Zone (upper Changhsingian to middle Gangetian) in the Iranian sections can be also observed in other marine sections (e.g., in Meishan) and even in continental sections of the Germanic Basin. Of particular significance is the fact that, in the investigated Iranian sections, the PTB lies either in red sediments or in light grey sediments (as in Abadeh) that contain an ostracod fauna indicative of highly oxygenated bottom waters. Therefore, anoxia cannot be the reason for the PTB extinction event in this region, even though anoxia does cause locally or regionally elsewhere an overprint on the extinction event.},

abstract = {As recognized already by Charles Darwin, animals are geobiological agents. Darwin observed that worms aerate and mix soils on a massive scale, aiding in the decomposition of soil organic matter. A similar statement can be made about marine benthic animals. This mixing, also known as bioturbation, not only aides in the decomposition of sedimentary organic material, but as contended here, it has also significantly influenced the chemistry of seawater. In particular, it is proposed that sediment mixing by bioturbating organisms resulted in a severalfold increase in seawater sulfate concentration. For this reason, the evolution of bioturbation is linked to the significant deposition of sulfate evaporate minerals, which is largely a phenomena of the Phanerozoic, the last 542 million years and the time over which animals rose to prominence.},

abstract = {The middle part of the Miocene Monterey Formation at Naples Beach, west of Santa Barbara, California, is predominantly composed of organic-rich mudstone interstratified with phosphatic laminae. Minor lithologies include volcanic ash, dolomite, porcelanite and chert, and condensed phosphatic beds. Sediments dated as 14.3–13.5 Ma have average total organic carbon (TOC) values around 8.5 wt{\%}, and organic carbon (OC) accumulation rates are around 565 mg/cm/k.y. Sediments dated as 13.5–13 Ma are characterized by average TOC values of 12.6 wt{\%} and OC accumulation rates of around 1130 mg/cm/ k.y. The interval between 13 and 10.6 Ma is marked by condensation; average TOC values are around 8.6 wt{\%}, and OC accumulation rates diminished to around 55 mg/cm/k.y. The last interval studied is dated as 10.6–9.4 Ma, and average TOC values are around 6 wt{\%}, whereas OC accumulation rates rose again to 320 mg/cm/k.y. The presence of erosional surfaces, angular unconformities, and reworked clasts and nodules suggests that bottom-current activity and gravity-flow deposition have been instrumental in sediment accumulation. The phosphatic laminae were precipitated at a very early stage of diagenesis during periods of nonsedimentation. They formed less permeable sedimentary lids and may as such have contributed to enhanced OC preservation. Between 13 and 10.6 Ma, the thus-formed phosphatic laminae were frequently subjected to subsequent sediment winnowing and reworking, resulting in the formation of condensed phosphatic beds. Calculated P:C molar ratios suggest that (1) the measured section is highly enriched in phosphorus (P) relative to OC; (2) regeneration of organic P from organic-matter decomposition was negligible; and (3) the source of P was external, likely upwelled bottom water rich in inorganic P. In spite of good preservation conditions and correspondingly high TOC contents, the overall OC accumulation rates are moderate in comparison to those of actual high productivity areas, which is mainly due to the episodic character of depositional processes and the intervening long periods of nondeposition and sediment reworking. They preclude this section, and by extrapolation, the Monterey Formation in general from being an important OC sink during the middle Miocene. Alternatively, large OC sinks were probably created on the continent (lignite deposits) and in sedimentary depocenters, which received increasing amounts of detrital sediments due to a combination of climate change, spreading of grasslands, and the increasing importance of mountain chains such as the Himalaya. The associated high nutrient fluxes may have been involved in the backstepping and drowning of carbonate platforms and in the generation of widespread phosphat-rich deposits during the late early and early middle Miocene.},

The fossil record provides rich information on past extinctions that can help predict biotic responses. We show that over 23 million years, taxonomic membership and geographic range size consistently explain a large proportion of extinction risk variation in six major taxonomic groups. We assess intrinsic risk-extinction risk predicted by paleontologically calibrated models-for modern genera in these groups. Mapping the geographic distribution of these genera identifies coastal biogeographic provinces where fauna with high intrinsic risk are strongly affected by human activity or climate change. Such regions are disproportionately in the tropics, raising the possibility that these ecosystems may be particularly vulnerable to future extinctions. Intrinsic risk provides a prehuman baseline for considering current threats to marine biodiversity.},

abstract = {Throughout Earth history, almost all preserved organic matter has been incorporated in marine sediments deposited under oxygenated waters along continental margins. Given modern oceanic productivity and sediment burial rates of 50 × 1015 and 0.16 × 1015 gC yr-1, respectively, organic preservation in the marine environment is {\textless} 0.5{\%} efficient. Although correlative information is often used to suggest that productivity, sediment accumulation rate, bottom water oxicity, and organic matter source are key variables, the mechanisms governing sedimentary organic matter preservation have remained unclear. The factors which directly determine preservation vary with depositional regime, but have in common a critical interaction between organic and inorganic materials over locally variable time scales. More than 90{\%} of total sedimentary organic matter from a wide variety of marine depositional environments cannot be physically separated from its mineral matrix. This strongly associated organic component varies directly in concentration with sediment surface area and thus appears to be sorbed to mineral grains. Sediments accumulating outside deltas along continental shelves and upper slopes characteristically exhibit mineral surface area loadings approximately equivalent to a single molecular covering. These monolayer-equivalent coatings include a fraction of reversibly bound organic molecules that are intrinsically labile, but resist appreciable mineralization as they pass rapidly through oxygenated surface sediments and are preserved within underlying anoxic deposits. The delivery of mineral surface area is the primary control on organic matter preservation within these expansive coastal margin regions where roughly 45{\%} of all organic carbon accumulates. Deltaic sediments account for roughly another 45{\%} of global carbon burial, but often exhibit much less than monolayer-equivalent organic coatings. This pattern is seen in periodically oxygenated sediments off the mouth of the Amazon River, even though the component clastic minerals are discharged by the river with monolayer coatings. Comparably extensive losses of organic matter, including distinct particles such as pollen grains, occur in the surfaces of deep-sea turbidites in which long term reaction with O2 is clearly the causative factor. Sub-monolayer organic coatings also are observed in continental rise and abyssal plain sediments where slower accumulation rates and deeper O2 penetration depths result in increased oxygen exposure times and little ({\~{}} 5{\%} of the global total) organic matter preservation. A transition zone between monolayer and sub-monolayer organic coatings apparently occurs on lower continental slopes, and is marked along the Washington coast by parallel offshore decreases in total organic matter and pollen between 2000-3000 m water depth. Sediments underlying highly productive, low-oxygen coastal waters such as off Peru and western Mexico are characteristically rich in organic matter, but account for only {\~{}} 5{\%} of total organic carbon burial. These sediments show a direct relationship between organic matter content and mineral surface area, but at organic loadings 2-5 times a monolayer equivalent. Organic materials sorbed in excess of a monolayer thus also may be partially protected. Such high sedimentary organic contents may result from equilibration with DOM-rich porewaters, or very brief O2 exposure times which allow preservation of extremely oxygen-sensitive organic materials such as pigments and unsaturated lipids. Thus organic matter preservation throughout much of the ocean may be controlled largely by competition between sorption at different protective thresholds and oxic degradation. Future research strategies should be specifically directed at delineating the mechanisms for organic matter preservation in marine sediments. In particular, special effort is needed to determine the amounts and types of sorbed organic materials and the nature of their bonding to mineral surfaces. The extent and dynamics with which organic molecules are partitioned between porewaters and solid phases also should be determined, as well as the effects of these phase associations on their reactivities toward chemical and biological agents. In addition, processes for slow oxic (and suboxic) degradation of organic materials bear investigation in deep-sea sediments, as well as in other extreme environments such as oxidizing turbidites, weathering shales, and soils. Such studies should include characterizations of hydrolysis-resistant organic materials and emphasize the complementary use of biochemical compositions with readily separable particles such as pollen to calibrate and typify the mechanisms and stages of sedimentary organic degradation. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Gas seeps in the euxinic northwestern Black Sea provide an excellent opportunity to study anaerobic, methane-based ecosystems with minimum interference from oxygen-dependent processes. An integrated approach using fluorescence- and electron microscopy, fluorescence in situ hybridization, lipid biomarkers, stable isotopes ($\delta$13C), and petrography revealed insight into the anatomy of concretionary methane-derived carbonates currently forming within the sediment around seeps. Some of the carbonate concretions have been found to be surrounded by microbial mats. The mats harbour colonies of sulphate-reducing bacteria (DSS-group), and archaea (ANME-1), putative players in the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Isotopically-depleted lipid biomarkers indicate an uptake of methane carbon into the biomass of the mat biota. Microbial metabolism sustains the precipitation of concretionary carbonates, significantly depleted in 13C. The concretions consist of rectangularly orientated, rod- to dumbbell-shaped crystal aggregates made of fibrous high Mg-calcite. The sulphate-reducing bacteria exhibit intracellular storage inclusions, and magnetosomes with greigite (Fe3S 4), indicating that iron cycling is involved in the metabolism of the microbial population. Transfer of Fe3+ into the cells is apparently mediated by abundant extracellular vesicles resembling known bacterial siderophore vesicles (marinobactine) in size (20 to 100 nm) and structure. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The high spatial resolution analysis of the mineral and organic composition of otoliths using Raman micro-spectrometry involves rigorous protocols for sample preparation previously established for microchemistry and trace elements analyses. These protocols often include otolith embedding in chemically neutral resin (i.e., resins which do not contain, in detectable concentration, elements usually sought in the otoliths). Such embedding may however induce organic contamination. In this paper, Raman micro-spectrometry reveals the presence of organic contamination onto the surface obtained from the use of epoxy resin, specifically Araldite. This contamination level varies depending on otolith structures. Core and checks, known as structural discontinuities, exhibit the most important level of contaminations. Our results suggest that otolith embedding with resin affects the organic matrix of the otolith, probably through an infiltration of the resin in the crystalline structure. The interpretation of chemical otolith signatures, especially Raman otolith signatures, and stable isotope analyses should then be revised in light of these results. In this respect, we propose a method for the correction of Raman otolith signatures for contamination effects.},

abstract = {We used sequential extractions to quantify different forms of particulate phosphorus (PP) in sediments along the salinity gradient of the Patuxent River estuary. About 50–90{\%} of the PP was phosphate bound to iron oxides (Fe-P), and 8–30{\%} was organic P (org-P). Loosely sorbed phosphate (sorb-P), detrital apatite, and authigenic plus biogenic apatite each made up ,10{\%} of the PP. Suspended sediments from the watershed and deposited sediments in tidal freshwater had the highest concentrations of Fe-P, ranging about 30–55 mmol g21 sediment. As pore-water salinity increased to 7 along the estuarine gradient, Fe-P declined to 15–25 mmol g21, org-P increased from 4 to 10 mmol g21, sorb-P increased from 0.5 to 2.5 mmol g21, and total sediment PP declined from 60 to 40 mmol g21. Concentrations of pore-water solutes also changed with salinity. As salinity increased, dissolved Fe and ammonium decreased, while dissolved phosphate increased. Near the freshwater end of the gradient, the molar ratio of pore-water ammonium : phosphate was generally .16 (the Redfield ratio) and ranged up to .700, while at the saline end of the gradient the ratio was generally ,16 and ranged down to ,1.5. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that phosphate is released from terrigenous sediments when they are deposited in saline portions of the estuary where sulfide may enhance dissolution of Fe-P and form Fe sulfide precipitates. Such phosphate release may contribute to the generally observed switch from phosphorus limitation in freshwater to nitrogen limitation in coastal marine water.},

abstract = {A reduction of the carbonate-carbon to organic-carbon export rain ratio during glacial times has been advanced to explain the glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 variations. This hypothesis is tested and implications for the dynamics of sedimentary carbonate preservation and dissolution are explored with a multi-box model (mbm) of the ocean carbon cycle, fully coupled to a new transient early diagenesis model (called medusa). A peak reduction of the rain ratio by 40{\%} at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) was found to produce a net atmospheric p CO2 reduction of about 40 ppm. Changing shelf carbonate accumulation rates and continental weathering inputs produced a 55-60 ppm reduction. The combination of the two mechanisms generates a p CO2 change of 90-95 ppm, which compares well with the observed data. However, the resulting model sedimentary record does not conform to actual sedimentary records. The changes related to continental shelf processes and variable weathering flux depress the calcite saturation horizon (CSH) by about 1 km at the LGM; if rain ratio variations are also considered, that depression increases by another km. In addition to this large amplitude for the CSH, possibly due to the adopted box-model approach, the changing rain ratio also leads to transition zone changes in the model sedimentary record that are opposite in phase with data-based reconstructions. Realistic changes in the aragonite fraction of the carbonate rain were found to have only a minimal impact on atmospheric p CO2. Finally, chemical erosion of deep-sea sediment was shown to reduce the amplitude of variation of the sedimentary CCD by about 10-20{\%}.

abstract = {From molecular and isotopic data obtained with a new separation technique, and from published data, it is possible to discuss the relative importance of genetic and post-genetic molecular and isotopic fractionations affecting natural gases. Using a $\delta$13Ci$\delta$13Cjversus ln( CiCj) plot, we suggest from the ethane-propane system that it is possible to distinguish hydrocarbon gases generated by the primary cracking of kerogen, from gases generated by the secondary cracking of oil. With the methane-ethane system, we discuss mixing of thermogenic and biogenic gases, degree of maturity of thermogenic gases, and residues of diffusive leakage. We consider that although the prime order of fractionation in gases is due to genetic phenomena, second-order effects due to post-genetic fractionation (diffusion, oxidation etc.) may be recognized, and in some cases must be taken into account to model the geochemical data on a gas field. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

abstract = {Organic P and organic C concentrations were measured in several well-characterized Phanerozoic marine shale sequences with the primary focus being the Camp Run Member of the Devonian-Mississippian New Albany Shale. Sequences were selected with close spatial association of bioturbated and laminated sediments which reflect deposition from oxic and anoxic waters, respectively. Average organic C/P mole ratios calculated from the data are 150 for bioturbated shales and 3900 for the laminated shales of the New Albany. Differences in the extent and mechanisms of early-diagenesis related to the oxygenation of waters at the sediment-water interface can account for the C/P ratios of buried organic matter. Low C/P ratios of bioturbated sediments are attributed to (1) the increased ability of bacteria to store P in well-oxygenated environments which leads to the production of low C/P ratio bacterial biomass and (2) the extensive oxidation of sedimentary organic matter resulting in the formation of residual organic phases with low C/P ratios. High organic C/P ratios of laminated sediments are explained by a combination of (1) the limited ability of bacteria to store P under anoxic conditions, (2) extensive P regeneration from sedimentary organic matter, (3) enhanced C preservation relative to the bioturbated shales. It is also shown that relative to organic C, laminated shales are not as effective a P sink as are bioturbated shales. This provides a mechanism in anoxic environments for burying large quantities of organic matter without simultaneously sequestering the P needed to sustain further productivity.},

abstract = {The basement rocks of southern Sweden were deeply weathered in Late Triassic through Cretaceous times, and possibly even earlier. Sub-Mesozoic saprolites formed, presumably due to long-term warmth and humidity, in conjunction with decomposition of abundant organic matter and subsequent infiltration of acidic water. The upper parts of the weathering profiles were subjected to intense leaching and kaolinitisation whereas the less evolved deep weathering front is enriched in smectite. Thus, any erosion prior to full regolith development, or extraordinary deep erosion, released less developed, smectite-rich weathering material to the Late Triassic-Jurassic receiving basins. Mesozoic sedimentary successions in Southern Sweden show high detrital smectite and/or kaolinite contents, moderate illite contents and low chlorite contents, compatible with expected mid-latitude warm equable greenhouse conditions. Norian and older Triassic haematite-cemented continental arkoses and smectite-dominated clays (smectite≫kaolinite) were clearly formed in arid settings. From the Rhaetian and throughout the Jurassic, humid onshore conditions sustained abundant plant and peat accumulation, early diagenetic meteoric flushing, and intense chemical weathering. Kaolinite is therefore a dominating detrital clay mineral in these sedimentary successions (kaolinite≈illite≫chlorite and smectite (I/S)). Minor quantitative variations in clay mineralogy within the "humid climate" Rhaetian-Jurassic sedimentary successions are difficult to interpret. In deltaic coal-bearing successions, the detrital clay mineral composition is conspicuously constant (kaolinite≈illite≫chlorite), possibly due to post-depositional clay mineral transformation. Conversely, in shallow marine deposits, some quantitative variation is notable (kaolinite≈illite{\textgreater}variable smectite≫chlorite). This may reflect that the original detrital composition was better preserved in shallow marine settings. Smectitic clay minerals associated with gypsum and caliche nodules ambiguously indicate increased aridity towards the end of the Jurassic. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Myr ago, which marked the end of continental conditions in the European Triassic, and the arrival of marine deposition, may have been heralded by the arrival of burrowing shrimps. Here we document an unusual taphonomic situation, in which classic basal Rhaetic bone bed is preserved inside a Thalassinoides burrow system at the base of the Westbury Mudstone Formation, in the highest part of the Blue Anchor Formation, at Charton Bay, Devon, UK. The fauna comprises four species of sharks and five species of bony fishes. The sharks, Rhomphaiodon ('. Hybodus'), Duffinselache, Lissodus, and Pseudocetorhinus are small, and include predatory and crushing/opportunistic feeders. The top predator was the large Severnichthys, typical of Rhaetian ichthyofaunas, and Gyrolepis was a smaller predator. Late Triassic bony fishes generally included many shell-crushers, and the Charton Bay assemblage is no exception, with teeth of Sargodon, '. Lepidotes', and Dapedium, the last being a rare record for the British Rhaetic. This kind of burrowed and filled contact occurs elsewhere at the base of the Westbury Mudstone Formation, and so may be a typical marker of the early phases of the Rhaetic Transgression.},

Barite formation appears to be caused by biological activity in the upper water column, but the exact mechanism is unknown. Analysis of 1-53 $\mu$im and {\textgreater}53 $\mu$m sized particles obtained by large volume in situ filtration in the Atlantic suggests that barites are formed in the {\textgreater}53$\mu$m fraction in near-surface waters and released into the 1-53 $\mu$m fraction at depths below the euphotic zone. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis of both size fractions shows first, that barites are formed almost exclusively in microenvironments containing decaying organic matter and the remains of siliceous plankton, and second that barites do not appear to be actively formed by the planktonic organism sampled. This explains the origin of suspended barite, and the similarity of dissolved Si and Ba distributions in the ocean. Suspended and sedimented barite may indicate the intensity of organic matter regeneration in the water column.},

This isotopic pattern has been observed for woody stems, roots, seeds and fruits, emerging leaves, and parasitic plants incapable of net CO2 fixation. Unlike in C3 plants, roots of herbaceous C4 plants are generally not 13C-enriched compared with leaves.Wereview six hypotheses aimed at explaining this isotopic pattern in C3 plants: (1) variation in biochemical composition of heterotrophic tissues compared with leaves; (2) seasonal separation of growth of leaves and heterotrophic tissues, with corresponding variation in photosynthetic discrimination against 13C; (3) differential use ofday v. night sucrose between leaves and sink tissues, with day sucrose being relatively 13C-depleted and night sucrose 13C-enriched; (4) isotopic fractionation during dark respiration; (5) carbon fixation by PEP carboxylase; and (6) developmental variation in photosynthetic discrimination against 13C during leaf expansion. Although hypotheses (1) and (2) may contribute to the general pattern, they cannot explain all observations. Some evidence exists in support of hypotheses (3) through to (6), although for hypothesis (6) it is largely circumstantial. Hypothesis (3) provides a promising avenue for future research. Direct tests of these hypotheses should be carried out to provide insight into the mechanisms causing within-plant variation in carbon isotope composition.},

abstract = {A detailed study of size distributions of framboidal pyrite in Holocene Black Sea sediments establishes the timing of a change from deposition under an oxic water column to deposition under an anoxic and sulfidic water column. In the most recent carbonate-rich sediments (Unit I) and in the organic carbon-rich sapropel (Unit II), framboid size distributions are remarkably uniform (mean diameter = 5 $\mu$m); over 95{\%} of the framboids in Unit I and Unit II are {\textless} 7 $\mu$m in diameter. These properties of framboidal pyrite are consistent with framboid nucleation and growth within an anoxic and sulfidic water column, followed by transport to the sediment-water interface, cessation of pyrite growth due to the exhaustion of reactive iron, and subsequent burial. In contrast, the organic carbon-poor sediments of lacustrine Unit III contain pyrite framboids that are generally much larger in size (mean diameter = 10 $\mu$m). In Unit III, over 95{\%} of the framboids are {\textless} 25 $\mu$m in diameter, 40{\%} of framboids are between 7 $\mu$m and 25 $\mu$m, and framboids up to 50 $\mu$m in diameter are present. This distribution of sizes suggests framboid nucleation and growth within anoxic sediment porewaters. These new data on size distributions of framboidal pyrite confirm that the development of water-column anoxia in the Black Sea coincided with the initiation of deposition of laminated Unit II sapropels.},

abstract = {Instead of having been more or less constant, as once assumed, it is now apparent that the major ion chemistry of the oceans has varied substantially over time. For instance, independent lines of evidence suggest that calcium concentration ([Ca2+]) has approximately halved and magnesium concentration ([Mg2+]) approximately doubled over the last 100 million years. On the other hand, the calcite compensation depth, and hence the CaCO3saturation, has varied little over the last 100 My as documented in deep sea sediments. We combine these pieces of evidence to develop a proxy for seawater carbonate ion concentration ([CO32-]) over this period of time. From the calcite saturation state (which is proportional to the product of [Ca2+] times [CO32-], but also affected by [Mg2+]), we can calculate seawater [CO32-]. Our results show that [CO32-] has nearly quadrupled since the Cretaceous. Furthermore, by combining our [CO32-] proxy with other carbonate system proxies, we provide calculations of the entire seawater carbonate system and atmospheric CO2. Based on this, reconstructed atmospheric CO2is relatively low in the Miocene but high in the Eocene. Finally, we make a strong case that seawater pH has increased over the last 100 My.

abstract = {Significantly different Guadalupian-Late Triassic patterns are observed in the evolution of attached and isolated carbonate platforms of the southwestern Tethys (Oman Mountains). Close to the rim of the attached Arabian platform, carbonates of the Saiq and Mahil Formations reveal an almost complete Permian-Triassic sedimentary record. Guadalupian-Changhsingian 3rd order sequences consist of fossiliferous transgressive systems tracts and monotonous highstand systems tracts with mud/wackestone and coral bafflestone. The youngest Changhsingian beds are bioturbated floatstone with crinoids, sponges and bryozoans. All sediments indicate a healthy, tropical carbonate production. Above, a unique facies change begins with a pyrite-encrusted omission surface. Greenish mudstone rich in authigenic pyrite infills the relief of the unconformity and is overlain by clastic sediment and by laminated, microbialite-bearing carbonate. Unfossiliferous sediments and seafloor cements indicate a change in carbonate production towards abiotic processes. Prevailing anoxic conditions were interrupted by seven oxic event beds, as indicated either by low-diversity and small-sized ichnotaxa or by shell beds with low-diversity bivalve and crinoid assemblages. By comparison with published data, the described sedimentary sequence can be assigned to the Changhsingian-earliest Griesbachian. Beginning probably with the Anisian, bioturbated Griesbachian-Dienerian recovery period and the unconformity below to the latest grain-supported sediment textures mark the return to biogenic tropical carbonate production under oxic conditions. The Middle-Late Triassic carbonate platform consists of stacked high-frequency shallowing upward cycles. By contrast, carbonate production of Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms was discontinuous and interrupted by a large gap. Guadalupian deposits of the Al Jil Formation consist of bioclastic limestone typical of a tropical carbonate production. The uppermost bed, an impoverished bioclastic packstone capped by an unconformity, marks the onset of platform drowning which resulted from the end-Guadalupian mass extinction. Above, a polymict breccia witnessed rift pulses of the Neo-Tethys. The overlying pelagic mud- and packstone contains radiolarians and rare foraminifera of Lopingian age, and overlying microbialites. In the Carnian, tropical shallow-water carbonate production restarted with a low-relief platform and culminated in a Norian-Rhaetian reef-rimmed platform. Stacked Lofer cycles dominated the inner platform of Jebel Kawr (Misfah Formation). We here propose a differential onset and severity of the Late Permian mass extinctions for carbonate platforms. On the Arabian Plate, tropical carbonate production collapsed after the end-Lopingian mass extinction and was replaced by microbialites and sea-floor cements during the earliest Triassic. After approximately six million years, tropical shallow-water carbonate production resumed in the Middle Triassic. Neo-Tethyan isolated platforms drowned shortly after the end-Guadalupian mass extinction and did not recover before the Late Triassic. Absence of shallow-water limestone suggests that carbonate production of isolated platforms ceased for about 30 million years, a period exceeding the recovery of most marine ecosystems.

The Late Jurassic of New Zealand is characterized by a slight warming in the Oxfordian-Kimmeridgian and a subsequent cooling trend in the Tithonian.

The molecular distribution of several biomarker compounds, organism-specific biomarkers and bulk sediment characteristics such as {\%}OM, C/N and $\delta$13C were used to assess differences in OM source and transport between a strongly tidally-influenced estuary (Harney River) and one that is only seasonally influenced by estuarine waters (Taylor River). The data show mixing of combined terrestrial and autochthonous freshwater-derived OM, with marine planktonic and seagrass-derived OM in the middle to lower estuary of the Harney River. In contrast, such mixing did not occur to a measurable degree at the Taylor River, where low water discharge and exchange does not allow for any significant mixing of OM from end-member sources. Differences in hydrological conditions and benthic plant biomass and productivity between the two systems results in different OM inputs, which are reflected in the quality and degree of diagenesis of the sedimentary OM. Specific applications and potential limitations of traditional biomarker compounds for OM source assessment are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Dramatic global climate change in the Early Cretaceous suggests that numerous boreal cool events perturbed otherwise warm conditions. Abundant glendonites in Valanginian and Aptian strata are thought to be key markers of cold conditions; however, their use as climate indicators has been questioned. Therefore, a detailed study of glendonites in the context of host-rock geochemistry was conducted on Cretaceous strata exposed on Ellef Ringnes Island, Sverdrup Basin, Canadian High Arctic, to elucidate paleoenvironment controls on periodic glendonite occurrence throughout the Early Cretaceous. Two prominent glendonite zones were identified in Valanginian and Aptian strata. Data for carbon stable isotopes show $\delta$13Ccarb values of -29.5‰ to -10.5‰, consistent with a carbon source from organic matter within the surrounding shale. Trace metal data suggest deposition occurred under an overall oxidizing water column in a setting with higher than average phosphorus and highly degraded organic matter. There is no variation in the geochemical parameters of the mudstones with or without glendonites. Glendonite-bearing zones are coincident, however, with regional evidence for brief periods of colder climate conditions within the otherwise warm Early Cretaceous. We conclude that while the overall conditions for glendonite formation were prevalent throughout the Cretaceous, it was the brief cold periods that provided the final range of stability for their preservation in discrete zones of Valanginian and Aptian strata. These results support the model of an overall warm Early Cretaceous climate being punctuate by several "cold snaps" of as-yet uncertain origin. {\textcopyright} 2017 Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {Fossil bioapatite may yield biogeochemical signals of paleoenvironments captured by living organisms. Bioapatite may be diagenetically altered, however, with ions added or removed post-mortem; such change is typically assessed using destructive and demanding techniques. Here, Raman spectroscopy is used as a rapid and non-destructive way to identify significant diagenetic alteration of fossil bioapatite. We found spectral parameters of phosphate symmetric stretching ($\nu$1-PO4 3−) to be very sensitive to variations in apatite chemistry, particularly with respect to common diagenetic components (CO3 2−,F−,Sr2+). The Raman spectral parameters were subsequently applied to a set of modern (biogenic) and geologic (magmatic) apatite samples as potential endmembers for diagenetic alteration. Raman spectra were also collected from enamel and dentin (respectively resistant vs. alteration-prone) of fossil teeth. Phosphate-oxygen isotopic values from the same enamel–dentin samples were used as an index of alteration and provided definition of Raman spectral parameters as relates to diagenetic alteration. Diagenetically altered samples were characterised by spectra with $\nu$1-PO4 3− widths (at half maximum height) less than 13.0 cm−1, and $\nu$1-PO4 3− band positions greater than 964.7 cm−1. Raman spectroscopy is shown to have potential as a tool for pre-screening fossil apatite samples before further analyses. {\textcopyright}},

abstract = {The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition is marked by distinct perturbations in the global carbon cycle resulting in a prominent negative carbon-isotope excursion at the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary, well known from a plethora of marine and continental sediments. Potential causes for this negative delta(13)C trend (and their links to the latest Permian mass extinction) have been intensively debated in the literature. In order to draw conclusions regarding causation, a general delta(13)C curve was defined after consideration of all available datasets and with due reference to the biostratigraphic background. The most important features of the P-T carbon-isotope trend are the following: the 4-7 parts per thousand delta(13)C decline (lasting similar to 500,000 years) is gradual and began in the Changhsingian at the stratigraphic level of the C. bachmanni Zone. The decreasing trend is interrupted by a short-term positive event that starts at about the latest Permian low-latitude marine main extinction event horizon (=EH), indicating that the extinction itself cannot have caused the negative carbon-isotope excursion. After this short-term positive excursion, the delta(13)C decline continues to a first minimum at about the P-T boundary. A subsequent slight increase is followed by a second (occasionally two-peaked) minimum in the lower (and middle) I. isarcica Zone. The negative carbon-isotope excursion was most likely a consequence of a combination of different causes that may include: (1) direct and indirect effects of the Siberian Trap and contemporaneous volcanism and (2) anoxic deep waters occasionally reaching very shallow sea levels. A sudden release of isotopically light methane from oceanic sediment piles or permafrost soils as a source for the negative carbon-isotope trend is questionable at least for the time span a little below the EH and somewhat above the P-T boundary.

Here we present a new extended organic carbon isotope record from a cored T-J boundary succession in the Danish Basin, dated by high-resolution palynostratigraphy and supplemented by a marine faunal record. Correlated with reference C-isotope and biotic records from the UK, it provides new evidence that the major biotic changes, both on land and in the oceans, commenced prior to the most prominent negative C-isotope excursion. If massive methane release was involved, it did not trigger the end-Triassic mass extinction. Instead, this negative C-isotope excursion is contemporaneous with the onset of floral recovery on land, whereas marine ecosystems remained perturbed. The decoupling between ecosystem recovery on land and in the sea is more likely explained by long-term flood basalt volcanism releasing both SO2 and CO2 with short- and long-term effects, respectively.},

abstract = {Evidence from stratigraphic sections of the Panthalassa, Paleo-Tethys and Neo-Tethys suggests that the oceans experienced widespread anoxia during the Late Permian, which likely contributed to the extinction of 90{\%} of marine and 70{\%} of terrestrial species. The Late Permian and Early Triassic were also characterized by significant carbon isotope excursions implying that considerable perturbations in the carbon cycle occurred. Bathymetric features of the Panthalassa during this period are not well known since most of the ocean floor has been subducted; however, tectonic reconstructions suggest that active marine subduction zones surrounded Pangea. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there was an active mid-ocean ridge system located in Panthalassa during the Late Permian. In this study, the impact of such a spreading center within Panthalassa on the climate and carbon cycle is investigated using a comprehensive climate system model for the end-Permian. This is a novel approach because a majority of previous simulations assumed a flat bottom for the Panthalassa deep-sea. The mid-ocean ridge (MOR) simulation enhanced vertical mixing and topographic steering of the currents near the ridge-axis but in comparison with the simulation using a flat bottom, changes in the global distribution of water masses and circulation in the Panthalassa were insignificant. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were not considerably affected by the implementation of the mid-ocean ridge. Thus the approximation of using a flat-bottom topography in ocean models for the Late Permian remains valid. In a second sensitivity study, the effect of a sill between the deep Paleo-Tethys and Panthalassa on water mass distribution and oxygen content has been investigated. Model results suggest that the introduction of a sill led to enhanced stratification, as well as an increase in salinity and temperature in the Paleo-Tethys. An associated reduction of the dissolved oxygen concentration to dysoxic to near-anoxic conditions below 1800 m suggests that the changes in sill height between the Paleo-Tethys and Panthalassa may have been a contributing factor of regional importance to the Permian-Triassic mass extinction.},

abstract = {The geological record provides evidence for the periodic occurrence of water column anoxia and formation of organic-rich deposits in the North Atlantic Ocean during the mid-Cretaceous (hereafter called the proto-North Atlantic). Both changes in primary productivity and oceanic circulation likely played a role in the development of the low-oxygen conditions. Several studies suggest that an increased input of phosphorus from land initiated oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). Other proposed mechanisms invoke a vigorous upwelling system and an ocean circulation pattern that acted as a trap for nutrients from the Pacific Ocean. Here, we use a detailed biogeochemical box model for the proto-North Atlantic to analyse under what conditions anoxia could have developed during OAE2 (94 Ma). The model explicitly describes the coupled water, carbon, oxygen and phosphorus cycles for the deep basin and continental shelves. In our simulations, we assume the vigorous water circulation from a recent regional ocean model study. Our model results for pre-OAE2 and OAE2 conditions are compared to sediment records of organic carbon and proxies for photic zone euxinia and bottom water redox conditions (e.g. isorenieratane, carbon/phosphorus ratios). Our results show that a strongly elevated input of phosphorus from rivers and the Pacific Ocean relative to pre-OAE2 conditions is a requirement for the widespread development of low oxygen in the proto-North Atlantic during OAE2. Moreover, anoxia in the proto-North Atlantic is shown to be greatly influenced by the oxygen concentration of Pacific bottom waters. In our model, primary productivity increased significantly upon the transition from pre-OAE2 to OAE2 conditions. Our model captures the regional trends in anoxia as deduced from observations, with euxinia spreading to the northern and eastern shelves but with the most intense euxinia occurring along the southern coast. However, anoxia in the central deep basin is difficult to achieve in the model. This suggests that the ocean circulation used in the model may be too vigorous and/or that anoxia in the proto-North Atlantic was less widespread than previously thought. {\textcopyright} 2014 Author(s).},

abstract = {The uppermost Permian strata of the Abadeh section in Iran consist of 56 m of skeletal limestone (Abadehian), that grades upward into 18 m of grey, bioturbated lime mudstone (Djulfian), which in turn grades upward to 18 m of red, nodular wackestone (Dorashamian) containing an abundant pelagic fauna. The overlying lowermost Triassic includes two enigmatic layers at its base. Immediately above the boundary is a 1-m-thick layer of inorganically precipitated synsedimentary carbonate cement. The cement is composed of 10-20-cm-long crystals oriented either perpendicular to the bedding or as dome-shaped features resembling botryoids. About 0.5 m of wackestone overlies the cement layer. The second layer is a 1.5-m-thick grainstone overlying the cement horizon and consists of recrystallised spherical grains (ooids or peloids). The remainder of unit 'A' is composed of 100+ m of grey, bioturbated to nodular lime mudstone. The lithofacies succession of the uppermost Permian is interpreted to represent deposition under increasing water depth, related to rising of relative sea level, which led to drowning of the carbonate platform to below storm wave base. Sedimentologic characteristics, lithology, wide distribution, and slow sedimentation rates indicate that strata immediately below the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary (Dorashamian interval) were deposited in deep, oxygenated waters. The enigmatic lowermost Triassic synsedimentary carbonate cement and grainstone layers are interpreted to have been deposited in shallow waters, indicating a rapid and major drop in relative sea level at the end of Permian time in this area, followed by a relative sea-level rise during the earliest Triassic. Precipitation of synsedimentary cement immediately above the P-T boundary in Iran and elsewhere (South China) suggests a global change in ocean chemistry. One possible explanation is that dissolved calcium and bicarbonate concentrations in seawater increased sufficiently to promote spontaneous carbonate precipitation, a rare event in the Phanerozoic but common during Precambrian time. Alternatively, a massive heating event could have resulted in CO2 degassing and decreases in oceanic carbonate solubility, both leading to inorganic, synsedimentary carbonate precipitation. Inorganic precipitation of synsedimentary carbonate cement may indicate that biochemical production of carbonate was halted due to the P-T boundary events. Our study indicates that shallow and moderately deep waters during the latest Permian were well oxygenated in the open ocean setting of the central Tethys Sea in Iran. Therefore, P-T mass extinction scenarios that invoke upon widespread marine anoxia should be viewed with caution. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Proposed links between magmatism and ecological catastrophe include global warming, global cooling, ozone depletion and changes in ocean chemistry. However, the critical combinations of environmental changes responsible for global mass extinction are undetermined. In particular, the combined and competing climate effects of sulfur and carbon outgassing remain to be quantified. Here we present results from global climate model simulations of flood basalt outgassing that account for sulfur chemistry and aerosol microphysics with coupled atmosphere and ocean circulation. We consider the effects of sulfur and carbon in isolation and in tandem. We find that coupling with the ocean strongly influences the climate response to prolonged flood basalt-scale outgassing. We suggest that sulfur and carbon emissions from the Siberian Traps combined to generate systemic swings in temperature, ocean circulation and hydrology within a longer-term trend towards a greenhouse world in the early Triassic.},

abstract = {Reefs containing abundant calcified metazoans occur at several stratigraphic levels within carbonate platforms of the terminal Proterozoic Nama Group, central and southern Namibia. The reef-bearing strata span an interval ranging from approximately 550 Ma to 543 Ma. The reefs are composed of thrombolites (clotted internal texture) and stromatolites (laminated internal texture) that form laterally continuous biostromes, isolated patch reefs, and isolated pinnacle reefs ranging in scale from a meter to several kilometers in width. Stromatolite-dominated reefs occur in depositionally updip positions within carbonate ramps, whereas thrombolite-dominated reefs occur broadly across the ramp profile and are well developed as pinnacle reefs in downdip positions.  The three-dimensional morphology of reef-associated fossils was reconstructed by computer, based on digitized images of sections taken at 25-micron intervals through 15 fossil specimens and additionally supported by observations of over 90 sets of serial sections. Most variation observed in outcrop can be accounted for by a single species of cm-scale, lightly calcified goblet-shaped fossils herein described as Namacalathus hermanastes gen. et sp. nov. These fossils are characterized by a hollow stem open at both ends attached to a broadly spheroidal cup marked by a circular opening with a downturned lip and six (or seven) side holes interpreted as diagenetic features of underlying biological structure. The goblets lived atop the rough topography created by ecologically complex microbial-algal carpets; they appear to have been sessile benthos attached either to the biohermal substrate or to soft-bodied macrobenthos such as seaweeds that grew on the reef surface. The phylogenetic affinities of Namacalathus are uncertain, although preserved morphology is consistent with a cnidarian-like bodyplan. In general aspect, these fossils resemble some of the unmineralized, radially symmetric taxa found in contemporaneous sandstones and shales, but do not appear to be closely related to the well-skeletonized bilaterian animals that radiated in younger oceans. Nama reefs demonstrate that biohermal associations of invertebrates and thrombolite-forming microorganisms antedate the Cambrian Period.},

abstract = {Calcite pseudomorphs after ikaite (glendonite) are associated with coldwater depositional systems, including glaciomarine and deepwater settings, as dictated by the limited stability field of ikaite. Ikaite precipitation is favored by elevated alkalinity and dissolved phosphate, conditions encountered commonly in association with organic-rich marine sediments where methane oxidation is occurring. The rapid recrystallization of ikaite to calcite during slight warming or pressure release results in considerable solid volume loss, producing a highly porous crystal mesh. Preservation of the original ikaite crystal form requires precipitation of diagenetic calcite cement during early burial to prevent compaction and collapse of pseudomorph structures. During later burial diagenesis remaining pore space may be filled with deeper burial calcite cement. Glendonites from the Permian of the Sydney Basin occur in subtidal shelf facies containing glacial dropstones and a normal marine fauna. Stable oxygen isotope signatures of modern ikaite suggest carbonate precipitation in equilibrium with ambient seawater; carbon signatures are usually strongly negative relative to normal marine carbonate, consistent with derivation of carbonate from methane oxidation. Review of published data suggests that while Holocene glendonite may provide reliable isotopic records of the conditions of ikaite precipitation, precipitation of later calcite cement within the glendonite structure reduces the significance of the isotopic signature as an indicator of primary depositional conditions. Bulk glendonite samples from the Permian Sydney Basin, Australia, have a broad range of {\{}delta{\}}18 O and {\{}delta{\}}13C ({\{}delta{\}}18OPDB = -5 to -15{\{}per thousand{\}}; {\{}delta{\}}13C = -8 to -16{\{}per thousand{\}}), in contrast to the narrow range for brachiopod carbonate ({\{}delta{\}}18OPDB = +1 to -5{\{}per thousand{\}}; {\{}delta{\}}13C = +5 to +7{\{}per thousand{\}}) from the same strata. Handpicked separates of "primary" glendonite and secondary calcite also have a wide range of stable isotope values. The data from Sydney Basin glendonites indicate that diagenetic precipitation of calcite has blurred the isotopic signature of primary ikaite replacement calcite at the scale of micosampling done in this study.},

abstract = {Carbon and oxygen isotope measurements were made in bulk sediments from the five sites drilled on Leg 74, cover-ing much of the Cenozoic. These stable carbon isotope analyses document a lightening across the Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary (already docu-mented by other workers), with a minimum about 0.2 Ma after the boundary; a trend to very heavy values in the late Paleocene; a lightening near the Paleocene/Eocene boundary to a second minimum early in the early Eocene; more positive values in the remainder of the Eocene with a minor peak immediately below the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, at which there is a lightening trend; a moderately positive peak in the middle Miocene, and a lightening toward the pres-ent, where the isotopically lightest values in the Cenozoic are to be found. The carbon isotope variations observed are largely a function of changes in the 13 C content of oceanic dissolved inorganic carbon that resulted from alterations in the global carbon budget. Slight differences among sediments of the same age at different sites probably result from diagenetic changes, but do not obscure the major pattern, which has considerable potential value for stratigraphic cor-relation.},

abstract = {We used sediment traps to define the particulate fluxes of barium and organic carbon and investigate the use of barium as a proxy for ocean fertility. Strong correlations between C-org and Ba fluxes indicate a link between upper ocean biological processes and barium flux to the seafloor. The ratio of organic carbon to barium decreases systematically with water depth. Data from 10 sites indicate that organic debris settling from the 200-m depth has a C-org/Ba ratio of approximately 200. The systematic decrease in this ratio with increasing water depth results from the simultaneous decay of organic matter and uptake of Ba in settling particles. This behavior provides additional evidence that the formation of in oceanic particles is a consequence of decomposition/uptake in microenvironments rather than the secretion of barite by specific organisms. The decrease of the Corg/Ba ratio with depth is greatest in the North Pacific followed by the equatorial Pacific and is lowest in the western Atlantic. Since this spatial pattern in consistent with the variations in the deep-ocean barium contents which increase along the path of bottom water flow from the Atlantic to the North Pacific, it suggests that the particulate barium uptake and flux is enhanced by higher barium contents in the intermediate and deep waters of the ocean. Consequently, we have combined our particle flux data with existing water column Ba data to define an algorithm relating new productivity, dissolved barium contents, water depth, and particulate barium flux. This relationship provides a basis of applying barium flux measurements in sediments to estimating new production. In order to use barium as an indicator of productivity, it will be necessary to evaluate inputs from hydrothermal and aluminosilicate sources and xenophyophors. The application of a sequential leach procedure to the trap material indicates that 50-70{\%} of the Ba in settling particles is in the form of barite and the remaining is adsorbed or bound to carbonates. Normative analysis demonstrates that in nearshore areas the contribution of barium from aluminosilicate sources can dominate that from biogenic inputs. It appears that normative estimates of biogenic barium contents can be made with accuracy if less than 50{\%} of the Ba is associated with diagenetic mobilization of Ba can occur in reduced and suboxic sediments, highly productive nearshore areas also are likely to be inappropriate sites to use Ba measurements as productivity indicators. Comparisons between the rain rates of particulate Ba to the seafloor and the burial rate indicate the approximately 30{\%} of the Ba rain is preserved. Although the preservation factor does not appear to be constant, it may be possible to predict the extent of preservation from an empirical relationship with the mass accumulation rate. These observations indicate that measurement of Ba burial fluxes in sediments can provide quantitative information on the paleoproductivity of the oceans. Joining the relationship between barium rain and burial with the barium and organic carbon algorithm, we make estimate of the new production in the northern California Current during the last 18,000 years. This calculation suggests that new production was at least a factor 2 lower at this site during the last glacial maximum.},

abstract = {Large impacts are credited with the most devastating mass extinctions in Earth's history and the Cretaceous – Tertiary (K/T) boundary impact is the strongest and sole direct support for this view. A review of the five largest Phanerozoic mass extinctions provides no support that impacts with craters up to 180 km in diameter caused significant species extinctions. This includes the 170 km-diameter Chicxulub impact crater regarded as 0.3 million years older than the K/T mass extinction. A second, larger impact event may have been the ultimate cause of this mass extinction, as suggested by a global iridium anomaly at the K/T boundary, but no crater has been found to date. The current crater database suggests that multiple impacts, for example comet showers, were the norm, rather than the exception, during the Late Eocene, K/T transition, latest Triassic and the Devonian – Carboniferous transition, but did not cause significant species extinctions. Whether multiple impacts substantially contributed to greenhouse warming and associated environmental stresses is yet to be demonstrated. From the current database, it must be concluded that no known Phanerozoic impacts, including the Chicxulub impact (but excluding the K/T impact) caused mass extinctions or even significant species extinctions. The K/T mass extinction may have been caused by the coincidence of a very large impact (4250 km) upon a highly stressed biotic environment as a result of volcanism. The consistent association of large magmatic provinces (large igneous provinces and continental flood-basalt provinces) with all but one (end-Ordovician) of the five major Phanerozoic mass extinctions suggests that volcanism played a major role. Faunal and geochemical evidence from the end-Permian, end- Devonian, end-Cretaceous and Triassic/Jurassic transition suggests that the biotic stress was due to a lethal combination of tectonically induced hydrothermal and volcanic processes, leading to eutrophication in the oceans, global warming, sea-level transgression and ocean anoxia. It must be concluded that major magmatic events and their long-term environmental consequences are major contributors, though not the sole causes of mass extinctions. Sudden mass extinctions, such as at the K/T boundary, may require the coincidence of major volcanism and a very large Impact.},

Reexamination of distinctive phyllosilicates, unique to a single stratigraphic level, in paleosols located just above the isotopically defined Permian-Triassic boundary in Australia and Antarctica furnishes additional tests of this hypothesis. Illite is the dominant clay mineral in earliest Triassic paleosols from Antarctica, but the palleosols also contain conspicuous green nodules of coarsely crystalline berthierine. Examples from the geologic record and from experimental studies indicate that the formation of berthierine is restricted to reducing conditions. The occurrence of this unusual mineral in soils may indicate soil oxygen consumption by the influx of atmospheric methane to form carbon dioxide, which in turn warmed the earliest Triassic, giving rise to a postapocalyptic greenhouse.},

abstract = {In the early 1980s, ocean scientists were increasingly aware of the importance of biologically active elements, such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, in the regulation of climate and its effects on the habitability of the planet. As scientists reviewed details of the processes that control ocean carbon cycling and the links among oceanic, atmospheric and sedimentary carbon pools, it was clear that it was "hard to make the numbers add up" (Brewer et al., 1986). Fluxes of carbon into and out of the ocean were only crudely constrained, and little detail existed on the seasonal, regional and global patterns of carbon uptake and export or the flux of carbon between the ocean and its boundaries. The U.S. Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS), a component of the U.S. Global Change Research Program, grew out of the recommendations of a National Academy of Sciences workshop, held in Woods Hole in September 1984. The international program of which it is part was launched three years later under the auspices of the Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research. In 1989, as the first field studies were getting underway, JGOFS became a core project of the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme.},

In aquatic organisms, O-18/O-16 ratios in the shell carbonate are a function of the ratio in the sea water and the calcification temperature(1). In contrast, C-13/C-12 ratios are controlled by the ratio of dissolved inorganic carbon in sea water and physiological processes such as respiration and symbiont photosynthesis', These geochemical proxies have been used with analyses of foraminifera shells to reconstruct global ice volumes(3), surface and deep ocean temperatures(4,5), ocean circulation changes(6) and glacial-interglacial exchange between the terrestrial and oceanic carbon pools(7). Here, we report experimental measurements on living symbiotic and non-symbiotic plankton foraminifera (Orbulina universa and Globigerina bulloides respectively) showing that the C-13/C-12 and O-18/O-16 ratios of the calcite shells decrease with increasing seawater CO32-. Because glacial-period oceans had higher pH and CO32- than today(8), these new relationships confound the standard interpretation of glacial foraminiferal stable-isotope data In particular, the hypothesis that the glacial-interglacial shift in the C-13/C-12 ratio was due to a transfer of terrestrial carbon into the ocean(7) can be explained alternatively by an increase in ocean alkalinity(25). A carbonate-concentration effect could also help explain some of the extreme stable-isotope variations during the Proterozoic and Phanerozoic aeons(9)},

abstract = {The Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) was a significant global warming event in the Earth's history (approx. 55 Ma). The cause for this warming event has been linked to increases in greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide and methane. This rapid warming took place in the presence of the existing Early Eocene warm climate. Given that projected business-as-usual levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide reach concentrations of 800–1100 ppmv by 2100, it is of interest to study past climates where atmospheric carbon dioxide was higher than present. This is especially the case given the difficulty of climate models in simulating past warm climates. This study explores the sensitivity of the simulated pre-PETM and PETM periods to change in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and microphysical properties of liquid water clouds. Assuming lower levels of CCN for both of these periods leads to significant warming, especially at high latitudes. The study indicates that past differences in cloud properties may be an important factor in accurately simulating past warm climates. Importantly, additional shortwave warming from such a mechanism would imply lower required atmospheric CO2 concentrations for simulated surface temperatures to be in reasonable agreement with proxy data for the Eocene.},

abstract = {The Mesozoic Era is characterized by numerous oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) that are diagnostically expressed by widespread marine organic-carbon burial and coeval carbon-isotope excursions. Here we present coupled high-resolution carbon- and sulfur-isotope data from four European OAE 2 sections spanning the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary that show roughly parallel positive excursions. Significantly, however, the interval of peak magnitude for carbon isotopes precedes that of sulfur isotopes with an estimated offset of a few hundred thousand years. Based on geochemical box modeling of organic-carbon and pyrite burial, the sulfur-isotope excursion can be generated by transiently increasing the marine burial rate of pyrite precipitated under euxinic (i.e., anoxic and sulfidic) water-column conditions. To replicate the observed isotopic offset, the model requires that enhanced levels of organic-carbon and pyrite burial continued a few hundred thousand years after peak organic-carbon burial, but that their isotope records responded differently due to dramatically different residence times for dissolved inorganic carbon and sulfate in seawater. The significant inference is that euxinia persisted post-OAE, but with its global extent dwindling over this time period. The model further suggests that only {\~{}}5{\%} of the global seafloor area was overlain by euxinic bottom waters during OAE 2. Although this figure is {\~{}}30× greater than the small euxinic fraction present today ({\~{}}0.15{\%}), the result challenges previous suggestions that one of the best-documented OAEs was defined by globally pervasive euxinic deep waters. Our results place important controls instead on local conditions and point to the difficulty in sustaining whole-ocean euxinia.},

abstract = {Recently, a novel "electrogenic" type of sulfur oxidation has been documented in marine sediments, whereby long filamentous cable bacteria are generating electrical currents over centimeter-scale distances. Here we propose a numerical model description that is capable of quantitatively simulating the solute depth profiles and biogeochemical transformations in such electro-active marine sediments. The model is based on a conventional reactive transport description of marine sediments, which is extended with a new model formulation for the long-distance electron transport induced by the cable bacteria. The mechanism of electron hopping is implemented to describe the electron transport along the longitudinal axis of the microbial filaments. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing the observed geochemical fingerprint of electrogenic sulfur oxidation, which consists of a characteristic set of O2, pH and H2S depth profiles. Our simulation results suggest that the cable bacteria must have a high affinity for both oxygen and sulfide, and that intensive cryptic sulfur cycling takes place within the suboxic zone. A sensitivity analysis shows how electrogenic sulfur oxidation strongly impacts the biogeochemical cycling of sulfur, iron, carbon and calcium in marine sediments.},

Error from shot noise Even if detection, amplification and signal conversion in isotope ratio measurements were completely free of noise and fractionating effects, there would still be a limit to the maximum attainable precision of isotopic data. This limit is posed by shot noise, a consequence of the discrete nature of electronic charge (whether it is carried by electrons or ions). The statistical error from shot noise is rarely a concern in standard bulk isotope measurements, but due to the low number of ions detected and limited chance for reanalysis from measuring individual cells in secondary ion mass spectrometry, this error estimate provides an important constraint on precision. This is particularly relevant for small analytical targets, in measurements of ions from low abundance elements, ions with low ionization efficiency or with rare minor isotopes. Error from shot noise in ion counts and raw isotope ratios The number of ions N observed at a detector in a fixed time interval t follows a Poisson distribution (i.e., a discrete probability distribution of independent events occurring with an average rate of a). The corresponding probability mass function is f (N) = P (X = N) = (at) N e −at N !. The expected value E[N ] = ¯ N (mean) of a Poisson distribution is ¯ N = at (for a fixed time interval t). The variance V ar[N ] of a Poisson distribution is identical to the expected value, and hence the standard deviation $\sigma$ N scales with the square root of ¯ N ($\sigma$ N = √ V ar[N ] = √ ¯ N). In secondary ion mass spectrometry, analytical targets are typically analyzed in several passes over the same area generating ion images that consist of multiple planes. For small targets and/or low ion currents, individual passes},

abstract = {In the Wadi Wasit area (Central Oman Mountains), Dienerian breccias are widespread. These breccias consist mostly of Guadalupian reefal blocks, often dolomitised, and some rare small-sized blocks of lowermost Triassic bivalve-bearing limestones. A unique block, with a size of about 200 m(3), including Permian and earliest Triassic faunas has been studied in detail. The so-called Wadi Wasit block consists of three major lithological units. A basal unstratified grey limestone is rich in various reef-building organisms (rugose corals, calcareous sponges, stromatoporoids) and has been dated as Middle Permian. It is disconformably overlain by well- and thin-bedded light grey to yellowish coloured limestones rich in molluscs. Two major lithologies (Coquina Limestone respectively Bioclastic Limestone unit) characterise the shelly limestones, their contact seems gradual. These two units are well-dated; they are of Griesbachian age and contain three conodont zones, the Parvus Zone, the Staeschei Zone and the Sosioensis Zone, and two ammonoid zones, the Ophiceras tibeticum Zone and an 'unnamed interval'. The third unit consists of a grey marly limestone containing Neospathodus kummeli (basal Dienerian). It is the first record of well-dated basal Triassic sediments in the Arabian Peninsula. The Coquina Limestone is dominated by the bivalve Promyalina with some Claraia and Eumorphotis. This bivalve association is interpreted as a pioneering opportunistic assemblage. Towards the top of the Bioclastic Limestone unit, the faunal diversity increases and contains probably more than 20 taxa of bivalves, microgastropods, crinoids, brachiopods, ammonoids, echinoid spines, ostracods and conodonts. The generic diversity of this biofacies exceeds by far any other Griesbachian assemblage known. Our data give new evidence for the geodynamical history for the distal carbonate shelf bordering the Hawasina Basin. A break in the sedimentation characterises the Late Permian. The basal Triassic shows a steady transgression and the breccias may record a distinct gravitational collapse of platform margins linked with sea-level low stand at the end of Induan time (late Dienerian-basal Smithian). delta(13)C(carb) isotopic analyses were performed and yield typical Permian values of around 4parts per thousand for the Reefal Limestone, with a strong negative shift across the Permian-Triassic boundary. During the Griesbachian values shift positively from 0.5 to 3.1parts per thousand parallel to an increase in faunal diversity and probably primary productivity. The detailed faunal analysis and the discovery of an unexpected diversity give,us a new understanding of the recovery of the Early Triassic marine ecosystem.

However, the factors governing the major sulfur fluxes between seawater and sedimentary reservoirs remain incompletely understood. Using macrostratigraphic data, we quantified sulfate evaporite burial fluxes through Phanerozoic time. Approximately half of the modern riverine sulfate flux comes from weathering of recently deposited evaporites. Rates of sulfate burial are unsteady and linked to changes in the area of marine environments suitable for evaporite formation and preservation. By contrast, rates of pyrite burial and weathering are higher, less variable, and largely balanced, highlighting a greater role of the sulfur cycle in regulating atmospheric oxygen.},

Replicate measurements of untreated and acid-treated samples were made using 1 M, 2 M and 6 M HCl, 6{\%} H2SO3 and 1 M H3PO4. For all treatments the precision of the analysis for the acid-treated sample was equal to or less than that in the non-acidified sample. For the algae, analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated no significant differences in the mean OC and TN concentration, or delta13C and delta15N composition, between any acid treatment and non-acidified samples. For the sediment sample a comparison could only be made between the different acid treatments because the untreated contained significant amounts ( approximately 30{\%}) of carbonate carbon. ANOVA indicated that the mean OC determined in sediment samples after the 1 M HCl treatment and the mean delta13C values after the 6{\%} H2SO3 and 1 M H3PO4 treatments were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.013 and {\textless} .05, respectively) from all other treatments. Mass balance calculations indicate that in some instances delta13C values were biased due to a contribution from unreacted carbonate carbon. There were no significant differences in the mean TN between any acid-treated and non-acidified samples. The mean delta15N values after 6 M HCl, 6{\%} H2SO3 and 1 M H3PO4 treatments were significantly different from the untreated sediment sample (p {\textless} 0.044). Based on the significant bias observed for the delta15N and delta13C values, a weak (1-2 M) HCl solution is confirmed as the most appropriate acid for the removal of inorganic carbon from natural materials requiring elemental and isotopic analysis.},

abstract = {Petroleum source rocks are strongly enriched in organic carbon (OC), and their trace metal (TM) contents often reach low-grade ore levels. The mechanisms leading to these coenrichments are important for understanding how extreme environmental conditions support the formation of natural resources. We therefore studied organic-rich Eocene marls and limestones (oil shale) from the central Jordan Amzaq-Hazra subbasin, part of a Cretaceous–Paleogene shelf system along the southern Neo-Tethys margin. Geochemical analyses on two cores show highly dynamic depositional conditions, consistent with sedimentological and micropaleontological observations. Maximum and average contents, respectively, in OC (∼26 and ∼10 wt{\%}), sulfur (∼7 and ∼2.4 wt{\%}), phosphorus (∼10 and ∼2 wt{\%}), molybdenum ({\textgreater}400 and ∼130 ppm), chromium ({\textgreater}500 and ∼350 ppm), vanadium ({\textgreater}1600 and ∼550 ppm) and zinc ({\textgreater}3800 and ∼900 ppm) are exceptional, in particular without any indication of hydrothermal or epigenetic processes. We propose a combination of two processes: physical reworking of OC- and metal-rich material from locally exposed Cretaceous–Paleogene sediments (as supported by reworked nannofossils), and high marine productivity fueled by chemical remobilization of nutrients and metals on land that sustained anoxic-sulfidic conditions. Burial of high-quality organic matter (hydrogen index 600–700 mgHC/gOC) was related to strongly reducing conditions, punctuated by only short-lived oxygenation events, and to excess H2S, promoting organic matter sulfurization. These processes likely caused the OC and TM coenrichments in a high-energy shallow-marine setting that contradicts common models for black shale formation, but may explain similar geochemical patterns in other black shales.{\%}U http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/geology/44/12/1011.full.pdf},

abstract = {The shergottite and ALH84001 meteorites hold keys for understanding geologic and possibly biologic processes on Mars. Recently, it has been proposed that carbonates in ALH84001, and the Fe-sulfides they contain, are products of extraterrestrial biogenic activity (McKay et al., 1996). Here we report ion microprobe analyses of sulfides in shergottites and ALH84001. The sulfur isotope ratios of igneous pyrrhotites in shergottites (mean delta(34)S(CDT):Shergotty = -0.4 parts per thousand, Zagami = +2.7 parts per thousand, EETA79001A = -1.9 parts per thousand, EETA79001B = -1.7 parts per thousand, LEW88516 = -1.9 parts per thousand, QUE94201 = +0.8 parts per thousand) are similar to those of terrestrial ocean-floor basalts, suggesting that the sulfur isotopic composition of the Martian mantle may be similar to that of the mantle of the Earth. The sulfur isotopic systematics of ALH84001 sulfides are distinct from the shergottites. Measured sulfur isotope ratios of eight pyrite grains (delta(34)S(CDT) = +2.0 to +7.3 parts per thousand) in crushed zones confirm previously reported analyses of isotopically heavy sulfides (Shearer et al., 1996) and are indistinguishable from an Fe-sulfide zone within a carbonate globule (delta(34)S(CDT) = +6.0 parts per thousand). Analyses of synthesized, fine-grained mixtures of sulfide, carbonate, and magnetite indicate that the measured sulfur isotope ratio is independent of the presence of carbonate and magnetite in the sputtered volume, confirming the accuracy of the analysis of the fine-grained sulfide in the carbonate globule. Terrestrial biogenic sulfate reduction typically results in light isotopic enrichments. The similarity of delta(34)S values of the sulfides in ALH84001 imply that the Fe-sulfide zones within ALH84001 carbonates are probably not the result of bacterial reduction of sulfate.

abstract = {The $\delta$13C value of plant tissue is increasingly used to infer environmental and ecological conditions in modern and ancient environments. Isolation techniques and morphological descriptions have been established that characterize plant pollen for the greater part of the Phanerozoic eon. If the $\delta$13C value of fossil pollen could be used as an indicator of the carbon isotope composition of ancient pollinating communities, it could provide insight into ancient paleoenvironments. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the $\delta$13C value of pollen and the $\delta$13C value of bulk plant tissue in a few isolated species; this study sought to quantify the isotopic relationship between modern pollen and stem and leaf tissues across all the major phylogenetic clades of the tracheophytes. One-hundred and seventy-five different species of tracheophytes were collected from 11 arboreta and botanical gardens across the United States and analyzed for $\delta$13C value of pollen, leaf, and stem tissue. The carbon isotope difference between pollen and leaf tissue values in the same species was =±3.00‰ for {\textgreater}90{\%} of data pairs, and the same relationship was true for comparisons between pollen and stem tissue. When the data was examined by phylogenetic clade, it was found that some groups, such as the Cornales and Ericales, exhibited a much closer and more consistent correlation between pollen and stem and leaf tissue. It was also noted that green-stemmed clades tended to show $\delta$13Cstem{\textless}$\delta$13Cpollenwhile woody-stemmed clades showed the opposite ($\delta$13Cpollen{\textless}$\delta$13Cstem), a difference attributable to the different chemical composition of the two types of stem tissue. The chemical preparation method involving Schulze's solution that is commonly employed to isolate pollen from pre-Quaternary sediments was shown not to affect the carbon isotope composition of pollen by more than 0.23‰. The manual isolation of sufficient pollen from the fossil record for $\delta$13C analysis of a single species would be prohibitively laborious; however, these results showed that when understood in terms of paleobotanical taxonomy, $\delta$13C analyses of bulk fossil pollen can be used to infer the $\delta$13C value of the ancient plant community to within 1.5‰. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {One of the most fundamental enigmas of the Earth's palaeo-climate concerns the temporal and spatial distributions of Precambrian glaciations. Through four billion years of Precambrian history, unequivocally glacial deposits have been found only in the Palaeoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic record(1). Nonetheless, some of these deposits are closely associated with tropical- rather than just polar-palaeolatitudinal indicators such as carbonate rocks, red beds, and evaporites(1,2). These observations are quantitatively supported by palaeomagnetic results indicating a similar to 5 degrees latitude for Neoproterozoic glaciogenic rocks in Australia(3-5). Similarly reliable palaeolatitudes for the older, Palaeoproterozoic glaciogenic rocks have not yet been obtained, as such deposits commonly suffer from poor preservation and secondary magnetic overprinting. The Archaean-Palaeoproterozoic 'Transvaal Supergroup' on the Kaapvaal craton in South Africa is, however, exceptionally well preserved, and is thus amenable to the palaeomagnetic determination of depositional palaeolatitudes. Within this supergroup the similar to 2.2 billion-year old Ongeluk lavas are a regionally extensive, largely undeformed and unmetamorphosed, extrusive volcanic succession(6), which conformably overlies glaciogenic deposits (the Makganyene diamictite). Here we report a palaeomagnetic estimate of 11 5 degrees depositional latitude for the lavas, and hence for the underlying contemporaneous glacial rocks. The palaeoclimate enigma is thus deepened; a largely ice-free Precambrian world was apparently punctuated by two long ice ages, both yielding glacial deposits well within tropical latitudes.},

abstract = {A comprehensive approach using palaeontology, petrography, stable isotope geochemistry and biomarker analyses was applied to the study of seven small methane-seep carbonate deposits. These deposits are in the Oligocene part of the Lincoln Creek Formation, exposed along the Canyon and Satsop Rivers in western Washington. Each deposit preserves invertebrate fossils, many representing typical seep biota. Authigenic carbonates with $\delta$13C values as low as -51‰ PDB reveal that the carbon is predominately methane derived. Carbonates contain the irregular isoprenoid hydrocarbons 2,6,11,15-tetramethylhexadecane (crocetane) and 2,6,10,15,19-pentamethylicosane (PMI), lipid biomarkers diagnostic for archaea. These lipids are strongly depleted in 13C ($\delta$13C values as low as -120‰ PDB), indicating that archaea were involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Small filaments preserved in the carbonate may represent methanotrophic archaea. Archaeal methanogenesis induced the formation of a late diagenetic phase, brownish calcite, consisting of dumbbell-shaped crystal aggregates that exhibit $\delta$13C values as high as +7‰ PDB. Clotted microfabrics of primary origin point to microbial mediation of carbonate precipitation. Downward-directed carbonate aggregation in the seeps produced inverted stromatactoid cavities. Large filaments, interpreted as green algae based on their size, shape, arrangement and biomarkers, imply that deposition occurred, in places, in water no deeper than 210 m.},

We show that the overall magnitude of the $\delta$18O shift is smaller than previously thought (1-1.5‰ vs 6 ‰).Expanding on previous work, we explore the effects of Quaternary sea level variations on the global sulfur cycle. Our modeling results confirm the earlier hypothesis that the increased duration and amplitude of sea level lowstands during the Quaternary favors direct sulfide oxidation over microbial disproportionation. We show that oxygen isotope ratios of core top barite are up to 2.5‰ lower than the seawater sulfate $\delta$18O value. We hypothesize that this offset is caused by incorporation of sulfate from oxidized organic sulfur compounds during precipitation of barite. Our results provide another puzzle piece in the attempt to understand the origin of marine barite.},

abstract = {We have examined the relative affinity of Th, Pa and Be for sorption from seawater onto particles of variable composition (opal, carbonate, lithogenic particles and organic carbon). Nuclide concentrations in particles collected from time-series sediment traps were normalized by the dissolved nuclide concentration in the overlying water column in order to compute partition coefficients under conditions spanning a wide range of particle flux and particle composition. Our results suggest that the affinity of particles for Pa and Be increases with their increasing opal content and decreasing carbonate content, while the affinity of particles for Th increases with increasing carbonate content, and decreases with increasing opal content. We find no correlation between the aluminosilicate content of particles and their affinity for scavenging of any of these elements. Extrapolating to a pure CaCO3 end member, the partition coefficient for Th (9.0 x 10(6) g g(-1)) is similar to40 times greater than for Pa, and roughly 100 times greater than for Be, whereas for a pure opal end member, the partition coefficient for Th (3.9 x 10(5) g g(-1)) is slightly less than that for Pa and Be. Partition coefficients decrease with increasing particle flux in open-ocean settings, but not in an ocean-margin region. This kinetic effect reflects the increasing contribution of unaltered surface material reaching the sediment traps as particle flux increases. The degree of fractionation between Pa and Th and between Be and Th depends on the opal:carbonate rain ratio. These results challenge the use of sedimentary Pa-231/Th-230 and Be-10/Th-230 ratios as simple proxies of particle flux. However, the strong dependence of nuclide scavenging on the opal:carbonate rain ratio may provide a needed tool for reconstructing past changes in planktonic community composition.

abstract = {This review shows that thermodynamic and kinetic constraints largely prevent large-scale methanogenesis in the open ocean water column. One example of open-ocean methanogenesis involves anoxic digestive tracts and fecal pellet microenvironments; methane released during fecal pellet disaggregation results in the mixed-layer methane maximum. However, the bulk of the methane in the ocean is added by coastal runoff, seeps, hydrothermal vents, decomposing hydrates, and mud volcanoes. Since methane is present in the open ocean at nanomolar concentrations, and since the flux to the atmosphere is small, the ultimate fate of ocean methane additions must be oxidation within the ocean. As indicated in the Introduction and highlighted in Table 3, sources of methane to the ocean water column are poorly quantified. There are only a small number of direct water column methane oxidation rates, so sinks are also poorly quantified. We know that methane oxidation rates are sensitive to ambient methane concentrations, but we have no information on reaction kinetics and only one report of the effect of pressure on methane oxidation. Our perspective on methane sources and the extent of methane oxidation has been changed dramatically by new techniques involving gene probes, determination of isotopically depleted biomarkers, and recent 14 C-CH 4 measurements showing that methane geochemistry in anoxic basins is dominated by seeps providing fossil methane. The role of anaerobic oxidation of methane has changed from a controversial curiosity to a major sink in anoxic basins and sediments. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The Ligurian cycle has a duration approximately equivalent to Early Jurassic times. This major transgressive/regressive facies cycle is characterized by several rifting events that are related to the development of the Ligurian Tethys. Its onset is marked by the Early Cimmerian unconformity dated as latest Norian. Its end corresponds to the Mid-Cimmerian unconformity, dated as Late Toarcian (Stille, 1924), which preceded the late Aalenian major regression linked with tectonic uplift known in many areas of northern Europe. One result of this uplift phase was the coeval rapid and major subsidence phase that allowed the accumulation of thick successions in the major half-grabens of the nascent Tethyan margin. The Ligurian cycle can be subdivided into three or four 2nd-order facies cycles, depending on the local tectonic development in the area. The whole cycle comprises 27 3rd-order depositional sequence cycles. These can be dated locally to the precision of an ammonite ‐{\oe}horizon‐ . Our sections are located along a north-south transect, from the Hebrides basin in the northern U.K. to the Alpes Maritimes in southern France. The study areas are located in the southeastern France Basin (now involved in Subalpine folding), the Causses (southern Massif Central of France), the Quercy (eastern Aquitaine) and the Paris Basin. These are compared with the Wessex, Cleveland and Hebrides basin in the U.K. Documentation is provided by ammonite biostratigraphic studies and outcrop and subsurface data. Such data have been reinterpreted using sequence-stratigraphic methodologies. One of the key results is that the 3rd-order depositional sequences that are the building blocks of the longer term cycles are correlatable units the entire western European craton.},

abstract = {We describe variations in trace element compositions that occurred on the deep seafloor of palaeo-superocean Panthalassa during the end-Permian mass extinction based on samples of sedimentary rock from one of the most continuous Permian-Triassic boundary sections of the pelagic deep sea exposed in north-eastern Japan. Our measurements revealed low manganese (Mn) enrichment factor (normalised by the composition of the average upper continental crust) and high cerium anomaly values throughout the section, suggesting that a reducing condition already existed in the depositional environment in the Changhsingian (Late Permian). Other redox-sensitive trace-element (vanadium [V], chromium [Cr], molybdenum [Mo], and uranium [U]) enrichment factors provide a detailed redox history ranging from the upper Permian to the end of the Permian. A single V increase (representing the first reduction state of a two-step V reduction process) detected in uppermost Changhsingian chert beds suggests development into a mildly reducing deep-sea condition less than 1 million years before the end-Permian mass extinction. Subsequently, a more reducing condition, inferred from increases in Cr, V, and Mo, developed in overlying Changhsingian grey siliceous claystone beds. The most reducing sulphidic condition is recognised by the highest peaks of Mo and V (second reduction state) in the uppermost siliceous claystone and overlying lowermost black claystone beds, in accordance with the end-Permian mass extinction event. This significant increase in Mo in the upper Changhsingian led to a high Mo/U ratio, much larger than that of modern sulphidic ocean regions. This trend suggests that sulphidic water conditions developed both at the sediment-water interface and in the water column. Above the end-Permian mass extinction horizon, Mo, V and Cr decrease significantly. On this trend, we provide an interpretation of drawdown of these elements in seawater after the massive element precipitation event during the end-Permian maximum development of the reducing water column. A decrease in the Mo/U ratio despite enrichment of Mo and U also supports that of Mo. Calculations of the total amounts of these elements precipitated compared with the global seawater inventory suggest that when more than 6-10{\%} of the global ocean became euxinic as much as the study section, most of the dissolved elements would precipitate into sediments, resulting in a global element-depleted seawater condition. Mo, V, and Cr act as bioessential elements for both primary producers and animals. The continuing reducing water column and the lack of bioessential elements could have had a considerable effect on primary producer turnover and marine life metabolism not only in the pelagic environment, but also in surrounding marine environments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Newly discovered zones of reverse polarity within CAMP flow sequences of Morocco have been hypothesized by Marzoli et al. [Marzoli, A., Bertrand, H., Knight, K.B., Cirilli, S., Buratti, N., V{\'{e}}rati, C., Nomade, S., Renne, P.R., Youbi, N., Martini, R., Allenbach, K., Neuwerth, R., Rapaille, C., Zaninetti, L., Bellieni, G., 2004.

Earth and Planetary Science Letters 228, 143-160.] as correlates of a very short, uppermost Triassic age reverse chron in the Newark basin, thus suggesting that much of the Moroccan CAMP was synchronous with or predates the Triassic-Jurassic boundary. Here, however, we explain these apparent reverse polarity zones as possible correlatives of poorly sampled lower Jurassic basalt flow sequences and overlying strata in eastern North America and lower Jurassic reverse polarity sequences recognized by others in the Paris basin. A revised Milankovitch cyclostratigraphy based on new core and field data constrains the duration of eastern North America basaltic flows to ∼ 610 ky after the Triassic-Jurassic palynological turnover event. Palynological data indicates correlation of the initial carbon isotopic excursion of Hesselbo et al. [Hesselbo, S.P., Robinson, S.A., Surlyk, F., Piasecki, S., 2002.

We conclude that as yet there are no compelling data showing that any of the CAMP predated or was synchronous with the Triassic-Jurassic extinction event. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The distribution of barium (Ba) concentrations in seawater resembles that of nutrients and Ba has been widely used as a proxy of paleoproductivity. However, the exact mechanisms controlling the nutrient-like behavior, and thus the fundamentals of Ba chemistry in the ocean, have not been fully resolved. Here we present a set of full water column dissolved Ba (DBa) isotope ($\delta$ 137BaDBa) profiles from the South China Sea and the East China Sea that receives large freshwater inputs from the Changjiang (Yangtze River). We find pronounced and systematic horizontal and depth dependent $\delta$ 137BaDBa gradients. Beyond the river influence characterized by generally light signatures (0.0 to +0.3‰), the $\delta$ 137BaDBa values in the upper water column are significantly higher (+0.9‰) than those in the deep waters (+0.5‰). Moreover, $\delta$ 137BaDBa signatures are essentially constant in the entire upper 100 m, in which dissolved silicon isotopes are fractionated during diatom growth resulting in the heaviest isotopic compositions in the very surface waters. Combined with the decoupling of DBa concentrations and $\delta$ 137BaDBa from the concentrations of nitrate and phosphate this implies that the apparent nutrient-like fractionation of Ba isotopes in seawater is primarily induced by preferential adsorption of the lighter isotopes onto biogenic particles rather than by biological utilization. The subsurface $\delta$ 137BaDBa distribution is dominated by water mass mixing. The application of stable Ba isotopes as a proxy for nutrient cycling should therefore be considered with caution and both biological and physical processes need to be considered. Clearly, however, Ba isotopes show great potential as a new tracer for land-sea interactions and ocean mixing processes.},

abstract = {Anoxic marine sediments are usually characterized by systematic decrease in concentration of dissolved sulfate in the pore waters of marine sediments. This depletion in dissolved sulfate can take place over depth scales ranging from a few centimeters up to a few hundred meters. Accompanying the decrease in sulfate concentration is an increase in ??34S, due to preferential utilization of the 32S -isotope during bacterial sulfate reduction. The degree of 34S-enrichment for a given degree of dissolved sulfate depletion is also highly variable, and reflects the extent to which the sediment column is relatively open or closed with respect to diffusive replenishment of sulfate during bacterial sulfate reduction. Gradients in stable sulfur isotope ratios (34S/32S ) and concentration of dissolved sulfate in pore waters of marine sediments with negligible advective sulfate supply have been compiled from 42 sites of the Deep Sea Drilling Project and the Ocean Drilling Program, Legs 4 through 188.The linear sedimentation rates for the sites range from about 5 to 1500 m per million years. The apparent 34S-enrichment factors (from Rayleigh equation) vary from 4 to 72{\%} (?? = 1.004-1.072), and are directly proportional to a system "openness" parameter (i.e. the diffusive sulfate flux divided by the combined diffusive plus burial fluxes), which ranges from 0.06 to 0.87. Under conditions represented by the DSDP/ODP cores in this study, microbial sulfate reduction occurs at very slow rates with a relatively large 34S-isotopic enrichment (75{\%}). This large fractionation is diluted by variable degrees of diffusive replenishment with relatively unfractionated seawater sulfate. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Glendonites are pseudomorphs of the mineral ikaite (CaCO3{\textperiodcentered}6H2O) after loss of hydration water and occur in distinctive euhedral crystalline forms, sometimes clustered as rosettes of up to tens of centimeters in diameter. While it is generally accepted that organic-rich environments, methane seeps, and high phosphate levels are important for ikaite formation, glendonite occurrences in ancient sedimentary sequences are widely considered to reflect near-freezing temperatures, even at high latitudes during periods of greenhouse climates. To fully understand the paleoenvironmental significance of glendonites, a comprehensive examination of the modern ikaite setting is necessary. Temperature is the most important parameter that has been quantitatively constrained for the presence of ikaite. Low bottom-water temperature, while a required condition for formation of the mineral, is not adequate for its growth; other controls are necessary to explain the absence of ikaite in many cold environments. In this study, we discuss the control of carbonate chemistry on ikaite formation. Our compilation of geochemical data from sediment cores with well-preserved ikaite provide further evidence for the importance of phosphate. A phosphate concentration above ∼400 $\mu$M in shallow and cold porewater may be the requisite parameter for extensive ikaite precipitation. Thus, abundant glendonites in ancient successions mark past periods and regions of elevated porewater phosphorus concentrations, which may also be related to high surface productivity and/or iron fertilization.},

Across each of the boundaries, biodiversity declined sharply in fusulinid, rugose coral, brachiopod, ammonite, conodont, and radiolaria. Both boundaries are characterized by two biohorizons, i.e., one marked by major extinction of preexisting fauna and the other by the first appearance of younger fauna. It is noteworthy that a peculiar rhyo-dacitic tuff bed occurs at each of the extinction horizons. Thus the Late Permian biosphere was strongly affected twice by highly explosive, severe volcanism. Regional correlation of the G-L and P-T boundary tuff beds throughout South China, and partly to Japan, positively suggests a cause-effect link between large-scale explosive volcanism and mass extinction.},

abstract = {One of the most enigmatic features of Cenozoic long-term climate evolution is the long-lasting positive carbon-isotope excursion or "Monterey Excursion", which started during a period of global warmth after 16.9 Ma and ended at ∼ 13.5 Ma, approximately 400 kyr after major expansion of the Antarctic ice-sheet. We present high-resolution (1-9 kyr) astronomically-tuned climate proxy records in two complete sedimentary successions from the northwestern and southeastern Pacific (ODP Sites 1146 and 1237), which shed new light on the middle Miocene carbon-isotope excursion and associated climatic transition over the interval 17.1-12.7 Ma. We recognize three distinct climate phases with different imprints of orbital variations into the climatic signals (1146 and 1237 $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C; 1237 XRF Fe, fraction {\textgreater} 63 $\mu$m): (1) climate optimum prior to 14.7 Ma characterized by minimum ice volume and prominent 100 and 400 kyr variability, (2) long-term cooling from 14.7 to 13.9 Ma, principally driven by obliquity and culminating with rapid cryosphere expansion and global cooling at the onset of the last and most pronounced $\delta$13C increase, (3) "Icehouse" mode after 13.9 Ma with distinct 100 kyr variability and improved ventilation of the deep Pacific. The "Monterey" carbon-isotope excursion (16.9-13.5 Ma) consists overall of nine 400 kyr cycles, which show high coherence with the long eccentricity period. Superposed on these low-frequency oscillations are high-frequency variations (100 kyr), which closely track the amplitude modulation of the short eccentricity period. In contrast to $\delta$13C, the $\delta$18O signal additionally shows significant power in the 41 kyr band, and the 1.2 Myr amplitude modulation of the obliquity cycle is clearly imprinted in the 1146 $\delta$18O signal. Our results suggest that eccentricity was a prime pacemaker of middle Miocene climate evolution through the modulation of long-term carbon budgets and that obliquity-paced changes in high-latitude seasonality favored the transition into the "Icehouse" climate. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Conchostracans or clam shrimp (order Conchostraca Sars) are arthropods with a carapace consisting of two chitinous lateral valves. Triassic conchostracans range in size from 2 to 12.5 mm long and are common in deposits that formed in fresh water lakes, isolated ponds and brackish areas. Their dessication- and freeze-resistant eggs can be dispersed by wind over long distances. Therefore many conchostracan species are distributed throughout the entire northern hemisphere. In the Late Permian to Middle Triassic interval, several of these forms are also found in Gondwana. Many wide-ranging conchostracan species have short stratigraphic ranges, making them excellent guide forms for subdivision of Triassic time and for long-range correlations. The stratigraphic resolution that can be achieved with conchostracan zones is often as high as for ammonoid and conodont zones found in pelagic marine deposits. This makes conchostracans the most useful group available for biostratigraphic subdivision and correlation in continental lake deposits. Upper Triassic Gondwanan conchostracan faunas are different from conchostracan faunas of the northern hemisphere. In the Norian, some slight provincialism can be observed even within the northern hemisphere. For example, the Sevatian Redondestheria seems to be restricted to North America and Acadiestheriella n. gen. so far has been found only in the Sevatian deposits from the Fundy Basin of southeastern Canada. Here we establish a conchostracan zonation for the Changhsingian (Late Permian) to Hettangian (Early Jurassic) of the northern hemisphere that, for the most part, is very well correlated with the marine scale. This zonation is especially robust for the Changhsingian to early Anisian, late Ladinian to Cordevolian and Rhaetian to Hettangian intervals. For most of the Middle and Upper Triassic, this zonation is still preliminary. Five new genera, six new species and a new subspecies of conchostracans are described that are stratigraphically important.},

abstract = {A combined field/laboratory study has been undertaken to explore the mineralogy, concentrations and reactivity (towards sulfide) of iron in marine sediments. Also considered is the importance of bacterial Fe liberation in regulating pore-water chemistry. Two contrasting marine environments are included; one is the relatively Fe-poor FOAM site and the other is the Fe-rich sediment of the subaqueous Mississippi Delta. Results show that oxide minerals are the most important Fe phases in early diagenetic pyrite formation. However, viewed separately, lepidocrocite and ferrihydrite are more reactive towards sulfide than goethite and hematite. When Fe oxides are present in relatively high concentrations, dissolved sulfide is nearly absent from sediment pore waters (with concomitant high concentrations of dissolved Fe), even in the presence of active sulfide production by sulfate reduction. A combination of experimental results and diagenetic modelling shows that in some sediments pore water Fe finds it origin in the bacterial reduction of iron oxides. This seems the case even though greater amounts of Fe are reduced by reaction of sulfide with iron oxides. It appears that distinct microenvironments may exist in marine sediments, where, in one microenvironment, sulfide reacts with Fe oxides locally precipitating Fe sulfide minerals. In another, Fe reduced and solubilized by microorganisms migrates freely into solution. ?? 1989.},

abstract = {The Coorong Region of South Australia is a classic location for the study of modern dolomite formation. A number of ephemeral lakes here contain dolomite, whilst other lakes in close proximity, contain aragonite with minor magnesite. Our previous field and experimental work has revealed that sulphate-reducing bacteria play a key role in overcoming kinetic inhibitors to dolomite formation in this area. We here use a combination of oxygen, carbon and sulphur isotopes to help to further constrain the processes leading to dolomite precipitation in modern hypersaline environments. We report isotopic data from four dolomite and three aragonite containing lakes. ??34S data for dissolved lake- and porewater sulphates reveal 34S enrichment of residual sulphate in all seven lakes, consistent with bulk closed system microbial fractionation by sulphate-reducing bacteria. Calculations using temperature-dependent oxygen isotope fractionation factors between dolomite and the solution from which it precipitated are consistent with a strong microbial component to carbonate precipitation in these lakes. A comparison of ??18O data from dolomite and aragonite sediment and from their associated lakewaters indicates seasonal mineral precipitation occurs late in the evaporative cycle of the lakes within a yoghurt-like saturated mud horizon coincident with the zone of sulphate reduction. Surprisingly, ??13C data from the carbonates do not show the characteristic wide range of values often associated with 'organogenic' carbonates, but instead show that these bacterially-mediated precipitates incorporate carbon primarily from the inorganic, lakewater reservoir, partially diluted by an organic component. A 'Coorong type' microbial model of dolomite formation may be particularly applicable to, for example, Precambrian sedimentary dolomites where benthic microbial communities, which are today restricted to extreme environments, dominated the shallow-marine ecosystem prior to the emergence of Metazoa. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The modern Mediterranean Sea is oligotrophic, yet its sediment record contains layers of organic-carbon-rich sapropels at 21 ky (precessional) spacing that imply periods of elevated paleoproductivity that approached the high productivities of modern upwelling systems. Resolution to this paradox is provided by lines of evidence suggesting that the mode of primary productivity changed from one dominated by algae to one during times of sapropel deposition in which photosynthetic bacteria were important. We have made a high-resolution comparison of the organic carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of three sapropels and their background sediments in a 3-m sequence that corresponds to 1001 to 946 ka. Organic $\delta$13C values systematically increase from - 26‰ to - 21‰ and $\delta$15N values systematically decrease from ∼4‰ to {\textless} 0‰ as organic carbon mass accumulation rates increase in the sapropel layers. The increase in carbon isotope values mirrors the increases in primary productivity and associated organic matter export indicated by the increased mass accumulation rates. The decrease in nitrogen isotope values implies major contributions of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria to the total marine productivity. The precessional minima with which sapropels coincide were times of wetter climate that stratified the surface Mediterranean Sea, increased delivery of soil-derived phosphorus, and evidently amplified microbial primary production. Our high-resolution study reveals several relatively rapid excursions into and out of the high-productivity mode that suggest that sapropel deposition was a climate-sensitive surface-driven phenomenon that was not accompanied by basin-wide stagnation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ni2+ affinity columns are widely used for protein purification, but they carry the risk that Ni2+ ions may bind to the protein, either adventitiously or at a physiologically important site. Dialysis against ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is normally used to remove metal ions bound adventitiously to proteins; however, this approach does not always work. Here we report that a bacterial endonuclease, the DNase domain of colicin E9, binds Ni2+ acquired from Ni2+ affinity columns, and appears to bind [Ni(EDTA)(H2O)n]2- at low ionic strength. NMR was used to detect the presence of both Ni2+ coordinated to amino acid side chains and [Ni(EDTA)(H2O)N]2-. Dialysis against {\textgreater} or =0.2 M NaCl was required to remove the [Ni(EDTA)(H2O)n]2-. The NMR procedure we have used to characterize the presence of Ni2+ and [Ni(EDTA)(H2O)n]2- should be applicable to other proteins where there is the possibility of binding paramagnetic metal ions that are present to expedite protein purification. In the present case, the binding of Ni2+ seems likely to be physiologically relevant, and the NMR data complement recent X-ray crystallographic evidence concerning the number of histidine ligands to bound Ni2+.},

abstract = {The transition from the Triassic to Jurassic Period, initiating the 'Age of the dinosaurs', approximately 200 Ma, is marked by a profound mass extinction with more than 50{\%} genus loss in both marine and continental realms. This event closely coincides with a period of extensive volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) associated with the initial break-up of Pangaea but a causal relationship is still debated. The Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary is recently proposed in the marine record at the first occurrence datum of Jurassic ammonites, post-dating the extinction interval that concurs with two distinct perturbations in the carbon isotope record. The continental record shows a major palynological turnover together with a prominent change in tetrapod taxa, but a direct link to the marine events is still equivocal. Here we develop an accurate chronostratigraphic framework for the T-J boundary interval and establish detailed trans-Atlantic and marine-continental correlations by integrating astrochronology, paleomagnetism, basalt geochemistry and geobiology. We show that the oldest CAMP basalts are diachronous by 20 kyr across the Atlantic Ocean, and that these two volcanic pulses coincide with the end-Triassic extinction interval in the marine realm. Our results support the hypotheses of Phanerozoic mass extinctions resulting from emplacement of Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) and provide crucial time constraints for numerical modelling of Triassic-Jurassic climate change and global carbon-cycle perturbations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Global plate motion models provide a spatial and temporal framework for geological data and have been effective tools for exploring processes occurring at the earth's surface. However, published models either have insufficient temporal coverage or fail to treat tectonic plates in a self-consistent manner. They usually consider the motions of selected features attached to tectonic plates, such as continents, but generally do not explicitly account for the continuous evolution of plate boundaries through time. In order to explore the coupling between the surface and mantle, plate models are required that extend over at least a few hundred million years and treat plates as dynamic features with dynamically evolving plate boundaries. We have constructed a new type of global plate motion model consisting of a set of continuously-closing topological plate polygons with associated plate boundaries and plate velocities since the break-up of the supercontinent Pangea. Our model is underpinned by plate motions derived from reconstructing the seafloor-spreading history of the ocean basins and motions of the continents and utilizes a hybrid absolute reference frame, based on a moving hotspot model for the last 100. Ma, and a true-polar wander corrected paleomagnetic model for 200 to 100. Ma. Detailed regional geological and geophysical observations constrain plate boundary inception or cessation, and time-dependent geometry. Although our plate model is primarily designed as a reference model for a new generation of geodynamic studies by providing the surface boundary conditions for the deep earth, it is also useful for studies in disparate fields when a framework is needed for analyzing and interpreting spatio-temporal data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We argue that the paleontological data suggest two pulses of extinction – one at the White Sea–Nama transition, which ushers in a recognizably metazoan fauna (the ‘Wormworld'), and a second pulse at the E–C boundary itself. We argue that this latest Ediacaran fauna has more in common with the Cambrian than the earlier Ediacaran, and thus may represent the earliest phase of the Cambrian Explosion.},

abstract = {Geographic range is of crucial importance concerning the extinction risk of species. However, our understanding of how the influence of this trait on extinction risk has varied through Earth history and across different climate regimes is still rather unexplored. This is especially true for taxa that are currently of strong interest in conservation biology, displaying a strong mismatch between paleontological studies and modern efforts to quantify the extinction risk of threatened species. We herein calculated a continuous measure for the connection of geographic range and extinction risk in the deep-time amphibian fossil record. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of climate on this connection, using two climate proxies derived from oxygen isotope data (global relative temperature change and variations in the latitudinal temperature gradient). We show that geographic ranges tended to be larger during times of comparatively small latitudinal temperature gradients. Moreover, the strength of geographic range influencing extinction risk fluctuated temporally, but remained positive at all times. The variation in range size impact on extinction risk showed a strong connection with the latitudinal temperature gradient. Our findings indicate that geographic range persists as a factor influencing species' extinction risk through all times. However, geographic range seemed less important during times of higher environmental variability. Reasons might be the restriction of species ranges due to environmental constraints, causing ranges to become more similar and therefore lose relative importance in buffering for extinction risk, while other factors gain in importance. Simultaneously, similar ranges might be more prone to alteration by e.g. conservation biases (related to sedimentary deposition and fossilization) in relation to their real range size, resulting in a smaller signal-to-noise ratio, potentially affecting the correlation strength. We show that trait-extinction risk dynamics can vary in their intensity, and that specifically the observed impact of geographic range on extinction risk can vary with climatic changes.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Life on Earth underwent a protracted recovery following the Permian–Triassic mass extinction. The slowness of the recovery process may have been caused, in part, by episodic environmental and climatic crises during the Early Triassic, among which the Smithian–Spathian boundary (SSB) event is conspicuous. Here, we investigate the SSB event in the Shitouzhai section, South China, using a combination of carbonate carbon ($\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C{\textless}sub{\textgreater}carb{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}) and carbonate-associated sulfate sulfur isotopes ({\&}delta;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S{\textless}sub{\textgreater}CAS{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), rare earth elements, and elemental palaeoredox and palaeoproductivity proxies.

This relationship may reflect an increase in organic carbon burial (e.g., due to elevated marine productivity) concurrently with oxidation of isotopically light H{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}S, a pattern that we attribute to enhanced vertical advection of nutrient- and sulfide-rich deepwaters to the ocean-surface layer. Enhanced upwelling was a likely response to the well-documented climatic cooling event at the SSB that terminated the extreme hothouse conditions of the Griesbachian–Smithian, a cooling that we infer to have transiently invigorated the global-ocean overturning circulation. Evidence at Shitouzhai for concurrent decreases in chemical weathering intensity and detrital sediment influx are also consistent with climatic cooling. A penecontemporaneous decline in marine biodiversity was probably associated with the late Smithian thermal maximum rather than the SSB event itself, and the affected marine faunas did not recover immediately in response to climatic and environmental amelioration at the SSB but, rather, underwent a stepwise recovery during the early to middle Spathian. The ultimate cause of the SSB event is uncertain but may have been related to reduced intrusive magmatic activity in the Siberian Traps Large Igneous Province.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Carbon-isotope stratigraphy is a useful tool for stratigraphic correlation, especially for strata deposited during major perturbations of the carbon cycle that affected the marine, terrestrial and atmospheric reservoirs. For the Triassic–Jurassic boundary, effectively defined by a first-order mass extinction, major fluctuations in carbon-isotope values have been well documented, but these datasets have generally been derived from bulk-rock samples. Hence, the extent to which features of the isotopic curve reflect diagenetic alteration or changing proportions of constituent materials is unconstrained. Here, carbon-and oxygen-isotope data are presented from well-preserved oyster shells (Liostrea) comprising low-magnesium calcite, a mineral species relatively resistant to diagenetic alteration. Samples were obtained from Lavernock Point, Glamorgan, Wales, a coastal section close to a candidate stratotype for the base of the Jurassic at St Audrie's Bay, Somerset, England. The carbon-isotope signature from St Audrie's Bay, previously defined on the basis of analysis of bulk organic matter, is confirmed by our new data. Major features are (1) the upper part of an 'initial' negative isotope excursion in the lowest part of the section, followed by (2) a pronounced positive excursion, and (3) an extended 'main' negative isotope excursion in the highest part of the section. The data confirm that the carbon-isotope stratigraphy previously documented from bulk organic matter in SW England records the chemical composition of the contemporaneous seawater. Bulk carbonates sampled over the same interval near Lyme Regis, England, show similar trends to those from oyster calcite in the lower part of the study section, but there are more 13 C-depleted values up-section. These lower values probably result from an admixture of primary and diagenetic carbonate. Palaeotemperatures calculated from oxygen-isotope values from Lavernock Point oyster shells are relatively cool at the beginning of the positive carbon-isotope excursion, and increased by up to 10 8C during the main negative carbon-isotope excursion. The new results are compatible with the view that positive carbon-isotope excursions correspond to times of low atmospheric carbon dioxide content, whereas negative carbon-isotope excursions correspond to times of high atmospheric carbon dioxide content, as is also found to be the case during the Early Jurassic (Toarcian) Oceanic Anoxic Event. The Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca ratios and {\"{a}} 18 O of investigated Liostrea hisingeri show no correlation, supporting data from modern bivalves that indicate that incorporation of Mg and Sr is controlled mainly by factors other than temperature.},

Sediment samples from this low-pH system indicate that carbonates are formed in physico-chemical conditions ranging from acid to neutral pH. Evidence for microbial mediation is observed in secondary electron images (Fig. 1), which reveal rod-shaped bacteria embedded in the surface of siderite nanocrystals. The formation of carbonates in Rio Tinto is related to the microbial reduction of ferric iron coupled to the oxidation of organic compounds. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time, that Acidiphilium sp. PM, an iron-reducing bacterium isolated from Rio Tinto, mediates the precipitation of siderite (FeCO3) under acidic conditions and at a low temperature (30°C).

Impor-tantly, these events allow us the opportunity to study ecologi-cal dynamics under levels of environmental stress for whichthere are no recent analogues. Here, we examine the impactand selectivity of the Late Triassic mass extinction event onthe functional diversity and functional composition of the glo-bal marine ecosystem, and test whether post-extinction com-munities in the Early Jurassic represent a regime shift awayfrom pre-extinction communities in the Late Triassic. Ouranalyses show that, despite severe taxonomic losses, there is nounequivocal loss of global functional diversity associated withthe extinction. Even though no functional groups were lost,the extinction event was, however, highly selective againstsome modes of life, in particular sessile suspension feeders.Although taxa with heavily calcified skeletons suffered higherextinction than other taxa, lightly calcified taxa also appear tohave been selected against. The extinction appears to haveinvigorated the already ongoing faunal turnover associatedwith the Mesozoic Marine Revolution. The ecological effectsof the Late Triassic mass extinction were preferentially felt inthe tropical latitudes, especially amongst reefs, and it tookuntil the Middle Jurassic for reef ecosystems to fully recover topre-extinction levels.},

abstract = {Chemical reactions in marine sediments and the resulting fluxes across the sediment-water interface influence the global carbon cycle and the pH of the sea and affect the abundance of CaCO3 and opal-forming plankton in the ocean. On very long timescales these diagenetic reactions control carbon burial in sedimentary rocks and the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Sedimentary deposits that remain after diagenesis are the geochemical artifacts used for interpreting past changes in ocean circulation, biogeochemical cycles, and climate. This chapter is about the processes of diagenesis and burial of the chemical elements that make up the bulk of the particulate matter that reaches the seafloor (organic matter, CaCO3, SiO2, Fe, Mn, and aluminosilicates).Understanding of sediment diagenesis and benthic fluxes has evolved with advances in both experimental methods and modeling. Measurements of chemical concentrations in sediments, their associated pore waters and fluxes at the sediment-water interface have been used to identify the most important reactions. Because transport in pore waters is usually by molecular diffusion, this medium is conducive to interpretation by models of heterogeneous chemical equilibrium and kinetics. Large chemical changes and manageable transport mechanisms have led to elegant models of sediment diagenesis and great advances in understanding of diagenetic processes.We shall see, though, that the environment does not yield totally to simple models of chemical equilibrium and chemical kinetics, and laboratory determined constants often cannot explain the field observations. For example, organic matter degradation rate constants determined from modeling are so variable that there are essentially no constraints on these values from laboratory experiments. In addition, reaction rates of CaCO3 and opal dissolution determined from modeling pore waters usually cannot be reproduced in laboratory experiments of these reactions. The inability to mechanistically understand reaction kinetics calculated from diagenesis models is an important uncertainty in the field today.Processes believed to be most important in controlling the preservation of organic matter have evolved from a focus on the lability of the substrate to the protective mechanisms of mineral-organic matter interactions. The specific electron acceptor is not particularly important during very early diagenesis, but the importance of oxygen to the degradation of organic matter during later stages of diagenesis has been clarified by the study of diagenesis in turbidites deposited on the ocean floor during glacial periods.Evolution of thinking about the importance of reactions between seawater and detrital clay minerals has come full circle since the mid-1960s. "Reverse weathering" reactions were hypothesized in very early chemical equilibrium (Sillen, 1961) and mass-balance ( Mackenzie and Garrels, 1966) models of the oceans. Subsequent observations that marine clay minerals generally resemble those weathered from adjacent land and the discovery of hydrothermal circulation put these ideas on the back burner. Recent studies of silicate and aluminum diagenesis, however, have rekindled awareness of this process, and it is back in the minds of geochemists as a potentially important process for closing the marine mass balance of some elements.},

However, the mechanisms governing transition between so-called Warm Modes and Cool Modes are poorly known. Here we present a new large high-quality oxygen-isotope dataset from an interval that includes previously suggested mode transitions. Our results show an especially abrupt earliest Middle Jurassic ( 1/4174 Ma) mid-latitude cooling of seawater by as much as 10 °C in the north-south Laurasian Seaway, a marine passage that connected the equatorial Tethys Ocean to the Boreal Sea. Coincidence in timing with large-scale regional lithospheric updoming of the North Sea region is striking, and we hypothesize that northward oceanic heat transport was impeded by uplift, triggering Cool Mode conditions more widely. This extreme climate-mode transition provides a counter-example to other Mesozoic transitions linked to quantitative change in atmospheric greenhouse gas content.},

abstract = {In the Wadi Wasit area (Central Oman Mountains), Dienerian breccias are widespread. These breccias consist mostly of Guadalupian reefal blocks, often dolomitised, and some rare small-sized blocks of lowermost Triassic bivalve-bearing limestones, A unique block, with a size of about 200 m3, including Permian and earliest Triassic faunas has been studied in detail. The so-called Wadi Wasit block consists of three major lithological units. A basal unstratified grey limestone is rich in various reef-building organisms (rugose corals, calcareous sponges, stromatoporoids) and has been dated as Middle Permian. It is disconformably overlain by well- and thin-bedded light grey to yellowish coloured limestones rich in molluscs. Two major lithologies (Coquina Limestone respectively Bioclastic Limestone unit) characterise the shelly limestones, their contact seems gradual. These two units are well-dated; they are of Griesbachian age and contain three conodont zones, the Parvus Zone, the Staeschei Zone and the Sosioensis Zone, and two ammonoid zones, the Ophiceras tibeticum Zone and an 'unnamed interval'. The third unit consists of a grey marly limestone containing Neospathodus kummeli (basal Dienerian). It is the first record of well-dated basal Triassic sediments in the Arabian Peninsula. The Coquina Limestone is dominated by the bivalve Promyalina with some Claraia and Eumorphotis. This bivalve association is interpreted as a pioneering opportunistic assemblage. Towards the top of the Bioclastic Limestone unit, the faunal diversity increases and contains probably more than 20 taxa of bivalves, microgastropods, crinoids, brachiopods, ammonoids, echinoid spines, ostracods and conodonts. The generic diversity of this biofacies exceeds by far any other Griesbachian assemblage known. Our data give new evidence for the geodynamical history for the distal carbonate shelf bordering the Hawasina Basin. A break in the sedimentation characterises the Late Permian. The basal Triassic shows a steady transgression and the breccias may record a distinct gravitational collapse of platform margins linked with sea-level low stand at the end of Induan time (late Dienerian-basal Smithian). ??13Ccarb isotopic analyses were performed and yield typical Permian values of around 4??? for the Reefal Limestone, with a strong negative shift across the Permian-Triassic boundary. During the Griesbachian values shift positively from 0.5 to 3.1??? parallel to an increase in faunal diversity and probably primary productivity. The detailed faunal analysis and the discovery of an unexpected diversity give us a new understanding of the recovery of the Early Triassic marine ecosystem. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {One of the great debates about extinction is whether humans or climatic change caused the demise of the Pleistocene megafauna. Evidence from paleontology, climatology, archaeology, and ecology now supports the idea that humans contributed to extinction on some continents, but human hunting was not solely responsible for the pattern of extinction everywhere. Instead, evidence suggests that the intersection of human impacts with pronounced climatic change drove the precise timing and geography of extinction in the Northern Hemisphere. The story from the Southern Hemisphere is still unfolding. New evidence from Australia supports the view that humans helped cause extinctions there, but the correlation with climate is weak or contested. Firmer chronologies, more realistic ecological models, and regional paleoecological insights still are needed to understand details of the worldwide extinction pattern and the population dynamics of the species involved.},

abstract = {The Early Cretaceous carbonate carbon isotope record is marked by three positive high-amplitude ({\textgreater} 1.5‰) excursions each covering time spans of more than 106 years. They are of late Valanginian-Hauterivian and early and late Aptian age. In a case study along a transect across the western Tethys Ocean we identified a coincidence between $\delta$13C excursions, black shale formation, and widespread carbonate platform drowning events. We conclude that the $\delta$13C excursions reflect a change in partitioning of carbon between the organic and carbonate carbon sinks which was triggered by climate induced ecological changes in Cretaceous pelagic and neritic environments. Episodes of intensified greenhouse climate conditions led to an increase in weathering, erosion and runoff rates and to elevated nutrient transfer rates from continents into oceans. The resulting increase in oceanic nutrient levels favoured marine phytoplankton production and black shale deposition while conditions for carbonate producing biotas became unfavourable. Partial choking of carbonate production along river influenced coasts resulted in widespread carbonate platform drowning during times of sea-level rise in the Valanginian and Aptian. Widespread contemporaneous black shale deposits and drowned carbonate platforms therefore reflect the contrasting response of the marine organic and carbonate carbon pumps to nutrient-enhanced phytoplankton productivity. The change in marine carbon partitioning is mirrored in a shift of the $\delta$13C record towards more positive values. The transition to the $\delta$13C peak values lasted up to several hundred thousand years. The peaks of the excursions, also covering a time span of up to several hundred thousand years, reflect a new stabilisation of the carbon partitioning between carbonate and organic carbon sinks. A renewed intensification of carbonate sedimentation under mesotrophic conditions was facilitated by stabilisation of the sea-level rise at a high level. Decreasing $\delta$13C values record increasing carbonate carbon burial rates at constant or decreasing organic carbon accumulation rates. These changes contributed to the stabilisation of the marine carbon budget and the global carbon cycle up to millions of years after its initial perturbation.},

abstract = {Brachiopod miniaturization is both the reduction in size of individuals of a species over time, and where one brachiopod fauna dominated by larger individuals was replaced by a brachiopod fauna dominated by smaller individuals over time. This paper investigates this phenomenon prior to and during the end-Permian crisis in a deep water setting in South China, based on precise measurements of brachiopod body size and on the abundance and diversity of brachiopod species. The process of miniaturization near the Permian-Triassic boundary in deep water environments is characterized by: (1) Larger species, including Martinia sp., Costatumulus dongpanensis, and Anidanthus mucronata, reduced in average body size and abundance over time towards the end-Permian brachiopod extinction event. (2) Small species, including Attenuatella mengi and Spinomarginifera semicircridge, showed a mixed response with either no size change, or a reduction in average body size, while these species increased in abundance over time, indicating they were less sensitive to the stressed environmental setting. (3) Both the total abundance and the diversity of this brachiopod fauna decreased over time towards the end-Permian crisis. Regression, an increased input of terrestrial material and productivity decline are considered to all have contributed to brachiopod miniaturization, based on the biotic replacement and changes in sea-water chemistry. Among these factors, the fall in sea level is perhaps the primary factor, and led to a decline in productivity and an increased input of terrestrial material into the marine setting. 2007.},

The SIMS data show both systematic variations with time and rando m Poisson variability, but the former largely cancel out when data for two different isotopes are expressed as a ratio. The precision of a SIMS isotope ratio routinely matches that predicted by Poisson counting statistics and can approach that of conventional bulk analysis techniques for counting times of several hours. All sample analyse must be calibrated for instrumental mass fractionation using SIMS analyses of a standard material. There is often a gradual drift in the mass fractionation with time, but this can be modelled by least-squares regression of the standard isotope ratios. Drift in the sample analyses is eliminated by using the relevant point on this regression line to calibrate each sample. The final precision of a corrected isotope ratio must take into account the scatter in both the sample and the standard data.},

abstract = {Widespread development of microbialites characterizes the substrate and ecological response during the aftermath of two of the 'big five' mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. This study reviews the microbial response recorded by macroscopic microbial structures to these events to examine how extinction mechanism may be linked to the style of microbialite development. Two main styles of response are recognized: (i) the expansion of microbialites into environments not previously occupied during the pre-extinction interval and (ii) increases in microbialite abundance and attainment of ecological dominance within environments occupied prior to the extinction. The Late Devonian biotic crisis contributed toward the decimation of platform margin reef taxa and was followed by increases in microbialite abundance in Famennian and earliest Carboniferous platform interior, margin, and slope settings. The end-Permian event records the suppression of infaunal activity and an elimination of metazoan-dominated reefs. The aftermath of this mass extinction is characterized by the expansion of microbialites into new environments including offshore and nearshore ramp, platform interior, and slope settings. The mass extinctions at the end of the Triassic and Cretaceous have not yet been associated with a macroscopic microbial response, although one has been suggested for the end-Ordovician event. The case for microbialites behaving as 'disaster forms' in the aftermath of mass extinctions accurately describes the response following the Late Devonian and end-Permian events, and this may be because each is marked by the reduction of reef communities in addition to a suppression of bioturbation related to the development of shallow-water anoxia.},

abstract = {Several new discoveries suggest that the climate of the Cretaceous may have been more different from that of today than has been previously supposed. Detailed maps of climate-sensitive fossils and sediments compiled by Nicolai Chumakov and his colleagues in Russia indicate widespread aridity in the equatorial region during the Early Cretaceous. The very warm ocean temperatures postulated for the Mid-Cretaceous by some authors would likely have resulted in unacceptable heat stress for land plants at those latitudes, however, and may be flawed.Seasonal reversals of the atmospheric pressure systems in the Polar Regions are an oversimplification. However, the seasonal pressure differences between 30° and 60° latitude became quite pronounced, being more than 25hPa in winter and less than 10hPa in summer. This resulted in inconstant winds, affecting the development of the gyre-limiting frontal systems that control modern ocean circulation. The idea of Hasegawa et al. (2012) who suggest a drastic reduction in the size of the Hadley cells during the warm Cretaceous greenhouse is supported by several numerical climate simulations. Rapid contraction of the Hadley cell such that its sinking dry air occurs at 15° N latitude rather than 30° N is proposed to occur at a threshold of 1000ppmv CO2 in the atmosphere. This change will probably be reached in the next century. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aggregates of authigenic pyrite and gypsum were found at site HS373 in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Most of the pyrite occurs as tubes consisting of framboids. Gypsum aggregates are mainly represented by rosettes and some of them grew over pyrite, revealing that gypsum precipitation postdated pyrite formation. At seeps, extensive sulfate-driven anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) commonly leads to the accumulation of 34S enriched sulfide, resulting in the formation of 32S depleted pyrite. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyrite at site HS373 reveals a great variability of 75.5??? in ??34S values, spanning from -37.6??? to 37.9??? (V-CDT) with a distinct trend towards higher values with increasing depth. This trend indicates an increase of the effect of sulfate-driven AOM with depth, whereas pyrite at shallow depth apparently resulted mostly from organiclastic sulfate reduction. To date, reports on coexisting pyrite and gypsum in seep environments are limited, and therefore the mechanism of gypsum formation is insufficiently understood. This is the first time that the sulfur and oxygen stable isotope composition of gypsum has been analyzed to understand its formation at seeps. The ??34S values of gypsum vary from -24.5??? to 0.9???, revealing a similar trend with depth like pyrite. The ??18Ogypsum values range from 5.3??? to 12.3??? (V-SMOW), with a scattered trend to lower values with depth. The combined evidence reveals that gypsum formation was linked to the establishment of more oxidizing conditions, probably caused by waning seepage. This led to the oxidation of pyrite and the associated increase in pore water sulfate and acidity, which favored carbonate mineral dissolution, providing the calcium ions required for gypsum formation. The observed isotopic variability of gypsum suggests that oxidation occurred by different mechanisms at different depth, whereby pyrite oxidation was dominated by aerobic processes at shallow depth involving dissolved molecular oxygen, and by anaerobic processes at greater depth involving electron acceptors like ferric iron. Taken together, the stable isotope compositions of pyrite and gypsum suggest that the redox conditions within the studied sediments were variable. Such variability was controlled by complex factors, among which changes in seepage activity have been instrumental for the vertical displacement of the sulfate methane transition zone.},

abstract = {The coastal upwelling system off central Namibia is one of the most productive regions of the oceans and is characterized by frequently occurring shelf anoxia with severe effects for the benthic life and fisheries. We present data on water column dissolved oxygen, sulfide, nitrate and nitrite, pore water profiles for dissolved sulfide and sulfate, 
                        35S-sulfate reduction rates, as well as bacterial counts of large sulfur bacteria from 20 stations across the continental shelf and slope. The stations covered two transects and included the inner shelf with its anoxic and extremely oxygen-depleted bottom waters, the oxygen minimum zone on the continental slope, and the lower continental slope below the oxygen minimum zone. High concentrations of dissolved sulfide, up to 22 mM, in the near-surface sediments of the inner shelf result from extremely high rates of bacterial sulfate reduction and the low capacity to oxidize and trap sulfide. The inner shelf break marks the seaward border of sulfidic bottom waters, and separates two different regimes of bacterial sulfate reduction. In the sulfidic bottom waters on the shelf, up to 55{\%} of sulfide oxidation is mediated by the large nitrate-storing sulfur bacteria, Thiomargarita spp. The filamentous relatives Beggiatoa spp. occupy low-O
                        2 bottom waters on the outer shelf. Sulfide oxidation on the slope is apparently not mediated by the large sulfur bacteria. The data demonstrate the importance of large sulfur bacteria, which live close to the sediment-water interface and reduce the hydrogen sulfide flux to the water column. Modeling of pore water sulfide concentration profiles indicates that sulfide produced by bacterial sulfate reduction in the uppermost 16 cm of sediment is sufficient to account for the total flux of hydrogen sulfide to the water column. However, the total pool of hydrogen sulfide in the water column is too large to be explained by steady state diffusion across the sediment-water interface. Episodic advection of hydrogen sulfide, possibly triggered by methane eruptions, may contribute to hydrogen sulfide in the water column. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Triassic-Jurassic transition is characterized by a major extinction in the marine realm but evidence for floral turnover is ambiguous. Here we present the results of a detailed palynological and carbon isotope ($\delta$13Corg) study across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary from the Hochalplgraben section, with first data from the Kuhjoch section. Both sections are located in the Eiberg Basin (Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria) and they contain well-preserved palynomorphs and ammonites which allow an integration of terrestrial microfloral events in a marine biostratigraphic framework. Five palynomorph assemblages are recognized in the Hochalplgraben section. The initial $\delta$13Corg shift occurs at the base of the Tiefengraben Member, the lower part of the Kendlbach Formation, and coincides with an acme of prasinophytes, mainly Cymatiosphaera polypartita. Typical Late Triassic pollen taxa (e.g. Lunatisporites rhaeticus, Rhaetipollis germanicus and Ovalipollis pseudoalatus) disappear at the top of the Schattwald beds (Tiefengraben Member). The first occurrence of the ammonite Psiloceras spelae n. ssp., which is proposed as a marker for the base of the Jurassic System, occurs in the Trachysporites-Heliosporites palynomorph assemblage zone. The base of this zone is marked by the first occurrence of Cerebropollenites thiergartii. Our results show that palynological and $\delta$13Corg records from different sections within the Eiberg Basin correlate well and that the established palynostratigraphic scheme allows for very detailed local and regional correlations (e.g. with Danish, German and English basins). {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Rapid 3-D emission of pseudopodia from interlocular spaces on both umbilical and spiral sides of adult A. beccarii s.s. can support its test within the seaweed framework. This behaviour is characteristic of phytal species. Thus, it appears that the major difference between A. beccarii s.s. and A. tepida is the presence of large interlocular spaces on spiral side of the former, corresponding to a potential morphofunctional adaptation to the epiphytic mode of life. We believe that these observations could help to solve the long-lasting A. beccarii problems of specific distinction.},

Xiakou, a carbonate ramp section, exhibits $\delta$13Ccarb excursions of up to –2‰, and Xinmin, a deep-shelf section, exhibits $\delta$13Corg excursions of up to –6‰. In both sections, these excursions are associated with volcanic ash layers, and excursion size scales with ash layer thickness. These relationships document the direct influence of volcanism on the Earth-surface carbon cycle during the PTB crisis. Previous studies of ash layers in south China PTB sections have invoked a source in regional subduction-zone volcanism in the eastern Tethys, but our analysis suggests that these ash layers may represent distal deposits from large-scale explosive eruptions of the Siberian Traps. If confirmed by further investigation, this hypothesis would have important implications both for kill mechanisms during the PTB crisis as well as for refinement of the eruption history of the Siberian Traps.},

abstract = {The carbon isotopic (delta(13)C) composition of bulk carbonate sediments deposited off the margins of four carbonate platforms/ramp systems (Bahamas, Maldives, Queensland Plateau, and Great Australian Bight) show synchronous changes over the past 0 to 10 million years. However, these variations are different from the established global pattern in the delta(13)C measured in the open oceans over the same time period. For example, from 10 Ma to the present, the delta(13)C of open oceanic carbonate has decreased, whereas platform margin sediments analyzed here show an increase. It is suggested that the delta(13)C patterns in the marginal platform deposits are produced through admixing of aragonite-rich sediments, which have relatively positive delta(13)C values, with pelagic materials, which have lower delta(13)C values. As the more isotopically positive shallow-water carbonate sediments are only produced when the platforms are flooded, there is a connection between changes in global sea level and the delta(13)C of sediments in marginal settings. These data indicate that globally synchronous changes in delta(13)C can take place that are completely unrelated to variations in the global carbon cycle. Fluctuations in the delta(13)C of carbonate sediments measured during previous geological periods may also be subject to similar processes, and global synchroniety of delta(13)C can no longer necessarily be considered an indicator that such changes are related to, or caused by, variations in the burial of organic carbon.

abstract = {The Corg:P ratios of organic-rich facies (TOC {\textgreater} 1{\%}) exhibit considerable variation through the Phanerozoic, from {\textless} 10:1 in the Permian Phosphoria Formation to {\textgreater} 1000:1 in some Devonian black shales. Relative to the composition of phytoplankton (C:P {\~{}} 106:1), which provide the bulk of organic C and P to organic-rich marine sediments, the range of Phanerozoic sedimentary Corg:P ratios largely reflects the influence of benthic redox conditions on diagenetic pathways of C and P remobilization. Enhanced preservation of organic C at lower redox potentials combined with enhanced sedimentary retention of remineralized organic P at higher redox potentials results in a strong relationship between benthic redox conditions and sedimentary Corg:P ratios. The strong secular coherence of the Phanerozoic Corg:P record (i.e., limited variation within narrow time slices) suggests that these ratios are controlled primarily by factors influencing benthic redox conditions on a global scale, such as atmospheric pO2. Inversion and scaling of the Phanerozoic Corg:P record yields a new atmospheric pO2 model that has strong similarities to existing models based on elemental and isotopic mass balances, yet differs in some potentially significant respects. In particular, the new model suggests that atmospheric pO2 was markedly lower during the Early to Middle Paleozoic than previously inferred. During most of the Devonian, atmospheric O2 levels may have been sufficiently low ({\textless} 13{\%}) as to prevent the sustained combustion of plant material. This feature of the model may account for an anomalous gap in the fossil charcoal record during the Devonian. The redox-dependent burial of P in the ocean results in positive and negative feedback mechanisms that tend to stabilize atmospheric oxygen concentrations on geologic timescales. Temporal variations in the burial of P relative to C suggest that the strength of these feedback mechanisms varied over the Phanerozoic.},

Chemical analysis of these different fabrics reveals a strong association between glauconite and phosphate occurring on a sub-microscopic scale. Despite this intimate association, certain deductions may be made about the mineralogy of the glauconite (notably the K concentration) and its relationship to its morphology. Glauconite and phosphate formation took place in the transitional zone between oxic and anoxic environments (suboxic zone). Iron oxyhydroxides were a potential source of phosphorus and iron, while 'sulphide fluxing' maintained pH levels appropriate for carbonate dissolution and subsequent mineralisation.},

abstract = {Hydrocarbon seeps and hydrothermal vents are now known to be common at continental margins and oceanic spreading centers worldwide, exuding fluids rich in CH4and H2S, and teeming with life based on chemosynthesis. These settings have been implicated as the crucibles for life's origin, and as locales for methane release to the atmosphere from hydrate destabilization during past climate change. Ancient vent and seep deposits are also increasingly recognized, and occur in various sizes, lithologies, biotic compositions, geotectonic settings and ages. Precambrian vents were populated with microbes, with the oldest metazoans in vent settings reported from possibly the Cambrian, but definitely by the Silurian. The oldest purported seep deposit with metazoan fossils is Silurian in age. A largely endemic and chemosymbiotic biota from modern vents and seeps appears distinct phylogenetically from those taxa of deposits older than Late Jurassic, with a shift from extant families of particular bivalves and gastropods to now-extinct family groups of brachiopods, monoplacophorans, bivalves and gastropods. An exception may be worm tubes of possible vestimentiferan origins, with a history in hydrothermal vent paleoenvironments extending back to the Early Paleozoic. Unfortunately their relatively simple morphology and particular style of preservation make comparisons with living groups a challenge. There may also be an ancient "lineage" of vent-seep restricted rhynchonellide brachiopods, which appears to have persisted in these settings from the Late Devonian through the Early Cretaceous. Because biotic components have changed in vent-seep settings through time, several lines of evidence must be marshaled to confirm the origin of suspected deposits in the geologic record. These include distinctive stable isotopic signatures of carbon, oxygen or sulfur in authigenic precipitates and/or tests of foraminiferans, certain mineral paragenetic sequences, and fluid-flow features. Lipid biomarkers also indicate biogeochemical cycling by Archaea and Bacteria, which performed sulfate-dependent, anaerobic oxidation of methane in ancient marine sediments. The origin of an endemic modern vent-seep biota has been attributed to either enhanced accumulation of Paleozoic and Mesozoic relics, or migration of various invertebrate groups into vent and seep environments during the Phanerozoic. Current databases from fossils and molecular characterization of living groups suggest that adaptive radiations and extinctions have occurred, with a range of lineage-ages represented. Fossil and molecular data broadly coincide with respect to the Cretaceous origination of vesicomyid bivalves and neomphaline gastropods in vents and seeps, but the data sets appear discordant at present for vestimentiferan tubeworms and bathymodiolin bivalves. Paleobiogeographic patterns are just beginning to emerge from studies of vent and seep fossils, and are likely to reflect past plate tectonic configurations, sea-level change, as well as the history of organic matter accumulation, burial, hydrocarbon generation, and fluid migration with time. Thus far, ancient hydrocarbon seep deposits yield more diverse fossils than hydrothermal vent deposits, the opposite of the global diversity recently tabulated for modern vent-seep species. However, in the fossil record, taphonomic processes negatively impacted on ancient vent organisms, and the number of known ancient vent systems is still relatively few compared to regional occurrences of ancient seep deposits. Future research will likely investigate many new/suspected sites, inventory numerous additional taxa, decipher underlying causes of variability among settings, and mobilize biologists and geologists to work together to solve problems that cross both disciplines. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The redox-sensitive transition element molybdenum is present in the Earth's crust at trace concentrations but is abundant in seawater, marine sediments, and ancient sedimentary rocks. These occurrences have led to the development of a suite of paleoredox proxies based on the bulk concentration of Mo, its isotopic composition, and the covariation of Mo with total organic carbon (TOC) in ancient black shales. However, these proxies have almost exclusively targeted the identification and interpretation of euxinic environments, where bottom waters are both anoxic and sulfidic. Here we present a discussion of the Mo geochemistry of non-euxinic sediments, where hydrogen sulfide is sometimes present yet always restricted to pore waters. We propose a new paleoredox application that uses Mo concentrations to help distinguish between environments where sulfide was present in the bottom waters and environments where sulfide was restricted to pore waters. Under ideal conditions, it is also possible to infer the presence of Mn-oxides recycling in non-euxinic paleoenvironments based on the Mo isotope composition of ancient black shales, providing a critical constraint on bottom water oxygenation.},

abstract = {The fossil record of marine animals suggests that diversity-dependent processes exerted strong control on biodiversification: after the Ordovician Radiation, genus richness did not trend for hundreds of millions of years. However, diversity subsequently rose dramatically in the Cretaceous and Cenozoic (145 million years ago-present), indicating that limits on diversification can be overcome by ecological or evolutionary change. Here, we show that the Cretaceous-Cenozoic radiation was driven by increased diversification in animals that transfer sperm between adults during fertilization, whereas animals that broadcast sperm into the water column have not changed significantly in richness since the Late Ordovician (∼450 million years ago). We argue that the former group radiated in part because directed sperm transfer permits smaller population sizes and additional modes of prezygotic isolation, as has been argued previously for the coincident radiation of angiosperms. Directed sperm transfer tends to co-occur with many ecological traits, such as a predatory lifestyle. Ecological specialization likely operated synergistically with mode of fertilization in driving the diversification that began during the Mesozoic marine revolution. Plausibly, the ultimate driver of diversification was an increase in food availability, but its effects on the fauna were regulated by fundamental reproductive and ecological traits.},

Results suggest that extinction risks will accelerate with future global temperatures, threatening up to one in six species under current policies. Extinction risks were highest in South America, Australia, and New Zealand, and risks did not vary by taxonomic group. Realistic assumptions about extinction debt and dispersal capacity substantially increased extinction risks.

abstract = {The recent proliferation of stratigraphic studies of ??13C variation in carbonates and organic C in later Neoproterozoic and basal Cambrian successions (??? 850-530 Ma) indicates a strong oscillating trend in the C-isotopic composition of surface seawater. Alone, this trend does not adequately characterize discrete intervals in Neoproterozoic time. However, integrated with the vectorial signals provided by fossils and Sr-isotopic variations, C isotope chemostratigraphy facilitates the interbasinal correlation of later Neoproterozoic successions. Results of these studies are evaluated in terms of four stratigraphic intervals: (1) the Precambrian/Cambrian boundary, (2) the post-Varanger terminal Proterozoic, (3) the late Cryogenian, and (4) the early Cryogenian. Where biostratigraphic or radiometric data constrain the age of Neoproterozoic sedimentary sequences, secular variations in C and Sr isotopes can provide a level of stratigraphic resolution exceeding that that provided by fossils alone. Isotopic data place strong constraints on the chemical evolution of seawater, linking it to major tectonic and paleoclimatic events. They also provide a biogeochemical framework for the understanding of the initial radiation of macroscopic metazoans, which is associated stratigraphically, and perhaps causally, with a global increase in the burial of organic C and a concomitant rise of atmospheric O2. ?? 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Down-core trends for extents of iron sulfidation in upper Holocene microlaminated deposits of the Black Sea abyssal plain imply that most of the pyrite in these sediments is formed in the sulfidic water column and/or very close to the sediment-water interface. Sulfur isotopic data for pyrite within microlaminated muds from two localities in the deep basin show striking uniformity between sites and down core, with a mean $\delta$34SCDT value of −37.2 ± 0.9‰ (1$\sigma$, n = 18). These isotopic trends support the hypothesis of early pyrite formation. Isotopic compositions of pyrite sulfur in the microlaminated bottom sediments are similar to those reported for particulate reduced sulfur collected in middepth sediment traps and to$\delta$34S values for water-column dissolved sulfide within a narrow zone immediately below the O2/H2S interface. These three sulfur reservoirs are distinctly different from the isotopic composition of ambient dissolved sulfide of the deep water column ({\textgreater}175 m), with $\delta$34S values for the deep dissolved sulfide reservoir being consistently lower by ∼2 to 4‰. These isotopic relationships suggest that iron sulfidation is occurring dominantly within a narrow, shallow region at the top of the sulfidic water mass. Isotopic data from a fine-grained turbidite collected in the deep basin and from rapidly accumulating, iron monosulfide-rich muds on the anoxic upper slope are enriched in34S relative to the microlaminated deposits. The enrichments on the basin margin reflect a large component of iron sulfide formed during rapid burial. A broad suite of geochemical data, including sulfur isotopic results, are consistent with an upper-slope sediment source for the ubiquitous muddy turbidites of the deep basin. The collective effects of reworking, transport, and redeposition result in a complete conversion of AVS to pyrite with little additional iron sulfidation. This conclusion is supported by a detailed isotopic mass balance. The present isotopic study also highlights fundamental differences in the reactivities of the iron reservoirs distributed throughout the anoxic basin. Sediments of the upper slope and the genetically-linked turbidites of the deep basin show similar extents of iron sulfidation that are significantly lower than those of the microlaminated deposits of the deep-basin floor, suggesting dramatically shorter timescales of iron reactivity for the microlaminated sediments of the deep basin. Importantly, isotopic patterns from the modern Black Sea should assist greatly in the recognition and interpretation of ancient anoxia in the stratigraphic record.},

Greater than threefold increases in ocean nutrient content combined with nutrient-trapping ocean circulation cause surface-water H2S accumulation in the paleo–Tethys Ocean and in areas of strong upwelling. Accounting for the presence of sulfide-oxidizing phototrophs in the model suppresses but does not prevent widespread release of H2S to the atmosphere.

abstract = {Conchostracan-rich beds between the Siberian Trap flood basalts and within the thick underlying Hungtukun tuffs of the Tunguska Basin can be closely correlated with conchostracan faunas of Dalongkou (NW China) and the Germanic Basin. The Germanic Basin faunas in turn can be closely correlated with the marine international stratigraphic time scale, and the accuracy of the biostratigraphic correlation of the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) is confirmed by a minimum in ??13Ccarb values at this level. These high-resolution correlations demonstrate conclusively that the PTB is located within the temporally brief but thick Siberian Trap flood basalt sequence. The PTB lies slightly above the level of the main Permo-Triassic extinction event in low latitude marine beds, which occurred at the base of the C. meishanensis-H. praeparvus conodont zone and correlates with the beginning of the Siberian Trap flood basalt event. The main end-Permian continental extinction event was somewhat earlier, within the middle of the C. changxingensis-C. deflecta conodont zone. This horizon marks a mass extinction that devastated a diverse conchostracan fauna and left only low diversity faunas at low and high latitudes. This continental extinction event horizon lies within the middle of the Hungtukun tuffs of the Tunguska Basin and 107m above the base of the Guodikeng Formation at Dalongkou (NW China). A "Triassic type" pioneer flora with numerous lycopod spores appears immediately above this level. Severe high northern and southern latitude marine extinctions occurred concurrently with this continental event, but low latitude marine biota was not then affected. This earlier event is best explained by global warming. The main low latitude extinction event in marine warm water faunas occurred somewhat later and left no signature in high latitude marine faunas or in continental faunas, but it does coincide with a rapid collapse of tropical rain forest environments (disappearance of the highly diverse Gigantopteris flora). This collapse likely was caused by global cooling due to a volcanic winter event. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {We report the benthic fluxes of O2, titration alkalinity (TA), Ca2+, NO3-, PO43-, and Si(OH)4 from in situ benthic flux chamber incubations on the Ceara Rise and Cape Verde Plateau and compare them to previously published results. We find within analytical uncertainty that the TA flux is twice the calcium flux, suggesting that dissolution/precipitation of CaCO3 is the principal mechanism controlling benthic TA and Ca2+ fluxes. At sites where the sediments contain significant ({\textgreater}35{\%}) CaCO3 and the overlying waters are supersaturated with respect to CaCO3, the ratios of the total dissolution rate to the remineralization rate are significantly less than at all other study sites. We propose that these observations can be explained by precipitation of fresh CaCO3 at the supersaturated sediment surface followed by redissolution deeper in the sediments because of metabolically-produced CO2. A numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of this explanation. In addition, surface exchange reactions in high-CaCO3 sediments coupled with high rates of particle mixing may also impact rates of metabolic dissolution and depress chamber-derived estimates of carbonate alkalinity and calcium benthic fluxes. These results suggest that at supersaturated, high CaCO3 locations, previous models of sediment diagenesis may have overestimated the impact of metabolic dissolution on the preservation of CaCO3 deposited on the sea floor. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

The observed discrepancy between the two potential paleoproductivity proxies, Batot and TOC, initiated supplementary examinations of the pore water, the geochemistry of the clay fraction, X-ray diffraction analyses, and the application of a sequential Ba extraction method of selected samples. Additionally, we analyzed down-core samples of the planktonic foraminifera Turborotalita quinqueloba and Globorotalia inflata for their Ba/Ca ratios. These analyses, which were performed for the first time on these species, were used to reconstruct past oceanic Ba concentrations. We suggest that in the study area, which is characterized by high accumulation rates, the preserved TOC content is a valuable proxy for past primary productivity, whereas the solid phase Batot contents appear to be affected by other mechanisms and factors. Peaks of total barium content in the clay fraction and of Ba/Ca ratios in the planktonic foraminifera shells found during the Younger Dryas and the Heinrich 1 event are likely to result from increased meltwater influx into the northern North Atlantic. We suggest that Ba-enriched meltwater was transmitted by the eastern boundary current system from higher latitudes to the region of the Canary Islands. Total barium contents of the clay fraction (Batot,clay) and Ba/Ca in planktonic foraminifera shells seem to be reliable proxies for this discharge of meltwater.},

abstract = {Summary A pronounced shift in the $\delta$13C of foraminifera in the latest early Miocene has been proposed by various authors. Our data in the tropical Indian Ocean show an excursion of $\delta$13C signals toward heavier values, lasting for about 4 million years. The excursion is documented for benthic foraminifera as well as for deep-living and for shallow-dwelling planktonic species. The initial $\delta$13c shift occurs within Magnetic Chron 16, at about 17.5 Ma. It represents a change toward heavier $\delta$13C values by about 10/00 in surface and bottom waters. The excursion terminates at approximately 13.5 Ma. The Chron 16 Carbon shift coincides with the cessation of an early Miocene warming trend, seen in the $\delta$18O signals. The mid-Miocene cooling step (presumably associated with Antarctic ice buildup, near 15 Ma) is centered on the carbon isotope excursion. We propose that the initial carbon shift was caused by rapid extraction of organic carbon from the ocean-atmosphere system. Subsequently, the excursion toward heavy values was maintained by continued extraction of organic carbon, into ocean-margin deposits. Beginning at the end of the early Miocene, fine-grained diatomaceous sediments rich in organic matter were deposited all around the margins of the northern Pacific. In California, these sediments are known as the Monterey Formation. This formation is the result of coastal upwelling, which arose because of the development of strong zonal winds and a strong permanent thermocline. Zonal winds and thermocline evolution, in turn, depended on increasing temperature contrast between high and low latitudes. We hypothesize that a feedback loop was established, such that an initial increase in the planetary temperature gradient started thermocline development which led to organic carbon extraction at the ocean margins which resulted in a drop in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Concomitant cooling (reverse greenhouse effect) strengthened thermocline development, leading to further cooling. The loop was broken when available nutrients were used up. The total amount of excess carbon buildup, according to the hypothesis, is between 40 and 80 atmospheric carbon masses for the duration of the Monterey carbon isotope excursion. This amount corresponds to that present in the ocean, that is, one ocean carbon mass.},

abstract = {International interest in CO2 capture and storage (CCS), as a method of reducing carbon dioxide emissions linked to global climate change, has been growing in recent years. CCS is particularly attractive for large industrial facilities, especially electric power plants, which contribute a large share of global CO2 emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels. This paper describes the current status of technologies to capture CO2 and transport it to a storage site. The performance and cost of capture technologies are discussed, along with related environmental issues and the outlook for improved, lower-cost strategies. The key need now is financing of full-scale demonstrations of CCS at the various types of large coal-based power plants.},

abstract = {We review Phanerozoic sea-level changes [543 million years ago (Ma) to the present] on various time scales and present a new sea-level record for the past 100 million years (My). Long-term sea level peaked at 100 +/- 50 meters during the Cretaceous, implying that ocean-crust production rates were much lower than previously inferred. Sea level mirrors oxygen isotope variations, reflecting ice-volume change on the 10(4)- to 10(6)-year scale, but a link between oxygen isotope and sea level on the 10(7)-year scale must be due to temperature changes that we attribute to tectonically controlled carbon dioxide variations. Sea-level change has influenced phytoplankton evolution, ocean chemistry, and the loci of carbonate, organic carbon, and siliciclastic sediment burial. Over the past 100 My, sea-level changes reflect global climate evolution from a time of ephemeral Antarctic ice sheets (100 to 33 Ma), through a time of large ice sheets primarily in Antarctica (33 to 2.5 Ma), to a world with large Antarctic and large, variable Northern Hemisphere ice sheets (2.5 Ma to the present).},

abstract = {Carbon is removed from the Earth's surface through the formation and burial of carbon-bearing rocks and minerals1,2. The formation of calcium carbonate and its burial in marine sediments accounts for around 80{\%} of the total carbon removed from the Earth's surface. However, the fraction of calcium carbonate that precipitates in the oceans, versus that which precipitates authigenically in marine sediments, is unclear. Here, we compile measurements of the calcium concentration of pore fluids collected at 672 seafloor sites around the globe to calculate the global flux of calcium within marine sediments.We use these data, combined with alkalinity measurements of pore fluids, to quantify authigenic calcium carbonate precipitation. We estimate that the net calcium flux into marine sediments that can be ascribed to authigenic carbonate precipitation amounts to around 1×1012 mol yr−1. As such, we estimate that authigenic carbonate precipitation accounts for at least10{\%}of global carbonate accumulation.We show that much of the precipitation occurs along the eastern margins of ocean basins, where organic matter delivery to the sea floor is likely to be high.We suggest that authigenic calcium carbonate precipitation represents a non-negligible component of the global carbon cycle},

abstract = {Methane seeps in the northwestern Black Sea are accompanied by carbonate and pyrite precipitates. Sediments were sampled at locations on the Romanian (120 m depth) and Ukrainian (180-200 m depth) shelf and slope. Layered carbonate crusts are formed of (i) carbonate-cemented siliciclastic sediment containing dreissenoid bivalves, (ii) microcrystalline high-Mg-calcite or aragonite, and (iii) aragonitic cement. The Dreissena sediment is subrecent and was deposited during the freshwater-phase of the Black Sea. It has been affected by seepage of methane-rich fluids, which induced intergranular precipitation of authigenic carbonates. The microcrystalline carbonates exhibit an intense autofluorescence. High-Mg-calcite contains 11-14 mol{\%} MgCO3. The aragonitic cement (8300-9500 ppm Sr) forms either isopachous layers or botryoids. Microbial filaments about 10-20 $\mu$m in diameter and up to 900 $\mu$m in length are preserved within and on carbonate crusts. The carbonates are depleted in13C. Microcrystalline carbonate ranges from -27 to -41‰ PDB, and botryoidal aragonite ranges from -26 to -38‰ PDB. The13C depletion indicates that the carbonates predominantly derive from the microbial oxidation of methane. Carbonate deposits do not project up into the oxic water column. They are restricted to the anoxic water column and to anoxic sediments revealing the crucial role of anaerobic methane oxidation for carbonate precipitation.14C contents give apparent radiocarbon ages of 20,640 ± 180 a BP for a sample of botryoidal aragonite and 19,110 ± 180 a BP for a sample of microcrystalline carbonate, compatible with minimum ages of carbon derived from a fossil hydrocarbon source. The $\delta$18O values of methanederived carbonates show a narrow range from +1.2 to +0.2‰ PDB.87Sr/86Sr ratios of microcrystalline carbonate (mean 0.70927) and aragonitic cement (mean 0.70918) are indistinguishable from ambient seawater (mean 0.70917) and thus indicate a shallow Sr source. Higher87Sr/86Sr ratios of the Dreissena sediment (mean 0.71005) are probably caused by Sr derived from detrital mica. Carbonates are accompanied by blocks and crusts composed of pyrite. The framboidal sulphide exhibits a palisade-like fabric with framboids arranged to parallel pillars. Sulphur isotopic ratios ($\delta$34S) ranging from +16.8 to + 19.7‰ CDT indicate that the sulphur derives not from the34S-depleted H2S of the water column or the uppermost sediment layers. Most likely, pyrite formed in the lacustrine sediments after the first incursion of Mediterranean seawater. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The $\delta$13C values of Rivularia calcites deposited in summer were significantly higher than those deposited during winter. This was interpreted as the result of photosynthetic activity within colonies. The $\delta$13C values were similar for the three cyanobacterium species studied, and colonies of Homoeothrix sampled over a 531‐m length of stream showed progressive downstream enrichment of 13C (2.0‰). This resulted from CO2 degassing of the downstream water, augmented during summer by bryophyte photosynthesis. Subsequent deposition of calcite takes place irrespective of photosynthetic activity of the algae and may blur the isotopic characteristics in older colonies and fossil assemblages.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Bulk-carbonate carbon isotope measurements are a widely applied proxy for investigating the ancient biogeochemical carbon cycle. Temporal carbon isotope trends serve as a prime stratigraphic tool, with the inherent assumption that bulk micritic carbonate rock is a faithful geochemical recorder of the isotopic composition of seawater dissolved inorganic carbon. However, bulk-carbonate rock is also prone to incorporate diagenetic signals. The aim of the present study is to disentangle primary trends from diagenetic signals in carbon isotope records which traverse the Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic boundary in marine carbonate-bearing sequences of Iran and South China. By pooling newly produced and published carbon isotope data we confirm that a global first-order trend towards depleted values exists. However, a large amount of scatter is superimposed on this geochemical record. In addition, we observe a temporal trend in the amplitude of this residual {\textless}i{\textgreater}{\&}delta;{\textless}/i{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C variability, which is reproducible for the two studied regions.

Numerical model calculations highlight that early diagenetic carbonate rock stabilization, and linked carbon isotope alteration, can be controlled by organic matter supply and subsequent microbial remineralization. Low marine sulfate and a major biotic decline among late Permian bottom-dwelling organisms facilitated a spatial increase in heterogeneous organic carbon accumulation, causing varying degrees of carbon isotope overprint. A simulated time series suggests that a 50{\&}thinsp;{\%} increase in the spatial scatter of organic carbon relative to the average, in addition to an imposed increase in the likelihood of sampling cements formed by microbial calcite nucleation to one out of 10 samples, is sufficient to induce the observed signal of carbon isotope variability. These findings put constraints on the application of Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic carbon isotope chemostratigraphy based on whole-rock samples, which appears less refined than classical biozonation dating schemes. On the other hand, this signal of increased carbon isotope variability concurrent with the largest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic may inform about local carbon cycling mediated by spatially heterogeneous (sub)-seafloor microbial communities under suppressed bioturbation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Geochemical analyses of extraordinarily well preserved late Aptian–early Albian foraminifera from Blake Nose (Ocean Drilling Program Site 1049) reveal rapid shifts of $\delta$18O, $\delta$13C, and 87Sr/88Sr in the subtropical North Atlantic that may be linked to a major planktic foraminifer extinction event across the Aptian/Albian boundary. The abruptness of the observed geochemical shifts and their coincidence with a sharp lithologic contact is explained as an artifact of a previously undetected hiatus of 0.8–1.4 million years at the boundary contact, but the values before and after the hiatus indicate that major oceanographic changes occurred at this time. 87Sr/88Sr increase by {\~{}}0.000 200, $\delta$13C values decrease by 1.5‰ to 2.2‰, and $\delta$18O values decrease by {\~{}}1.0‰ (planktics) to 0.5‰ (benthics) across the hiatus. Further, both 87Sr/88Sr ratios and $\delta$18O values during the Albian are anomalously high. The 87Sr/88Sr values deviate from known patterns to such a degree that an explanation requires either the presence of inter-basin differences in seawater 87Sr/88Sr during the Albian or revision of the seawater curve. For $\delta$18O, planktic values in some Aptian samples likely reflect a diagenetic overprint, but preservation is excellent in the rest of the section. In well preserved material, benthic foraminiferal values are largely between 0.5 and 0.0‰ and planktic samples are largely between 0.0‰ to −1.0‰, with a brief excursion to −2.0‰ during OAE 1b. Using standard assumptions for Cretaceous isotopic paleotemperature calculations, the $\delta$18O values suggest bottom water temperatures (at {\~{}}1000 –1500 m) of 8–10°C and surface temperatures of 10–14°C, which are 4–6°C and 10–16°C cooler, respectively, than present-day conditions at the same latitude. The cool subtropical sea surface temperature estimates are especially problematic because other paleoclimate proxy data for the mid-Cretaceous and climate model predictions suggest that subtropical sea surface temperatures should have been the same as or warmer than at present. Because of their exquisite preservation, whole scale alteration of the analyzed foraminifera is an untenable explanation. Our proposed solution is a high evaporative fractionation factor in the early Albian North Atlantic that resulted in surface waters with higher $\delta$18O values at elevated salinities than commonly cited in Cretaceous studies. A high fractionation factor is consistent with high rates of vapor export and a vigorous hydrological cycle and, like the Sr isotopes, implies limited connectivity among the individual basins of the Early Cretaceous proto-Atlantic ocean. },

abstract = {Contemporary biodiversity loss and population declines threaten to push the biosphere toward a tipping point with irreversible effects on ecosystem composition and function. As a potential example of a global-scale regime shift in the geological past, we assessed ecological changes across the end-Cretaceous mass extinction based on molluscan assemblages at four well-studied sites. By contrasting preextinction and postextinction rank abundance and numerical abundance in 19 molluscan modes of life-each defined as a unique combination of mobility level, feeding mode, and position relative to the substrate-we find distinct shifts in ecospace utilization, which significantly exceed predictions from null models. The magnitude of change in functional traits relative to normal temporal fluctuations at far-flung sites indicates that molluscan assemblages shifted to differently structured systems and faunal response was global. The strengths of temporal ecological shifts, however, are mostly within the range of preextinction site-to-site variability, demonstrating that local ecological turnover was similar to geographic variation over a broad latitudinal range. In conjunction with varied site-specific temporal patterns of individual modes of life, these spatial and temporal heterogeneities argue against a concerted phase shift of molluscan assemblages from one well-defined regime to another. At a broader ecological level, by contrast, congruent tendencies emerge and suggest deterministic processes. These patterns comprise the well-known increase of deposit-feeding mollusks in postextinction assemblages and increases in predators and predator-resistant modes of life, i.e., those characterized by elevated mobility and infaunal life habits.},

abstract = {Chemical (Sr, Mg) and isotopic ($\delta$18O, 87Sr/86Sr) compositions of calcium carbonate veins (CCV) in the oceanic basement were determined to reconstruct changes in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca of seawater in the Cenozoic. We examined CCV from 10 basement drill sites in the Atlantic and Pacific, ranging in age between 165 and 2.3Ma. Six of these sites are from cold ridge flanks in basement {\textless}46Ma, which provide direct information about seawater composition. CCV of these young sites were dated, using the Sr isotopic evolution of seawater. For the other sites, temperature-corrections were applied to correct for seawater-basement exchange processes. The combined data show that a period of constant/low Sr/Ca (4.46-6.22mmol/mol) and Mg/Ca (1.12-2.03mol/mol) between 165 and 30Ma was followed by a steady increase in Mg/Ca ratios by a factor of three to modern ocean composition. Mg/Ca-Sr/Ca relations suggest that variations in hydrothermal fluxes and riverine input are likely causes driving the seawater compositional changes. However, additional forcing may be involved in explaining the timing and magnitude of changes. A plausible scenario is intensified carbonate production due to increased alkalinity input to the oceans from silicate weathering, which in turn is a result of subduction-zone recycling of CO2 from pelagic carbonate formed after the Cretaceous slow-down in ocean crust production rate. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The distribution of sulfur isotopes in geological materials reveals information about Earth history and biogeochemical processes. Research during the last several decades has used sulfur isotope geochemistry as a tool to better understand microbial processes (Harrison and Thode, 1958; Kaplan, 1975; Monster et al., 1979; Peck, 1959, 1962; Rees, 1973) and sediment diagenesis (Berner, 1969, 1982; Canfield et al., 1993b). Earth historians also realized this potential, as there exists a rich record of environmental change within the sedimentary records (Canfield and Teske, 1996; Claypool et al., 1980; Goodwin et al., 1976; Habicht et al., 2002; Kah et al., 2004; Monster et al., 1979; Shen et al., 2001; Strauss, 1993; Thode and Goodwin, 1983). These applications have championed the use of the two most abundant sulfur isotopes [32S and 34S], and provide a rich introduction to what the sulfur isotope record has to offer [see (Canfield, 2004; Canfield and Raiswell, 1999)]. Within the last decade, this information has been supplemented by new data derived from the less abundant isotopes [33S and 36S]. The measurement of all four stable sulfur isotopes - multiple sulfur isotope geochemistry - has expanded our understanding of biological evolution and activity, atmospheric chemistry and transport, crustal recycling, and many more fields related to Earth surface processes [see (Farquhar and Wing, 2003)]. Here, I present a review of recent works in multiple sulfur isotope geochemistry with a focus on results that inform our understanding of biogeochemical processes and Earth surface evolution. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A population of 169 Permian articulate brachiopod shells was analysed for their Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios. 51 of these, characterised as well preserved and stratigraphically well defined, are utilized for delineation of the Permian seawater strontium isotope trend. The Sr-87/Sr-86 curve shows values of about 0.7080 in the lowermost Permian (Asselian), followed by a gradual decline to 0.70685 in the Capitanian and a minor rise in the Dzhulfian and lower Dorashamian to values of 0.70715 just below the Permian-Triassic boundary. The Early Permian decrease in the strontium isotope curve that commences in the early Sakmarian is coincident with the advancing deglaciation of the Gondwana and with the increased aridity in large parts of the Pangaea. These factors may have led to a reduced continental weathering of Rb-rich silicate rocks, and thus to the decline in seawater Sr-87/Sr-86. Starting with the Artinskian, the opening of the Neotethys and the associated widespread basaltic volcanism supplied low radiogenic strontium to seawater from an enhanced hydrothermal flux. In the Capitanian, basaltic volcanism in the entire Palaeotethys ceased and this may have been the reason for a slightly more radiogenic, seawater isotopic composition during the Lopingian. Higher input of riverine Sr due to expansion of humid areas may have been a contributory factor. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Paleomagnetic and paleoclimatic data provide the most useful latitudinal constraints for plate reconstructions. Distributions through the Paleozoic of five types of climatically sensitive sediments (coals, evaporites, reefs, dolomites and limestones) for south China, north China and Tarim are shown on 15 maps that include 1578 reliable data points. These paleoclimatic data agree reasonably well with available paleomagnetic directions, although significant divergence between the two exists for the Early Paleozoic. These data indicate the following: (1) South China was in low latitudes during the entire Paleozoic, with a subtropical position in the Cambrian. (2) North China also remained near the equator in the Early and Late Paleozoic, except for the Ordovian and the Late Permian when extensive evaporites suggest slightly higher latitudinal positions, while its Middle Paleozoic position is uncertain due to the missing stratigraphic record. (3) In south China, local tectonics appears to have played a dominant role in determining paleogeography and therefore marine sedimentation, especially after the Late Ordovician-Early Silurian, because the areal coverage of marine sediments through time is distinctly different from what would be expected from published global sea-level curves. (4) Paleoclimatic and paleomagnetic data are compatible with biogeographic data which suggest that south China was part of eastern Gondwana in the Early Paleozoic, but was widely separated from Gondwana in the Late Paleozoic, and the split between the two probably happened in the Devonian, giving rise to a major break-up unconformity in central south China.},

abstract = {Concentrations of magnetite were determined, with depth, in sediments of varying H2S content taken from Long Island Sound (FOAM, NWC, and Sachem sites) and from a site in the rapidly depositing subaqueous portion of the Mississippi Delta. For the three Long Island Sound sites, dissolution of magnetite during burial is clearly demonstrated, and for all four sites the rate of magnetite dissolution is proportional to the concentration of dissolved pore water sulfide. By combining magnetite depth distributions with sedimentation rate data and measurements of dissolved sulfide, we find that magnetite dissolution is well described by the following rate law: dCmag dt = -1.1× 10-5C0.5BCmagAmag where Cmag is the concentration of magnetite (grams per gram of sediment), Cs is the concentration of dissolved sulfide (mM), and Amag is the specific surface area of magnetite in the sediment (cm2 per gram of magnetite.) This equation means that, for a typical range of magnetite surface areas and dissolved sulfide concentrations, the "half-life" of magnetite in anoxic marine sediments ranges from about 50 to 1000 years. SEM observations of magnetite grains from the different sediment sites reveal that magnetite dissolution may be accompanied by extensive replacement by pyrite. This only occurs if magnetite is in contact with high concentrations of H2S ({\textgreater}1 mM) for relatively long periods of time (several hundred years). With low concentrations of H2S ({\textless}1 mM) magnetite dissolution occurs without identifiable pyrite replacement. We suggest that this feature of magnetite diagenesis may prove to be a useful paleosulfide indicator. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

The purpose of this paper is to test a similar suggestion for Oman. I review the late Palaeozoic to end-Mesozoic tectonic evolution of the Middle Eastern Tethysides in terms of a new tectonic model, whose main tenet is to regard the late Palaeozoic to Late Triassic basements of the Pontide/Dzirula/Adzharia-Trialeti/Arvin-Karabagh/Sanandaj -- Sirjan zones collectively as a NNE-facing Palaeo-Tethyan magmatic arc, here named the Podataksasi arc' (or zone') whose Jurassic--Cretaceous movement with respect to Eurasia was responsible for much of the coeval deformation in Iran and Transcaucasia. The late Palaeozoic deformation of the Omani basement is regarded as a part of the retroarc fold and thrust belt of this arc and therefore independent of the Hercynides in Europe and NW Africa. The arc may have been compressional in late Carboniferous to possibly early Permian time and turned extensional in the earlier middle Permian. As a result, it rifted from NE Gondwana-Land, opening, successively, the Hawasina basin in the middle Permian and the main Neo-Tethyan ocean in the Triassic, together forming the Omani Neo-Tethyan back-arc basin complex'. Nearly all of the tectonic and magmatic characteristics of this basin complex are compatible with a back-arc basin interpretation, except perhaps the anomalously far inland location of the initial rift axis. A rather complete Mesozoic tectonic history of the entire Middle Eastern Tethysides is given to justify the model presented.},

Second-order Raman peaks, though less intensive, also show systematic peak shifting as a function of Ro.

The results are compared with the chemistry, and $\delta$13C and 87Sr/86Sr values of the associated porewater. Petrographic relationships indicate that dolomite forms as a primary precipitate in porous diatom ooze and siliciclastic sediment and is not replacing the small amounts of precursor carbonate. Dolomite precipitation often pre-dates the formation of framboidal pyrite. Most dolomite layers show 87Sr/86Sr-ratios similar to the composition of Quaternary seawater and do not indicate a contribution from the hypersaline brine, which is present at a greater burial depth. Also, the $\delta$13C values of the dolomite are not in equilibrium with the $\delta$13C values of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the associated modern porewater. Both petrography and 87Sr/86Sr ratios suggest a shallow depth of dolomite formation in the uppermost sediment ({\textless}30 m below the seafloor). A significant depletion in the dissolved Mg and Ca in the porewater constrains the present site of dolomite precipitation, which co-occurs with a sharp increase in alkalinity and microbial cell concentration at the sulphate–methane interface. It has been hypothesized that microbial ‘hot-spots', such as the sulphate–methane interface, may act as focused sites of dolomite precipitation. Varying $\delta$13C values from −15‰ to +15‰ for the dolomite are consistent with precipitation at a dynamic sulphate–methane interface, where $\delta$13C of the dissolved inorganic carbon would likewise be variable. A dynamic deep biosphere with upward and downward migration of the sulphate–methane interface can be simulated using a simple numerical diffusion model for sulphate concentration in a sedimentary sequence with variable input of organic matter. Thus, the study of dolomite layers in ancient organic carbon-rich sedimentary sequences can provide a useful window into the palaeo-dynamics of the deep biosphere.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction, the most severe biotic crisis in the Phanerozoic, was accompanied by climate change and expansion of oceanic anoxic zones. The partitioning of sulfur among different exogenic reservoirs by biological and physical processes was of importance for this biodiversity crisis, but the exact role of bioessential sulfur in the mass extinction is still unclear. Here we show that globally increased production of organic matter affected the seawater sulfate sulfur and oxygen isotope signature that has been recorded in carbonate rock spanning the Permian−Triassic boundary. A bifurcating temporal trend is observed for the strata spanning the marine mass extinction with carbonate-associated sulfate sulfur and oxygen isotope excursions toward decreased and increased values, respectively. By coupling these results to a box model, we show that increased marine productivity and successive enhanced microbial sulfate reduction is the most likely scenario to explain these temporal trends. The new data demonstrate that worldwide expansion of euxinic and anoxic zones are symptoms of increased biological carbon recycling in the marine realm initiated by global warming. The spatial distribution of sulfidic water column conditions in shallow seafloor environments is dictated by the severity and geographic patterns of nutrient fluxes and serves as an adequate model to explain the scale of the marine biodiversity crisis. Our results provide evidence that the major biodiversity crises in Earth's history do not necessarily implicate an ocean stripped of (most) life but rather the demise of certain eukaryotic organisms, leading to a decline in species richness.},

abstract = {Apatite is a minor but ubiquitous mineral in most igneous rocks. Although the modal proportion of apatite in common rocks is generally low, it can reach high concentrations in enclaves, cumulates, and other rocks of low abundance (i.e., rocks that constitute a small volume of the crust and mantle; e.g., nelsonites). The presence of apatite in most rocks is due not only to its low solubility in naturally occurring melts and aqueous solutions, but also to the limited ability of common rock-forming minerals to accept the amount of phosphorus that occurs in most rocks into their structure. In this paper, we will discuss some aspects of the occurrence, texture, composition, physical chemistry and petrogenetic significance of apatite in felsic rocks (i.e., andesite to rhyolite, and their plutonic analogs), in mafic (i.e., basalts and related rocks, and plutonic analogs), and ultramafic rocks of the Earth's crust and mantle.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Early Earth processes are typically identified through the study of mineralogical, elemental and isotopic features in the rock record, including Precambrian banded iron formations (BIF). However, post-depositional processes often obscure the primary geochemical signals, making the use of BIF as proxies for paleo-seawater and the paleo-biosphere potentially imprecise. Thus, alternative approaches are required to complement the information gained from the rock record in order to fully understand the distinctive biogeochemical processes on ancient Earth. Simulating these conditions in the laboratory is one approach, but this approach can never fully replicate the complexity of a natural environment. Therefore, finding modern environments with a unique set of geochemical and microbiological characteristics to use as analogues for BIF depositional environments can provide invaluable information. In this review, we provide an overview of the chemical, physical and biological parameters of modern, ferruginous lakes that have been used as analogue BIF environments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To retrospectively evaluate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) on magnetic resonance (MR) images and the perfusion parameters of lesions that show brain swelling without concomitant parenchymal hypoattenuation on computed tomographic (CT) scans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Review board approval was obtained, and informed consent was waived. A total of 14 patients (seven men and seven women; mean age, 64 years +/- 11) were retrospectively selected from the consecutive 172 patients with acute cerebral ischemia who underwent CT within 6 hours of symptom onset. All patients had brain swelling without parenchymal hypoattenuation, including loss of gray-white matter distinction on CT scans, and they underwent diffusion- and perfusion-weighted MR imaging shortly after CT. CT attenuation, ADC, and perfusion parameters of relative cerebral blood volume (CBV), time to peak (TTP), and relative cerebral blood flow (CBF) were calculated for gray and white matter of the lesion. The measured values were compared with those of the contralateral hemisphere by using the paired t test; comparison of values of perfusion parameters among three subgroups was performed with the Kruskal-Wallis test. Arterial occlusions were determined with MR angiography or conventional angiography. RESULTS: The mean interval between initial CT and MR imaging was 2.4 hours +/- 0.9 (range, 0.4-3.4 hours). The ADC of lesions was similar to that of contralateral normal tissue (mean ADC ratio for gray matter and white matter, 0.99 and 0.97, respectively) (P {\textgreater} .05). Lesions had an increased relative CBV (P {\textless} .001), a mild to moderate TTP delay (P {\textless} ;001), and a variable but not statistically significant reduction of relative CBF. The mean relative CBF of gray matter was less in patients who had complete infarction (0.81 +/- 0.16) than that in patients with partial infarction (0.99 +/- 0.16) or those with a normal radiologic outcome (1.12 +/- 0.22), but this difference was not statistically significant (P {\textgreater} .05). Proximal cerebral artery occlusions were found in all patients. In five (36{\%}) patients, the lesion did not progress to infarction at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The CT sign of brain swelling without concomitant parenchymal hypoattenuation in patients with acute cerebral ischemia does not represent severe ischemic damage and may suggest ischemic penumbral or oligemic tissue.

Raritas is written in Python and can be run as a standalone app for recent versions of either MacOS or Windows, or from the command line as easily customized source code. The program explicitly supports a rare category count mode which makes it easier to collect quantitative data on rare categories, for example, rare species which are important in biodiversity surveys. Lastly, we describe the file format used by Raritas and propose it as a standard for storing geologic biodiversity data. ‘Stratigraphic occurrence data' file format combines extensive sample metadata and a flexible structure for recording occurrence data of species or other categories in a series of samples.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Stable carbon isotopic analyses of organic carbon ($\delta$13C) in individual paleosol profiles from Permian–Triassic sequences of Antarctica reveal systematic isotopic variations with profile depth. These variations are in many cases analogous to those in modern soils, which are functions of redox conditions, soil development, and degree and type of microbial decay. In modern soils, these isotopic depth functions develop independently from vegetation changes (C3 versus C4 vegetation) and can be diagnostic of soil orders. This study shows that soil-intrinsic functions can be preserved in the $\delta$13C values of paleosols as old as 260 Ma and constitute valuable data for paleoecological interpretations.A large carbon isotopic offset of as much as 10‰ in whole paleosol profiles across the Permian-Triassic boundary indicates significant changes in the soil biogeochemistry and the soil-atmosphere system. Early Triassic paleosols are distinctive in their extremely low $\delta$13C values (to −42‰) and often show an anomalous $\delta$13C depth distribution compared to both Permian paleosols and modern soils. Highly depleted $\delta$13C values, as the ones in Early Triassic paleosols, are suggested to be associated with microbial methane oxidation (methanotrophy). This hypothesis implies increased methane concentrations in the Early Triassic soil-atmosphere system. Increased atmospheric methane was probably partly responsible for the global carbon isotopic shift documented in marine and terrestrial sediments across the Permian–Triassic boundary.},

abstract = {The cause-and-effect relationship between the c . 201 Ma eruption of the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) and the end-Triassic abrupt climate change and mass extinction is at present based on controversial temporal correlations. Upper Triassic sedimentary strata underlying CAMP basalts in Morocco illustrate a clear mineralogical and geochemical fingerprint of early CAMP basaltic eruptions, namely unusually high contents of MgO (10–32 wt{\%}) and of mafic clay minerals (11–84{\%}). In the same rocks a coincident negative carbon-isotope excursion (CIE) is present, equivalent to the so-called ‘initial negative CIE' recorded worldwide shortly before the Triassic–Jurassic boundary. The new data show that the onset of CAMP activity preceded the end-Triassic carbon cycle disruption and that the initial negative CIE is unequivocally synchronous with CAMP volcanism. The results of this study strongly support the hypothesis that the culmination of pollution of atmosphere and seawater by CAMP-derived volcanic gases was the proximate cause of the end-Triassic mass extinction.

The Iran assemblage, part of Gondwana during the Palaeozoic, rifted away by the end of the Permian. The authors ascertain the southern-hemisphere palaeoposition of Iran at that time using magnetostratigraphy and show that it was situated close to Arabia, near to its relative position today. A northward transit of this block during the Triassic is shown, with an estimated expansion rate of the Neotethyan ridge of 100-140 km Myr-1. The northward convergence with respect to Eurasia ended during the Ladinian (Middle Triassic), and is marked by a collision in the northern hemisphere with the Turan platform, which was the southern margin of the Eurasian continent at that time. No north-south component of shortening is evidenced north of Iran afterwards. An analysis of the declinations from the Late Permian to the present shows different, large rotations, emphasizing the important tectonic phases suffered since the Triassic. Finally, the authors propose palaeomagnetic reconstructions of the Tethys area during the Late Permian and the Late Triassic, showing that the Palaeotethys Ocean was narrower than previously thought, and did not widen its gate to the Panthalassa before the Triassic period.},

The paleoecology, shell mineralogy, and paleobiogeographic context of these well-preserved bivalves suggest they are part of eurytopic opportunistic paleocommunities flourishing in a time of crisis and are consistent with some, but not all, of the paleoenvironmental scenarios hypothesized in the context of synchronous volcanic activity. The best model-to-data fit is found for an ocean acidification scenario, which predicts an increased extinction risk for taxa with thick calcareous skeletons and aragonite mineralogy due to reduced CaCO3 saturation of seawater for a period of {\textless}20 kyr. Other kill mechanisms, such as climatic change and reduced salinity in nearshore marine settings, are less well supported but not fully incompatible with our data and might have acted in concert with ocean acidification.

abstract = {Organics are expected to exist on Mars based on meteorite infall, in situ production, and any possible biological sources. Yet they have not been detected on the martian surface; are they there, or are we not capable enough to detect them? The Viking gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer did not detect organics in the headspace of heated soil samples with a detection limit of parts per billion. This null result strongly influenced the interpretation of the reactivity seen in the Viking biology experiments and led to the conclusion that life was not present and, instead, that there was some chemical reactivity in the soil. The detection of perchlorates in the martian soil by instruments on the Phoenix lander and the reports of methane in the martian atmosphere suggest that it may be time to reconsider the question of organics. The high-temperature oxidizing properties of perchlorate will promote combustion of organics in pyrolytic experiments and may have affected the ability of both Phoenix's organic analysis experiment and the Viking mass spectrometer experiments to detect organics. So the question of organics on Mars remains open. A primary focus of the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory will be the detection and identification of organic molecules by means of thermal volatilization, followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry--as was done on Viking. However, to enhance organic detectability, some of the samples will be processed with liquid derivatization agents that will dissolve organics from the soil before pyrolysis, which may separate them from the soil perchlorates. Nonetheless, the problem of organics on Mars is not solved, and for future missions other organic detection techniques should therefore be considered as well.},

abstract = {The mechanisms for uptake of inorganic carbon (Ci) for photosynthesis and calcification of a perforate foraminifer, Amphistegina lobifera Larsen, and an imperforate species Amphisorus hemprichii Ehrenberg, from the Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea were studied in 1986-1987 using 14C tracer techniques. Total Ci uptake of A. lobifera and photosynthetic carbon uptake of A. hemprichii fit the Hill-Whittingham equation that describes the overall rate of enzymatic reactions that are provided with their substrate through a diffusion barrier. This suggests that diffusion is the rate limiting step for total Ci uptake in A. lobifera. Photosynthesis by the isolated symbionts and uptake of CO32- for calcification obey Michaelis-Menten kinetics indicating that enzymatic reactions determine the rate of the separate processes. Both photosynthesis and calcification can be inhibited without affecting each other. Calcification rates in A. lobifera were optimal at Ca levels around normal seawater concentration and were sensitive to inhibitors of respiratory adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation and Ca-ATP-ase. This indicates that Ca uptake is also active. Calcification rates of A. hemprichii increased linearly as a function of external Ci concentration over the entire experimental range (0 to 4 mM Ci). In contrast, photosynthetic rates showed Hill-Whittingham type kinetics. The dependence of calcification on the CO32- concentration was also linear, suggesting that its diffusion is the rate limiting step for calcification in A. hemprichii. Increasing Ca concentrations yielded higher calcificatin rates over the entire range measured (0 to 40 mM Ca). Calcification in A. hemprichii was less sensitive to inhibitors of ATP generation than in A. lobivera, suggesting that in A. hemprichii energy supply is less important for this process.},

abstract = {Porewaters in site 680 Peru Margin sediments contain dissolved sulfide over a depth of approximately 70 m which, at a sedimentation rate of 0.005 cm yr-1, gives a sediment exposure time to dissolved sulfide of about 1.4 × 106 yr. Reactions with dissolved sulfide cause the site 680 sediments to show a progressive decrease in a poorly-reactive silicate iron fraction, defined as the difference between iron extracted by dithionite (FeD) at room temperature and that extracted by boiling concentrated HCl (FeH), normalised to the total iron content (FeT). Straight line plots are obtained for In [(FeH - FeD)/FeT] against time of burial, from which a first order rate constant of 0.29 × 10-6 yr-1 (equivalent to a half-life of 2.4 × 106 yr) can be derived for the sulfidation of this silicate iron. Comparable half-lives are also found for the same poorly-reactive iron fraction in the nearby site 681 and 684 sediments. This silicate Fe fraction comprises 0.8-1.0{\%} Fe, only 30-60{\%} of which reacts even with 1.5-3 million years exposure to dissolved sulfide. Diagenetic models based on porewater concentrations of sulfate and sulfide, and solid phase iron contents, at site 680 are consistent in indicating that this poorly-reactive iron fraction is only sulfidized on a million year time scale. Silicate iron not extracted by HCl can be regarded as unreactive towards dissolved sulfide on the time scales encountered in marine sediments.},

abstract = {Francolite-bound sulphate sulphur isotope compositions from the 570±20 Ma Doushantuo Formation are used to constrain seawater $\delta$34S during the late Neoproterozoic. Phosphorites of the lower ore have $\delta$34S compositions between 32.3‰ and 37.8‰, averaging 36.1‰, $\delta$13C values between -4‰ and -1‰, and do not exhibit anomalous cerium depletion. By contrast, phosphorites of the upper ore, which contains some of the earliest animal fossils known, have $\delta$34S between 31.6‰ and 34.5‰, averaging 33.3‰, $\delta$13C values between -1‰ and +2‰, and exhibit a distinct negative cerium anomaly. The retention of a cerium anomaly in these upper Doushantuo phosphorites implies that oxidising conditions prevailed during early diagenetic REE scavenging, indicating that these samples are more likely to retain a seawater sulphur isotope composition. On this basis we argue that seawater $\delta$34S was 32‰ (±2‰) during the deposition of the upper Doushantuo unit. The slightly higher values of the lower Doushantuo unit may reflect either slightly higher ambient seawater $\delta$34S or isotopic fractionation due to bacterial sulphate reduction. Almost identical constraints on seawater $\delta$34S have been reported from lowermost Cambrian phosphorites across South China, indicating that seawater $\delta$34S was similar at ∼570 and ∼540 Ma. A critical examination of all published data provides no firm evidence for major fluctuations in seawater sulphate $\delta$34S during the Neoproterozoic-Phanerozoic transition interval. This indicates that the onset of pervasive bioturbation had only a negligible effect on global pyritisation rates and questions recent reports of massive fluctuations in seawater sulphate $\delta$34S in response to the "Snowball Earth" glaciations. The existing $\delta$34S record is consistent with a sustained increase in seawater $\delta$34S between 750 and 570 Ma. Shorter-term fluctuations cannot be ruled out entirely, but will require more detailed study, incorporating rigorous methodologies to constrain the effects of non-marine influences. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report the development of a modified method for evaluating different reservoirs of sedimentary phosphorus (P) in ancient marine sedimentary rocks and in modern Fe-rich sediments. Utilising the existing SEDEX scheme for P partitioning in modern sediments, we initially demonstrate limitations in the application of the original scheme to sediments and rocks containing crystalline hematite and magnetite. We tested additional extractions for these crystalline Fe phases, using both synthetic minerals, and modern and ancient sediments. The addition of 6 h oxalate and 6 h citrate-dithionate-acetate extractions considerably enhanced the total recovery of synthetic magnetite and hematite to 88.7 ± 1.1{\%} and 76.9 ± 3.8{\%}, respectively. In addition, application of the 6 h oxalate extraction to synthetic P-containing magnetite recovered 93.9 ± 1.7{\%} of the Fe present and 88.2 ± 12.8{\%} of the co-precipitated P. Based upon these results we developed a modified SEDEX extraction scheme. The modified scheme was applied to modern Fe-rich sediments from Golfo Dulce, Costa Rica, which resulted in 16{\%} higher Fe-bound P recovery. Application of the scheme to a variety of ancient marine rocks increased the recovery of Fe-bound P by up to 22{\%}. We also highlight the potential for authigenic carbonate fluorapatite to convert to more crystalline apatite in ancient rocks during deep burial and metamorphism. We suggest that in such systems minimum and maximum estimates of the total reactive P pool may be calculated with and without the inclusion of crystalline P. It is noted that the application of the revised method may have important implications for understanding the cycling of P in ancient marine environments.},

abstract = {Septarian carbonate concretions contain carbonate precipitated during progressive growth of the concretion and subsequent fracture-filling. As such, they have been used to track variations in $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O of pore waters during diagenesis and to define diagenetic zones in clastic rocks. However, the $\delta$18O value of the carbonate is dependent on precipitation temperature and the $\delta$18O value of the pore fluid from which it precipitated. Interpretations must assume one of these parameters, both of which are highly variable through time in diagenetic settings. Carbonate clumped isotopes of the cement can provide independent estimates of temperature of precipitation, allowing the pore-water $\delta$18O to be back-calculated. Here, we use this technique on carbonate concretions and fracture fills of the Upper Cretaceous Prairie Canyon Member, Mancos Shale, Colorado. We sampled concretions from two permeable horizons separated by a 5 m shale layer, with one permeable horizon containing concretions with septarian fractures. We show cores precipitated at cooler temperatures (31 °C, {\~{}}660 m burial depth) than the rims (68 °C ({\~{}}1980 m burial depth) and relate that to the $\delta$13Ccarbonate values to suggest the concretion core precipitated in the methanogenic zone, with increasing input from thermogenically produced CO2. The two concretion-bearing horizons have different back-calculated $\delta$18Oporewater values (mean -2.65‰ and 1.13‰ VSMOW) for cements formed at the same temperature and similar $\delta$13C values, suggesting the shale layer present between the two horizons acted as a barrier to fluid mixing. Additionally, the $\delta$18Ocarbonate of the septarian fractures (-13.8‰ VPBD) are due to precipitation at high temperatures (102 to 115 °C) from a fluid with a mean $\delta$18Oporewater of 0.32‰ (VSMOW). Therefore, we can tie in the cementation history of the formation to temporal and spatial variations in $\delta$18Oporewater. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {The Permian magnetostratigraphic record demonstrates that a remarkable change in geomagnetism occurred in the Late Guadalupian (Middle Permian; ca. 265 Ma) from the long-term stable Kiaman Reverse Superchron (throughout the Late Carboniferous and Early-Middle Permian) to the Permian-Triassic Mixed Superchron with frequent polarity changes (in the Late Permian and Triassic). This unique episode called the Illawarra Reversal probably reflects a significant change in the geodynamo in the outer core of the planet after a 50 million years of stable geomagnetism. The Illawarra Reversal was likely led by the appearance of a thermal instability at the 2900 km-deep core-mantle boundary in connection with mantle superplume activity. The Illawarra Reversal and the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary event record the significant transition processes from the Paleozoic to Mesozoic-Modern world. One of the major global environmental changes in the Phanerozoic occurred almost simultaneously in the latest Guadalupian, as recorded in 1) mass extinction, 2) ocean redox change, 3) sharp isotopic excursions (C and Sr), 4) sea-level drop, and 5) plume-related volcanism. In addition to the claimed possible links between the above-listed environmental changes and mantle superplume activity, I propose here an extra explanation that a change in the core's geodynamo may have played an important role in determining the course of the Earth's surface climate and biotic extinction/evolution. When a superplume is launched from the core-mantle boundary, the resultant thermal instability makes the geodynamo's dipole of the outer core unstable, and lowers the geomagnetic intensity. Being modulated by the geo- and heliomagnetism, the galactic cosmic ray flux into the Earth's atmosphere changes with time. The more cosmic rays penetrate through the atmosphere, the more clouds develop to increase the albedo, thus enhancing cooling of the Earth's surface. The Illawarra Reversal, the Kamura cooling event, and other unique geologic phenomena in the Late Guadalupian are all concordantly explained as consequences of the superplume activity that initially triggered the breakup of Pangea. The secular change in cosmic radiation may explain not only the extinction-related global climatic changes in the end-Guadalupian but also the long-term global warming/cooling trend in Earth's history in terms of cloud coverage over the planet. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We determined 15N/14N ratios in modern surface and sapropel S5 sediments of the Mediterranean Sea to clarify differences in the nutrient regime associated with sapropel formation. In the modern situation, high [delta]15N of unused nitrate (15-20 [per mille sign]) remaining in the surface waters during the winter phytoplankton bloom evidences P-limitation of biological production in winter. [delta]15N of surface sediments decrease towards the east of the basin (5 to {\textgreater}2.5[per mille sign]). This is a consequence of either eastward increasing nitrogen fixation during the summer months, or of particulate matter being supplied predominantly by the P-limited winter bloom. Very low (-1-1[per mille sign]) [delta]15N values in sapropel S-5 from four locations require a very light source of nutrient-N assimilated at a minimum of ten times the modern export flux. Because the isochronous records show no spatial gradient in [delta]15N, we exclude both Ekman-type upwelling and direct riverine discharge as likely sources of nutrients. Our data are consistent with an anti-estuarine thermohaline circulation in the upper 500m during S5 time, allowing for the trapping of nutrients in the eastern basin. The most likely scenario for S5 is that phosphorus release from a relatively shallow redox boundary resulted in an imbalanced supply of N:P ({\textless}16:1) to the photic zone. The result was a slow assimilation of carbon during summer stratification and extensive N2-fixation providing the majority of the export flux from a N-limited system.},

abstract = {To investigate the role of ballasting by biogenic minerals in the export of organic matter in the ocean, a laboratory experiment was conducted comparing aggregate formation and settling velocity of non-calcifying and calcifying strains of the coccolithophore Emiliania huxleyi. Experiments were conducted by making aggregates using a roller table and following aggregate properties during incubation for a period of 40 days. Size, shape, and settling velocities of aggregates were described by image analysis of video pictures recorded during the roller tank incubation. Our results show that biogenic calcite has a strong effect on the formation rate and abundance of aggregates and on aggregate properties such as size, excess density, porosity, and settling velocity. Aggregates of calcifying cells (AGGCAL) formed faster, were smaller and had higher settling velocities, excess densities, and mass than those of non-calcifying cells (AGGNCAL). AGGCAL showed no loss during the duration of the experiment, whereas AGGNCAL decreased in size after 1 month of incubation. Potential mechanisms that can explain the different patterns in aggregate formation are discussed. Comparison of settling velocities of AGGCAL and AGGNCAL with aggregates formed by diatoms furthermore indicated that the ballast effect of calcite is greater than that of opal. Together these results help to better understand why calcite is of major importance for organic matter fluxes to the deep ocean. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Owing to their tightness, intra reservoir barriers have the potential to prevent homogenization of reservoir fluids and so cause compartmentalization. Identification of these barriers is an important step during reservoir evaluation. In order to achieve this, three main approaches: i) detailed petrographic and core analysis, ii) petrophysical studies (flow unit concept) and iii) geochemical analysis (strontium residual salt analysis) were applied systematically in the Permo-Triassic carbonate reservoirs (Dalan and Kangan formations) of a supergiant gas reservoir located in the Central Persian Gulf. Integration of these approaches has led to a full clarification of the intra reservoir barriers. Petrographic examinations revealed the potential stratigraphic barriers to fluids flow created by various depositional/ diagenetic characteristics. Petrophysical data such as poroperm values, pore throat size distribution and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were used to differentiate the reservoir flow units from non-reservoir rock. According to different trends in 87Sr/86Sr ratios of residual salts, the existence of flow barriers was evaluated and proved. Finally, by integrating these approaches, three intra reservoir barriers were introduced in the studied reservoir interval. These intra reservoir barriers are depositional and diagenetic in nature and are located in stratal positions with sequence stratigraphic significance. The possibility of reservoir compartmentalization was evaluated in the studied wells, and then their existence was predicted at the adjacent fields. As shown in this study, integration of petrographic examinations with flow unit determination in a sequence stratigraphic framework has the potential for recognizing intra reservoir barriers and predicting compartmentalization of the studied Permo-Triassic reservoirs.},

abstract = {A petrographic and biosedimentological study of the Rosso Ammonitico Veronese from the Trento Plateau (north-eastern Italy) shows that diagenetic (neomorphism, recrystallization) and biological processes (microbial content and pigmentation) influenced the formation and alteration of the carbonate matrix. The subject of this article is the interaction of early diagenetic processes and an attempt to explain the different colors of the matrix (red, pink, grey). Nearly 200 samples derived from 14 sections (Callovian to Tithonian) located in the Verona area have been studied by means of classical, cathodoluminescence and SEM microscopy. Calcite and ferruginous microfilaments of different shapes and sizes are present and tentatively attributed to fungi and iron bacteria. These micro-organisms precipitated iron oxy-hydroxides at poorly dysoxic-anoxic sediment-water interfaces. Further liberation of submicronic hydroxides (now hematite) was responsible for the red pigmentation of the carbonate matrices, originally composed of less than 1 mu m-sized micrite. Controversial smaller nanograins (0.1-0.5 mu m) attributed to nanobacteria or planktonic picoeukaryotes have been observed in the reddish samples. Recrystallization of the micrite leads to the formation of new micritic crystals, between 2 and 4 mu m in size, then to microspar crystals. Micritic textures are linked to the different colours of the samples. The intensity of the red colour is correlated with the presence of hematite (former iron hydroxides) and the presence of planar subhedral micritic grains. In contrast, pink and greyish samples are linked to the increasingly coalescent structure of anhedral micritic and microsparitic crystals.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotopes of biogenic apatite have been widely used to reassess anomalous temperatures inferred from oxygen isotope ratios of ancient biogenic calcite, more prone to diagenetic alteration. However, recent studies have highlighted that oxygen isotope ratios of biogenic apatite differ dependent on used analytical techniques. This questions the applicability of the phosphate–water fractionation equations established over 25 years ago using earlier analytical techniques to more recently acquired data. In this work we present a new phosphate–water oxygen isotope fractionation equation based on oxygen isotopes determined on fish raised in aquariums at controlled temperature and with monitored water oxygen isotope composition. The new equation reveals a similar slope, but an offset of about + 2‰ to the earlier published equations. This work has major implications for paleoclimatic reconstructions using oxygen isotopes of biogenic apatite since calculated temperatures have been underestimated by about 4 to 8 °C depending on applied techniques and standardization of the analyses.},

abstract = {This paper is the first record of pyritized mudstones (PM) in the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary section of the {\c{C}}{\"{u}}r{\"{u}}k Dağ (Taurus, Antalya Nappes, Turkey). The mudstones were generally formed as lensoidal-shaped layers or infill materials within nodular platform limestones (hardground). Normal marine fauna is diminished in the pyritized limestones, whereas tube-like microorganisms are apparently increased with the association of pyrite crystals consisting of both framboidal and cubic crystals. The total rock volumes are up to 50-60{\%} clay minerals and are mainly made up of in-situ kaolinite and subordinate mixed layer clays (illite-vermiculite). Kaolinite preferentially developed on feldspar crystals, sometimes covering ostracoda bivalves together with gypsum micronodules composed of fan-shaped gypsum crystals. The origin of the kaolinite is, in-situ, directly related to feldspar dissolution via heterotrophic bacteria. Thus, kaolinite is found along with bacterial structures. Other mineralogical compositions include established quartz (mostly {\ss}-quartz), gypsum crystals (100-200 $\mu$m) glauconite and magnetite. Magnetite grains comprise a minor amount (1-2{\%}) and show some bacterial-induced crystal orientations. Glauconite is formed as an accessory mineral that occurs as infill material in biogenic grains. On the other hand, some microspheres represented by a silica-dominated composition are only observed in scanning electron microscopes (SEM) studies under high magnification. Isotope values ($\delta$34S) obtained from the pyritized mudstones show an isotopic heterogeneity that suggests that the pyritized mudstone consists of at least two components, with different sulphur-concentrations and $\delta$34S values.},

We measured bulk organic nitrogen and carbon isotopes and trace metal concentrations from a core near Mingolsheim (Germany) to infer paleoenvironmental conditions associated with this event. Poorly fossiliferous claystones across the boundary have relatively low $\delta$15N values and low concentrations of redox-sensitive elements, characteristic of an oxic environment with significant terrestrial input. The Early Jurassic features enrichment in $\delta$15N coincident with high redox-sensitive element concentrations, indicating an increase in water column denitrification and decreased oxygen concentrations. These redox state variations are concordant with shifts in abundance and species composition in terrestrial and marine microflora. We propose that the mass extinction at the T-J boundary was caused by a series of events resulting in a long period of stratification, deep-water hypoxia, and denitrification in this region of the Tethys Ocean basin.},

Low $\delta$ 13 C glendonite values, such as those of the Washington State glendonites (as low as −21‰), have previously been interpreted as signatures of methane-derived carbon; however, the admittedly small data set obtained from the Washington State glendonites is best explained with organoclastic sulfate reduction as the alkalinity engine driving carbonate precipitation. This sur-prising finding reveals that more comprehensive work is needed to decipher the biogeochemical processes that gov-erned the transformation of ikaite to glendonite in ancient marine settings, including the relative contribution of organoclastic sulfate reduction and AOM.},

A latitudinal gradient is revealed for each interval of each epoch which can be interpreted climatically as ranging through the dry subtropical to the warm and cool temperate biomes. Floras at the dry end of the spectrum may be identified by the dominance of microphyllous conifers and the regional association with evaporites. At the other extreme, the cool temperate floras are recognized by the abundance of deciduous ginkgophytes and broadleaved conifers. The highest diversity, centered at about 40 degrees palaeolatitude, occurs in the intermediate warm temperate zone which may contain all of the above floral elements in association with numerous fern and cycad genera. The transitions between these biomes remained at relatively constant latitudes, from the late Triassic to the early Cretaceous, suggesting climate stasis over a long interval. Climate changes, perceived locally, appear to be the result of continental motion rather than true global change. During the early and middle Triassic, however, the biomes are less distinct, with floras interpreted as warm temperate extending to latitudes of up to 70 degrees north.},

In a well-focused electron multiplier it is found that anode pulse height distributions observed for different ion species agree well with distributions calculated by using compound Poisson statistics. Models are developed to explain measurement bias in an electron multiplier which is used in either the dc or pulse counting modes and it is shown how these results can be applied to isotope ratio measurements. Design and operating characteristics are described for a 20 stage electron multiplier which was developed for high speed pulse counting and high detection efficiency. The surface of the first dynode is coated with a thin film of Al2O3 to provide a stable first stage yield of 7-9 secondary electrons/incident ion for monatomic alkali ions with 20 kV impact energy. The polyatomic ion Na2BO2+ yields about 16 secondary electrons/incident ion at 20 kV impact energy. Resolving time of the entire detector system is reduced to 10 nsec by using a specially designed solid state discriminator and pulse shaper.

The localities and the geology along Hurry Inlet are described; here the formation is limnic and with dominance of arkosic sandstone intercalated with sandy shale beds. These localities have yielded the Scoresby Sund Flora with a lower Lepidopteris Zone and an upper Thaumatopteris Zone (Harris, 1937), with few species in common. The macroflora, dominated by cycadophytes, ginkgophytes, conifers, pteridosperms and ferns, shows strong agreement with NW European floras of the same age. In the microflora the form types representing the gymnospermous plant groups are normally dominant, but in some samples spores of ferns are abundant. In the systematic section about eighty species are treated. This microflora is divided into two microflora zones with subdivisions. Zone 1 characterized by frequent Ricciisporites tuberculatus Lundblad and presence of Rhaetipollis germanicus E. Schulz, Limbosporites lundbladii Nilsson, Apiculatisporis parvispinosus (Leschik) E. Schulz and Ovalipollis ovalis Krutzsch. Zone 2 above differs by the absence of the species mentioned and the incoming of Cerebropollenites thiegartii E. Schulz, Heliosporites altmarkensis E. Schulz and Trachysporites fuscus Nilsson. However, many species occur in both zones. The microflora Zone 1 comprises the Lepidopteris Zone and the Transition Region of the macroflora, and Zone 2 is equivalent to the Thaumatopteris Zone. Zone 1 is correlated with the Rhaetipollis-Limbosporites Zone known from the lower part of the Rhaetian (Middle Rhaetic sensu germanico) in NW Europe and Zone 2 with the Pinuspollenites-Trachysporites Zone of Hettangian age. Furthermore the zones are correlated with areas in Europe, Arctic Canada and Svalbard. Differences in the microflora of Scoresby Sund and NW Europe, such as low frequency of Corollina (Classopollis) in Scoresby Sund, are probably due to more northerly latitude of the area. {\textcopyright}1980.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope ratios of well-preserved brachiopod calcite and conodont apatite were used to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Middle and Late Devonian. By assuming an oxygen isotopic composition of –1permil V-SMOW for Devonian seawater, the oxygen isotope values of Eifelian and early Givetian brachiopods and conodonts give average palaeotemperatures ranging from 22 to 25 °C. Late Givetian and Frasnian palaeotemperatures calculated from delta18O values of conodont apatite are close to 25 °C in the early Frasnian and increase to 32 °C in the latest Frasnian and early Famennian. Oxygen isotope ratios of late Givetian and Frasnian brachiopods are significantly lower than equilibrium values calculated from conodont apatite delta18O values and give unrealistically warm temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 °C. Diagenetic recrystallization of shell calcite, different habitats of conodonts and brachiopods, as well as non-equilibrium fractionation processes during the precipitation of brachiopod calcite cannot explain the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite. Moreover, the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite with respect to equilibrium delta18O values calculated from conodont apatite is too large to be explained by a change in seawater pH that might have influenced the oxygen isotopic composition of brachiopod calcite. The realistic palaeotemperatures derived from delta18O apatite may suggest that biogenic apatite records the oxygen isotopic composition and palaeotemperature of Palaeozoic oceans more faithfully than brachiopod calcite, and do not support the hypothesis that the 18O /16O ratio of Devonian seawater was significantly different from that of the modern ocean.},

abstract = {Near the end of the Late Ordovician, in the first of five mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic, about 85{\%} of marine species died. The cause was a brief glacial interval that produced two pulses of extinction. The first pulse was at the beginning of the glaciation, when sea-level decline drained epicontinental seaways, produced a harsh climate in low and mid-latitudes, and initiated active, deep-oceanic currents that aerated the deep oceans and brought nutrients and possibly toxic material up from oceanic depths. Following that initial pulse of extinction, surviving faunas adapted to the new ecologic setting. The glaciation ended suddenly, and as sea level rose, the climate moderated, and oceanic circulation stagnated, another pulse of extinction occurred. The second extinction marked the end of a long interval of ecologic stasis (an Ecologic-Evolutionary Unit). Recovery from the event took several million years, but the resulting fauna had ecologic patterns similar to the fauna that had become extinct. Other extinction events that eliminated similar or even smaller percentages of species had greater long-term ecologic effects.},

abstract = {Microstratigraphic analysis of the Sunbury Shale has yielded a high-resolution record of probable short-term climatic changes in the Early Mississippian central Appalachian basin. The formation is a laminated black shale that contains pervasive millimetre-thick couplets composed of alternating thin black and thick dark gray laminae, and decimetre-thick bands that are alternately dark and light. Total organic carbon content varies at length scales corresponding to both orders of cyclicity, and correlation of total organic carbon values to X-radiograph gray-scale densities permitted rapid stratigraphic analysis of millimetre-scale litho- logic variation in the 5.0-m-thick formation. Spectral analysis of gray-scale density time series revealed strong power concentrations at intervals of 23 ± 2 and 70 ± 5 couplets. These results are interpreted to represent varved deposition of the Sunbury Shale modulated by the —22 yr Hale and —70-90 yr Gleissberg solar activity cycles.

abstract = {Marine barite (BaSO4) is produced in the water column in association with decaying organic matter; its distribution in the water column and in core-top sediments closely corresponds with the organic carbon flux from the surface ocean to the deep ocean (export production). Barite preservation in non-sulfate-reducing sediments is high, compared to other proxies used to reconstruct both export carbon fluxes (export production) and carbon burial rates. Thus the accumulation rate of marine barite is one of the most promising methods (or proxy variables) for export production and has been used to understand and reconstruct past biogeochemical processes in the ocean, including export productivity. Like any other paleoceanographic proxy, there are assumptions and complications associated with the application of barite accumulation rates in reconstructing export production. Specifically, because barite constitutes only a small fraction of the total sediment ({\textless}1{\%}), computing precise barite accumulation rates depends on accurate estimates of bulk sediment mass accumulation rates which are hard to determine, particularly at high temporal resolution. Moreover, the significance of variable barite preservation depends on seawater saturation levels with respect to barite and sedimentation rates, which have not yet been fully investigated. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of this proxy, and if used wisely, marine barite accumulation rates in marine sediments can provide valuable information about changes in carbon export to depth and the response of the carbon cycle to climate perturbations in the geological record. Ideally, to achieve higher confidence in paleo-reconstructions of export production, several independent proxies should be applied simultaneously at any given site or time interval. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Seeded growth experiments were used to investigate carbonate precipitation kinetics in natural seawater spiked with 5 to 100$\mu$mol/kg dissolved inorganic phosphate. Precipitation rates of calcite and aragonite were measured using a constant disequilibrium technique (pH-stat) (S = 35, 25°C, and 1 atm total pressure) at three CO2partial pressures (10-1, 10-2, and 10-3.5atm). Over solution pH values from 6.9 to 8.6, aragonite growth rates decrease with increasing PO43-concentration, whereas decreases in calcite rates are dependent on increasing concentrations of both HPO42-and PO43-. Linear least-squares minimization modeling of rate data indicates that calcite and aragonite precipitation rates depend on both the calcium carbonate ion molal product (mCa2+mCO32-) (saturation state), and phosphate species concentrations. In phosphate-free seawater, aragonite grows two to three times faster than calcite regardless of solution pH and carbonate ion concentration. In seawater containing phosphate, the relative rates of calcite and aragonite precipitation are determined by the ratio of PO43-to HPO42-concentrations, and are essentially independent of total dissolved phosphate and carbonate ion concentrations. These results suggest that pH fluctuations in phosphate-enriched marine pore waters may be responsible for controlling microscale variations in cement mineralogies. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {The Rhaetian marine transgression, which occurred across Europe in the latest Triassic, 205.5 Ma, famously deposited one or more bone beds. Attention has generally focused on the basal bone bed alone, but here we explore this bed, and a stratigraphically higher bone bed at the top of the Westbury Formation, and compare the faunas. The Rhaetian at Hampstead Farm Quarry, Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire, UK, has produced more than 26,000 identifiable microvertebrate remains, including teeth and scales of chondrichthyan and osteichthyan fishes, as well as vertebrae of sharks, bony fishes, ichthyosaurs, and plesiosaurs. The higher bone bed (‘bed 9') contains more small specimens than the basal bone bed, and they are also less abraded, suggesting less transport. Both bone beds yield largely the same taxa, but Rhomphaiodon minor and rare Vallisia coppi and Sargodon tomicus are found only in the basal bone bed. Duffinselache is reported only from units above the basal bone bed, but low in the Westbury Formation, and durophagous teeth only from two horizons. Four out of nine chondrichthyan species are common to both bone beds, whereas Rhomphaiodon minor and Ceratodus are absent, and hybodonts in general are rarer, in bed 9. Bed 9 is the richer source of marine reptile remains, including ichthyosaur teeth, jaw fragments, vertebrae, rare plesiosaur teeth and vertebrae, and a few Pachystropheus vertebrae and limb bones. Whereas the basal bone bed represents considerable transport and possible storm bed deposition associated with the onset of the Rhaetian Transgression, bed 9 was deposited under a lower energy regime.},

These studies, coupled with innovative modeling of environmental conditions, have produced specific hypotheses for the mechanisms that caused the mass extinction and associated environmental stress. New paleobiological studies on the environmental distribution and ecological importance of brachiopods, benthic molluscs, and bryozoans support the hypothesis that stressful ocean conditions{\&}8212;primarily elevated H2S levels (euxinia) but also heightened CO2 concentrations{\&}8212;were the prime causes of the end-Permian mass extinction. These studies also further demonstrate that both the Late Permian interval preceding this mass extinction and the Early Triassic interval that followed were times of similar elevated environmental stress. In the low-diversity Early Triassic biosphere, huge numbers of benthic molluscs, in particular four cosmopolitan genera of bivalves, typically covered the seafloor. That a few marine genera thrived during this time indicates a greater than usual tolerance to some combination of marine anoxia, as well as elevated CO2 and/or increased H2S concentrations. Research focusing on experiments with modern organisms similar to those that died, as well as those that thrived, in microcosms where levels of O2, CO2, and H2S can be experimentally manipulated will enable an even more detailed understanding of the nature of this greatest Phanerozoic biotic crisis.},

The flux of iron is found to exceed both the oxygen and the sulfide fluxes.  Because of the insolubility of iron oxides and sulfides the implication is that dissolved iron was fairly abundant and that oxygen and sulfide were rare in the atmosphere and ocean.  Sulfate, produced by the oxidation of volcanogenic sulfur gases, was the most abundant sulfur species in the ocean, but its concentration was low by modern standards because of the absence of the river-borne flux of dissolved sulfate produced by oxidative weathering of the continents.  These findings are consistent with the geologic record of the isotopic composition of sedimentary sulfates and sulfides.  Except in restricted environments, the sulfur metabolism of the earliest organisms probably involved oxidized sulfur species not sulfide.},

abstract = {A 1 m thick carbonate crust, layered and commonly domal, caps crinoidal limestones on reef complexes of the top Permian Changxing Formation in the Huaying Mountains, eastern Sichuan, China. The crust's stratigraphic level lies at a sharp change in facies, and is overlain by poorly fossiliferous laminated micrites and shales of the Lower Triassic Feixianguan Formation. The crust therefore appears to coincide with the end-Permian extinction event, although the dating of the strata is currently imprecise. The crust is composed mostly of digitate carbonate, locally thrombolitic, with remnant lobate fabric, and resembles microbialites, but is mostly recrystallised and a microbial origin is unconfirmed. It is enclosed in micrite with pyrite crystals, ostracode and other shell debris. The crust is absent from interreef areas. Previous interpretations of karstification and calcrete formation are not upheld, and the facies were deposited under water. Overlying sediments are low energy, with abundant ferroan calcite and pyrite, reflecting anoxia associated with rising sea level. Various interpretations of the crust are possible: (1) it was organic, and microbia grew preferentially on topographic highs of reef tops; (2) microbia were a disaster biota in the absence of grazers, (3) microbia took advantage of favourable conditions for calcification, associated with a rapidly rising environmental-CO2 content during the Late Permian; (4) the crust was an inorganic precipitate associated with CO2-rich water. Microbial crusts are rare after the Cambrian, but whether this crust is organic or not, its presence in these strata reinforces the view that oceanic-atmospheric conditions in the Permian-Triassic boundary interval were unusual.

Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction ( approximately 18{\%}) than mid-range ( approximately 24{\%}) and maximum-change ( approximately 35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

Relative concentrations of the C33 n-alkylcyclohexane show similar changes to the relative abundances of extinct spinose acritarchs (Veryhachium and Micrhystridium) indicating that the source organism of the C33 n-alkylcyclohexane is associated with the depositional environments/facies in which the acritarchs are identified.

@article{Pickard1996,
abstract = {Following a series of mass extinction events towards the end of the Devonian (Frasnian), true skeletal reef-building organisms were effectively lost from latest Devonian (Famennian) and Lower Carboniferous (Dinantian) marine ecosystems. Nevertheless, nonskeletal, mud-dominated buildups (mud-mounds) are common throughout this geological interval, and microbial activity (fungi, algae and/or bacteria) is considered to have played a significant role in the development of these buildups. Evidence of microbial activity in Dinantian buildups may be divided into two broad categories: (a) direct evidence, such as the development of stromatolitic and thrombolitic macrostructures, presence of cryptic incrustations and preservation of calcimicrobes such as Renalcis; (b) cryptic evidence, in the form of peloidal mud' which forms the matrix of many Dinantian buildups. The matrix peloidal micrites closely resemble modern microbially mediated (algal and bacterial) carbonate precipitates. Precipitation of the peloidal fabrics is considered to have occurred within a microbial mat that bound the accreting buildup surface, thereby allowing steep depositional slopes to develop in deep water buildups and protecting shallow water buildups from erosion. Extensive cavity systems, often developed in Dinantian buildups, may also contain stromatolitic mats and micritized cavity walls. These fabrics indicate the additional presence of internal heterotrophic microbial communities and suggest that a diverse range of microbes were present in Dinantian buildups. Controls on the development of Dinantian buildups are likely to have been multiple. Nutrient-rich (mesotrophic) water masses, in combination with relatively low sedimentation rates, may have promoted buildup initiation, while regional palaeogeography and tectonic events played a role in their location. Tournaisian buildups commonly developed in a wide range of water depths on carbonate ramps, whereas Visean buildups, particularly in northwestern Europe, were often restricted to relatively shallow water over tectonically controlled topographic highs. Evolution of new organisms during mid-Carboniferous time led to a diversification of buildup types. However, microbial fabrics identical to those developed in Dinantian buildups are still present in many late Carboniferous and Permian phylloid algal, Palaeoaplysina and bryozoan buildups. The role of microbial activity in the development of these late Carboniferous and Permian buildups may have been greatly underestimated.},

Most of the earth's prokaryotes occur in the open ocean, in soil, and in oceanic and terrestrial subsurfaces, where the numbers of cells are 1.2 ؋ 10 29 , 2.6 ؋ 10 29 , 3.5 ؋ 10 30 , and 0.25–2.5 ؋ 10 30 , respectively. The numbers of het-erotrophic prokaryotes in the upper 200 m of the open ocean, the ocean below 200 m, and soil are consistent with average turnover times of 6–25 days, 0.8 yr, and 2.5 yr, respectively. Although subject to a great deal of uncertainty, the estimate for the average turnover time of prokaryotes in the subsurface is on the order of 1–2 ؋ 10 3 yr. The cellular production rate for all prokaryotes on earth is estimated at 1.7 ؋ 10 30 cells͞yr and is highest in the open ocean. The large population size and rapid growth of prokaryotes provides an enormous capacity for genetic diversity. Although invisible to the naked eye, prokaryotes are an essential component of the earth's biota. They catalyze unique and indispensable transformations in the biogeochemical cy-cles of the biosphere, produce important components of the earth's atmosphere, and represent a large portion of life's genetic diversity. Although the abundance of prokaryotes has been estimated indirectly (1, 2), the actual number of pro-karyotes and the total amount of their cellular carbon on earth have never been directly assessed. Presumably, prokaryotes' very ubiquity has discouraged investigators, because an esti-mation of the number of prokaryotes would seem to require endless cataloging of numerous habitats. To estimate the number and total carbon of prokaryotes on earth, several representative habitats were first examined. This analysis indicated that most of the prokaryotes reside in three large habitats: seawater, soil, and the sediment͞soil subsur-face. Although many other habitats contain dense populations, their numerical contribution to the total number of pro-karyotes is small. Thus, evaluating the total number and total carbon of prokaryotes on earth becomes a solvable problem. Aquatic Environments. Numerous estimates of cell density, volume, and carbon indicate that prokaryotes are ubiquitous in marine and fresh water (e.g., 3–5). Although a large range of cellular densities has been reported (10 4},

abstract = {Changes in carbon and sulfur cycling over geologic time may have caused considerable modification of atmospheric and oceanic composition and climate. Here we calculate pyrite sulfur (Spy) and organic carbon (Corg) burial rates from recently improved Cenozoic stable isotope records, and from these rates we infer global changes in Corg burial environments. Given predominantly normal shelf-delta organic carbon burial, the global Spy burial flux should be coupled to Corg burial. However, we find that the major early Cenozoic peak in Corg burial coincides with a minimum in Spy burial. Although the calculated magnitude of variations in global pyrite burial flux is sensitive to our assumptions about the concentration of sulfate in paleoseawater, a non-steady-state isotope mass balance model indicates very low Spy burial rates during the Paleocene and a dramatic increase starting near the Paleocene-Eocene boundary, dropping off to a fairly constant Cenozoic rate beginning in the middle Eocene. High Corg/Spy burial ratios (C/S mole ratio ?15–30) coinciding with the Paleocene carbon isotope maximum most likely reflect enhanced accumulation of terrestrial organic carbon in Paleocene terrestrial swamps. We suggest that rapid burning of accumulated Paleocene terrestrial organic carbon could have significantly contributed to the short-lived negative carbon isotope excursion at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary in addition to or possibly even as an alternative to release of gas hydrates from the continental slopes. An early Eocene minimum in calculated Corg/Spy burial ratios (C/S mole ratio ?2–4) suggests that the predominant locus of organic carbon burial shifted to euxinic environments in a warm early Eocene ocean},

abstract = {Alternating light-dark laminae within stromatolites have been attributed to a phototactic response of the constituent microbial communities, whereby filaments orient vertically during the day and recline at night. This study examines the orientation of cyanobacterial filaments within a laminated siliceous stromatolite from a Yellowstone National Park hot spring to identify the controls on microfabric development and whether phototaxis plays a role. Results indicate that filament orientation is predominantly perpendicular or parallel to lamination, even when laminae are steeply inclined. Thus, phototaxis is not a significant control of microfabric development in these stromatolites. Vertical aspects of the fabric are dominated by hourglass-shaped filament bundles (hourglass structures) adjacent to rounded pores, rather than being defined by individual filaments. The rounded pores likely represent oxygen-rich bubbles generated during photosynthesis. Upon stabilization by filaments, upward buoyancy of the bubbles rotated the bundles toward a vertical orientation. Thus, vertical aspects of the fabric in this stromatolite result from buoyancy forces rather than phototaxis. Examples from the Neoproterozoic Beck Spring Dolomite reveal that similar subvertical hourglass structures are present in the rock record and may be better preserved than individual filaments. The presence of rounded pores (fenestrae) and hourglass structures in ancient microbialites, here termed the hourglass-associated fenestral fabric, can serve as an indication of biogenic influence in stromatolites, especially in the absence of preserved filaments, and may be an indication of oxygenic photosynthesis.},

abstract = {This study presents carbon and oxygen stable isotope data obtained from high-resolution sampling ({\textless}500 $\mu$m) of the brachiopod Terebratalia transversa from the San Juan Islands (Washington State, USA). The aim of this study is to unravel the respective effects of physiological and environmental controls on the stable isotopic composition of brachiopod shell calcite. Based on an SEM study of the shell, a three-dimensional sampling was performed in order to investigate carbon and oxygen isotope variations along isochrons and ontogenetic transects. The primary as well as the outer part of the secondary shell layer display large and variable isotopic offsets as high as -7‰ for $\delta$ 13C and -6‰ for $\delta$ 18O relative to expected equilibrium values. The significant positive correlations between $\delta$ 18O and $\delta$ 13C values indicate that the isotopic compositions of these shell domains are mainly controlled by kinetic isotope fractionation effects. The ontogenetic $\delta$ 13C and $\delta$ 18O variations can be used to establish a growth curve of the studied specimen whose age is estimated close to 8 years. The extent of apparent O-18 disequilibrium observed in this study is about as large as any yet measured in any organism, which makes this brachiopod an interesting and important case. The carbon and oxygen isotope compositions increase from the outer towards the inner part of the secondary layer, where they reach values of 0-0.8‰ and -0.8‰ to -0.2‰, respectively. Corresponding calculated temperatures are between 12 and 13.8 °C and fall in the range of seawater temperatures recorded off the San Juan Islands (7-13 °C). These results suggest that the calcite fibres were secreted more and more slowly during the thickening of the shell throughout the animal's life, finally approximating isotopic equilibrium.This study illustrates that the stable isotopic composition of the modern brachiopod T. transversa is predominantly influenced by kinetic fractionation and, to a minor degree, by metabolic effects. Except for the innermost part of the shell, the measured isotope ratios do not reflect environmental conditions during shell precipitation. It remains to be tested by comparable studies whether other modern brachiopod species or even fossil brachiopods reflect comparable fractionation effects. These results point out the need for re-examination of Paleozoic oceanographic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The lower member of the Alwa Formation (Lower Olenekian), found within the Ba'id Exotic in the Oman Mountains (Sultanate of Oman), consists of ammonoid-bearing, pelagic limestones that were deposited on an isolated, drowned carbonate platform on the Neotethyan Gondwana margin. The strata contain a variety of unusual carbonate textures and features, including thrombolites, Frutexites-bearing microbialites that contain synsedimentary cements, matrix-free breccias surrounded by isopachous calcite cement, and fissures and cavities filled with large botryoidal cements. Thrombolites are found throughout the study interval, and occur as 0.5-1.0 m thick lenses or beds that contain laterally laterally-linked stromatactis cavities. The Frutexites-bearing microbialites occur less frequently, and also form lenses or beds, up to 30 cm thick; the microbialites may be laminated, and often developed on hardgrounds. In addition, the Frutexites-bearing microbialites also contain synsedimentary calcite cement crusts and botryoids (typically {\textless} 1 cm thick) that harbour layers or pockets of what appear to be bacterial sheaths and coccoids, and are indicative of biologically mediated precipitation of the cement bodies. Slumping following lithification led to fracturing of the limestone and the precipitation of large, botryoidal aragonite cements in fissures that cut across the primary fabric. Environmental conditions, specifically palaeoxygenation and the degree of calcium carbonate supersaturation, likely controlled whether the thrombolites (high level of calcium carbonate supersaturation associated with vertical mixing of water masses and dysoxic conditions) or Frutexites-bearing microbialites (low level of calcium carbonate supersaturation associated with anoxic conditions and deposition below a stable chemocline) formed. The results of this study point to continued environmental stress in the region during the Early Triassic that likely contributed to the uneven recovery from the Permian-Triassic mass extinction. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hemipelagic nodular limestones are a widespread facies in the Triassic of the Tethys, often considered as being deposited at rather constant sedimentation rates. The aim of this paper is to investigate the sedimentation rate variability in a case-study from the Middle Triassic of the Dolomites, northern Italy, and to suggest possible causes. The nodular cherty limestones of the Livinallongo Fm. and correlated units were studied in four stratigraphic sections and compared to classical successions from the literature. Correlations between sections are based on ammonoid biostratigraphy and tephra stratigraphy. Correlation highlighted conspicuous changes in sedimentation rates through time and between sections, associated with sedimentological evidence of deep-water aragonite dissolution. Deep-water dissolution is believed to have resulted in small hiatuses and in a bias of ammonoid assemblages towards taxa with more resistant shells. Carbonate petrography and geochemistry provide evidence of differential diagenesis of the Livinallongo Fm. Carbonate nodules were lithified at the watersediment interface, and their C isotope composition is regarded as a proxy of the d13C of Middle Triassic bottom seawater. The onset of nodular cherty limestones, occurring contemporaneously at the basin scale, and the coeval carbonate platform drowning events are tentatively explained by the inflow and local upwelling of cool deep water from Panthalassa into the western Tethys.},

abstract = {Molecular and carbon isotopic geochemistry of hopanes in marine sediments of the Meishan section in Changxing County, Zhejiang Province of China, were studied to reveal biotic and environmental changes across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) and the Wuchiapingian-Changhsingian boundary (WCB). The hopane distribution at the PTB is characterized by high ratios of moretane/hopane, Tm/Ts, Tm/C30 hopane, C31/C32 hopane and hopane/sterane. This hopane distribution is anomalous for these marine sediments, but it is typical of coal measure strata and soils. Two possible genetic mechanisms for such an anomaly are suggested: (1) these hopanes were terrigenous and most probably originated from acidified soil and peat. This mechanism implies that the marine primary production and aerobic bacteria production at the PTB were extremely low. (2) This hopane distribution was possibly caused by freshening and acidification of the upper water column during the end-Permian to Early Triassic marine stagnation and stratification. This hopane anomaly, which coincides with the end-Permian mass extinction and carbon-isotope excursion, may signal the end-Permian mass extinctions and marine and terrigenous ecosystem collapse. The 13C-enriched hopanes with the fingerprint of typical anoxic marine shales, coupled with an n-C15-n-C17-dominated distribution of n-alkanes, strongly indicate that the organic matter around the WCB at Meishan originated mainly from cyanobacteria. The corresponding positive $\delta$13Ccarbonate, and higher total organic carbon and hydrocarbon index (HI) values, strongly suggest that high marine primary production and marine anoxia caused by intermittent cyanobacterial blooms, resulted in the local mass extinction at Meishan. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Wavelet functions are implemented in WaveletComp such that a wide range of interme-diate and final results are easily accessible. The null hypothesis that there is no (joint) periodicity in the series is tested via p-values obtained from simulation, where the model to be simulated can be chosen from a wide variety of options. The reconstruction, and thus filtering, of a given series from its wavelet decomposition, subject to a range of possible constraints, is also possible. WaveletComp provides extended plotting functionality — which objects should be added to a plot (for example, the ridge of wavelet power, contour lines indicating significant periodicity, arrows indicating the lead-ing/lagging series), which kind and degree of smoothing is desired in wavelet coherence plots, which color palette to use, how to define the layout of the time axis (using POSIXt conventions), and others. Technically, we have developed vector-and matrix-based implementations of algorithms to reduce computation time. Easy and intuitive handling was given high priority. Even though we provide some details concerning the mathematical foundation of the method-ology implemented in WaveletComp, the present guide is not intended to give an introduction to wavelet analysis. The goal here is to give a series of constructed as well as real-world examples to illustrate the use and functionality of WaveletComp, with statistical arguments in mind.},

abstract = {The carbon-isotope record of three sections of shallow-water carbonates from the Upper Cretaceous sequences of the southern Apennines (Italy) shows a pronounced positive excursion of about 4-5‰. Using the upper Cenomanian Cisalveolina fraasi level as a biostratigraphic tie-point we correlate this excursion to the OAE-2 isotopic event. Comparison with the standard reference $\delta$13C curve of Eastbourne (England) shows that the overall character of the excursion is clearly reproduced in the shallow-water curves. Chemostratigraphic correlation allows definition of the age of some important shallow-water biostratigraphic events to the precision of an ammonite zone, using the well-established bio-chronostratigraphic framework defined in the Eastbourne section. The onset of the Cenomanian-Turonian isotopic excursion coincides with a transgressive trend, recorded by the occurrence of more open-marine facies and culminating with an incipient drowning in one of the sections studied. Our data suggest that the open-ocean isotopic signal is most faithfully recorded and preserved in shallow-water platform carbonates during transgressive periods, when the effects of meteoric diagenesis and seawater ageing are less severe},

abstract = {The geographic distribution of life on Earth supports a general pattern of increase in biodiversity with increasing temperature. However, some previous analyses of the 540-million-year Phanerozoic fossil record found a contrary relationship, with paleodiversity declining when the planet warms. These contradictory findings are hard to reconcile theoretically. We analyze marine invertebrate biodiversity patterns for the Phanerozoic Eon while controlling for sampling effort. This control appears to reverse the temporal association between temperature and biodiversity, such that taxonomic richness increases, not decreases, with temperature. Increasing temperatures also predict extinction and origination rates, alongside other abiotic and biotic predictor variables. These results undermine previous reports of a negative biodiversity-temperature relationship through time, which we attribute to paleontological sampling biases. Our findings suggest a convergence of global scale macroevolutionary and macroecological patterns for the biodiversity-temperature relationship.},

abstract = {1 The oceans vast capacity to take up anthropogenic CO2 helps limit increases in atmospheric CO2, thus moderating climate. Unfortunately, this passive uptake also implies a reduction in surface ocean pH. Such ocean acidification occurs because CO2 reacts with water, increasing hydrogen ions; simultaneously, bicarbonate ions increase and carbonate ions decrease. Because passive ocean uptake cannot keep pace with increases of atmospheric CO2, there have been proposals to actively enhance ocean uptake of CO2. Both passive and active uptake of anthropogenic CO2 will also affect ocean biology via changes in ocean chemistry.},

abstract = {A high-resolution oxygen isotope record based on 356 measurements of conodont apatite from several low latitudinal sections in South China, USA and Iran was composed in order to unravel Permian palaeotemperature and ice volume history. The conodont apatite $\delta$18O record is compared to published brachiopod calcite $\delta$18O records. Brachiopods and conodonts from different palaeocontinents show significantly different $\delta$18O values, suggesting differences in local climatic conditions (e.g., evaporation/precipitation ratio). As a consequence, secular changes in palaeotemperature and oxygen isotope composition of Permian sea water cannot be reconstructed from records combined from different areas, but have to be based on records from a specific area.Oxygen isotope analyses of different conodont taxa suggest that Streptognathodus and Hindeodus lived in near-surface seawater and recorded surface water temperature, whereas the habitat of gondolellid genera was variable depending on sea level, with both near-surface and deeper waters as potential life habitat. The oxygen isotope record measured on conodonts from South China exhibits relative high values between 22 and 23‰ VSMOW during the glaciated Early Permian, translating into warm seawater temperature between 26 and 30°C, assuming that the Late Palaeozoic ice volumes were comparable to the Pleistocene glacial maxima. In contrast to the earlier view that the Late Palaeozoic Ice Age (LPIA) terminated in the late Sakmarian, the South China conodont apatite oxygen isotope record suggests waning of the ice sheets in the Kungurian. Ice melting is indicated by a pronounced decrease in $\delta$18O of 2‰ VSMOW, which is interpreted as reflecting the combined effect of climatic warming and glacial ice melting. Significant temperature fluctuations (4°C warming succeeded by 6 to 8°C cooling) are observed during the Guadalupian-Lopingian transition, interpreted as combined climate changes induced by Emeishan volcanism and changes in habitat depth of gondolellid conodonts. Oxygen isotope values increase to 22‰ VSMOW in the Changhsingian, which suggests climate cooling and Clarkina moving to deeper waters because of the Changhsingian sea level rise. Across the Permian-Triassic boundary, $\delta$18O values decrease from 22 to 19‰ VSMOW, parallel to the significant negative carbon isotope excursion and the eruption of the Siberian Traps. The latter is pointing to a cause-effect relationship as a consequence of the massive release of volcanic greenhouse gases derived from the Siberian volcanism and related processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Association for Gondwana Research.},

The $\delta$D values in five particles far exceed those in terrestrial samples and prove that the samples are interplanetary dust particles (IDPs). The hydrogen isotopic composition is heterogeneous on a scale of a few microns demonstrating that the dust is unequilibrated. Measurements of D/H ratios in conjunction with elemental and molecular ion signals in different fragments of individual IDPs show that a carbonaceous phase, not water, is the carrier of the D enrichments. Previous infrared transmission measurements have shown that IDPs fall into three main spectral classes. Particles from two of those three IR classes show large D/H ratios. Two particles studied from the third class do not. However, one of these contains solar flare tracks and is extraterrestrial. Thus, most, but not all, IDPs contain hydrogen with a non-terrestrial isotopic composition. Carbon isotopic measurements on fragments of three IDPs give ratios similar to terrestrial values and show a largely uniform isotopic composition for a given particle. Small, but significant, differences in $\delta$13C of {\~{}}40‰ between particles are seen. No correlations between the hydrogen and carbon isotopic compositions are observed. The magnesium and silicon isotopic compositions of fragments of three IDPs are found to be normal within measurement errors. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

@article{Ridgwell2005,
abstract = {The Phanerozoic has seen fundamental changes in the global biogeochemical cycling of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), particularly the advent of biomineralization during the early Cambrian when the products of weathering could first be removed through metabolic expenditure, and the subsequent ecological success of planktic calcifiers during the Mesozoic which shifted the locus of deposition from the continental shelves to the deep open ocean. These biologically-driven CaCO3 depositional 'mode' changes along with geochemical and tectonic variations in boundary conditions such as sea-level and calcium ion concentrations all affected the carbonate chemistry of the ocean. I employ a model of atmosphere-ocean-sediment carbon cycling to explore the impact of these factors on the saturation state and carbonate chemistry of the global ocean during the Phanerozoic. The model results highlight that overall; the time evolution and regulation of Phanerozoic ocean chemistry are dominated by a Mid Mesozoic Revolution in the marine carbonate cycle. Prior to this transition, it was possible for the ocean to attain states of extreme saturation during the Permian and Triassic as well as during the late Precambrian. This is primarily a consequence of low sea-level in restricting the potential area for the deposition of shallow water carbonates, thus requiring a more saturated ocean and higher rate of precipitation per unit area in order to balance weathering input. This is consistent with the occurrence of mineralogically 'anomalous' carbonates during these periods but not commonly at other times. That the modern carbon cycle does not respond to similar tectonic forcings is due to the ecological success of calcifying planktic taxa during the Mesozoic, which in facilitating the creation of a responsive deep-sea carbonate sink enabled a much greater degree of regulation of saturation state than was previously possible. The model results also highlight the primary role of changes in the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere and of Ca 2+ in the ocean in determining surface pH. The uncertainty inherent in paleo CO2 estimates then translates into sufficient uncertainty in reconstructions of Phanerozoic temperature variability that one can only deduce from the carbonate ??18O record that the Cretaceous was generally warmer and the Carboniferous colder than average. The substantially enhanced oceanic carbon inventory predicted for the Paleozoic suggests that previous calculations of methane hydrate release may have substantially underestimated the quantity of clathrate carbon required to explain observed carbon isotopic excursions. In both cases the importance of quantifying Phanerozoic marine chemistry is clear. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Conodonts from U.S. Midcontinent cyclothems were studied for oxygen isotopes in order to constrain Pennsylvanian glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations. Pennsylvanian deposits of the Midcontinent United States are composed of cyclic alternations of thin transgressive limestones, offshore gray to black phosphatic shales, and thick regressive limestones, a sequence that is underlain and overlain by nearshore to terrestrial shales with paleosols and coal beds. Glacioeustatic sea-level fluctuations are considered the primary cause for the formation of these cyclothems. Oxygen isotope analyses of conodont apatite from the black (20.1 ± 0.5‰, Vienna standard mean ocean water [VSMOW]) and gray shale units (20.5 ± 0.5‰, VSMOW) show lowest average $\delta$18O values, whereas conodont elements from the regressive (21.0 ± 0.3‰, VSMOW) and transgressive limestone units (21.1 ± 0.6‰, VSMOW) are enriched in 18O. The maximum change in $\delta$18O of conodonts from the black shale and carbonate units from individual cyclothems is 1.7‰. The 1.7‰ difference in $\delta$18O compares relatively well to Pleistocene interglacial-glacial changes in $\delta$18O of equatorial surface-dwelling foraminifers and suggests that Pennsylvanian glacioeustatic sea-level changes may have been of comparable amplitude. However, since the Pennsylvanian glacial maxima are represented by terrestrial sediments and are not documented in the conodont oxygen isotope record, Pennsylvanian glacioeustatic sea-level changes were probably larger than the 120 m fluctuations recorded for the Pleistocene glaciations.},

abstract = {The 2.1Ga Tulomozero Formation, deposited on the Fennoscandian Shield, consists of shallow marine carbonate and siliciclastic rocks, dissolution breccias and widespread syndepositional marine evaporites, now mostly present as pseudomorphs after Ca-sulfates. This study investigates sulfates hosted in three different proxies to constrain the sulfur isotopic composition of seawater sulfate, acknowledging the presence of different types of sulfates (carbonate-associated sulfate (CAS), breccia-associated sulfate (BAS) and sulfate relicts (RS)) in a variety of lithologies of the Tulomozero Formation. A widely used and accepted proxy for the ambient seawater sulfate sulfur isotopic composition is carbonate-associated sulfate which was extracted from carbonate samples across the entire Tulomozero Formation. In addition, sulfate was extracted from a siliciclastic dissolution breccia, which is suggested to have formed after dissolution of sulfate evaporites. The sulfate sulfur isotopic composition from both lithologies was measured ex-situ ($\delta$ 34S CAS=10.9±2.7‰, $\delta$ 34S BAS=9.0±1.1‰). Ubiquitous pseudomorphs after Ca-sulfates occur in the Tulomozero Formation and contain $\mu$m-size anhydrite and barite relicts. Their sulfur isotopic composition was measured in situ by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) ($\delta$ 34S anhydrite=9.6±1.0‰; $\delta$ 34S barite=11.0±3.1‰). Sulfur isotope data from carbonate rocks, breccias and the sulfate relicts match the existing $\delta$ 34S record of seawater sulfate during that time and show no distinct stratigraphic variations, indicating that the seawater sulfate sulfur isotopic composition remained unaffected from environmental changes during the time of deposition of the Tulomozero Formation.Physical evidence for widespread precipitation of sulfate (rather than abundant chloride) suggests a modern-style evaporite sequence with carbonates followed by sulfate and then chlorides. However, this requires a minimum sulfate concentration of 2.5. mM in the ambient seawater. Consequently, the evidence for persistent evaporitic sulfate deposition in the Tulomozero Formation implies a substantial seawater sulfate reservoir at 2.1. Ga. According to the estimated minimum depositional time from the thickness of the carbonate rocks of the formation, the residence time of seawater sulfate is expected to have been at least 5. Ma. The available data support the existence of a sizeable seawater sulfate reservoir in the Mid-Paleoproterozoic ocean, in fact more than 10{\%} of the modern sulfate reservoir. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Anomalous departures of rare-earth elements (REE) from similarity of chemical behaviour are most evident in a comparison of Ce with its neighbors. Under reducing conditions Ce3+ acts like other REE, but oxidized Ce4+ is adsorbed on Mn-, Fe-oxyhydroxides, or organic particulates, and consequently the remaining solution will tend to exhibit a negative Ce anomaly. In addition, more subtle fractionations may emphasize the light, or the heavy, or the middle REE. A pattern of REE may be recorded by immediate diagenesis on a suitable chemical substrate, such as apatite (fish debris, conodonts), carbonate or chert. This record was originally thought to reflect the paleoredox conditions of primary deposition. However, any such primary record may be overprinted by late diagenetic alteration. Early analyses of REE in conodonts from a wide range of sediments suggested a prevalence of reducing conditions (no Ce anomaly) in pre-Carboniferous oceans, and more common oxidation (negative Ce anomaly) in the late Paleozoic. However, recent research by other investigators indicates that variations in Cean are more diverse in origin, and in particular many are distorted to an unknown extent by late diagenesis. In any case it is now clear that geological age does not show a consistent relationship to the level of the Ce anomaly. The Ce anomaly apparently does not play any regular role in the isotopic events that accompany prominent mass extinctions. Further research is required to understand, and thus make useful, the controls on the Ce anomaly.},

abstract = {Tipping points--where systems shift radically and potentially irreversibly into a different state--have received considerable attention in ecology. Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales, the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers, we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses, and lack of strong continental interconnectivity, probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale, without an expectation of marked tipping patterns. This implies that identifying critical points along global continua of drivers might be unfeasible and that characterizing global biotic change with single aggregates is inapt.},

abstract = {We analysed diversity and abundance patterns of benthic organisms across the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary based on the Paleobiology Database (PBDB), which compiles palaeontological collection data on a global scale. While Sepkoski's [Sepkoski, J.J. Jr., 2002. A compendium of fossil marine animal genera. Bulletins of American Paleontology 363, 1-563] compendium on the stratigraphic ranges of marine animal genera suggests that the dominant macrobenthic groups of the Late Triassic experienced significant extinctions prior to the T-J boundary, a significant end-Triassic extinction peak is evident from PBDB's data. This Rhaetian extinction peak is found in both an analysis of the raw data of stratigraphic ranges and a sample-standardized analysis of occurrence data; 41{\%} of all mesobenthic and macrobenthic genera crossing the Norian-Rhaetian boundary became extinct within the Rhaetian. Although this rate suffices to characterize the end-Triassic extinction as a true mass extinction against a Middle Triassic to Middle Jurassic background, significantly reduced Rhaetian origination rates add to the strong diversity depletion in the earliest Jurassic. As for other mass extinctions, evidence for selective extinction is meagre when the analysis is limited to the boundary interval alone and when focused on taxonomic and ecological characteristics of individual genera. When taxa are separated by environmental preferences, however, several determinants of extinction risk become evident, suggesting that reef dwellers had a significantly higher extinction risk than level-bottom dwellers, taxa with an inshore preference were more strongly affected than offshore taxa, taxa preferring carbonate substrates were more strongly hit than taxa preferring siliciclastic substrates and taxa preferentially inhabiting low latitudes had higher extinction rates than taxa more common at intermediate and high latitudes. Much of this selectivity is not independent and also seen in the intervals of background extinctions suggesting that the end-Triassic mass extinction represents an intensification of background extinctions but not a qualitatively different macroevolutionary regime. One possible exception is related to preferences for depositional environments suggesting a selective Rhaetian extinction in reefs and inshore settings. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For this reason, analytical instrumental protocols for the detection of biomarkers in suitable geological matrices unequivocally have to be elaborated for future unmanned explorations including the forthcoming ESA ExoMars mission. As part of the Pasteur suite of analytical instrumentation on ExoMars, the Raman/LIBS instrument will seek elemental and molecular information about geological, biological and biogeological markers in the Martian record. A key series of experiments on terrestrial Mars analogues, of which this paper addresses a particularly important series of compounds, is required to obtain the Raman spectra of key molecules and crystals, which are characteristic for each biomarker. Here, we present Raman spectra of several examples of organic compounds which have been recorded non-destructively--higher n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carotenoids, salts of organic acids, pure crystalline terpenes as well as oxygen-containing organic compounds. In addition, the lower limit of [beta]-carotene detection in sulphate matrices using Raman microspectroscopy was estimated.},

abstract = {Past treatments of the variation of $\delta$S34 in marine evaporites have either assumed a steady-state ocean or have invoked rather simplified ocean input-output models. This paper derives more completely the relationships between the parameters that influence the time variation of $\delta$S34 in ocean water and the relationship between $\delta$S34 in ocean water and net gains and losses of atmospheric oxygen due to the operation of the sulfur cycle. The lower and mid-Paleozoic are shown to have been periods of net gain of atmospheric oxygen by the operation of the sulfur cycle; the upper Paleozoic, particularly the Permian, a period of oxygen loss. It is difficult to relate these oxygen gains and losses to variations in the oxygen content of the atmosphere, because the oxygen flux due to the operation of the carbon cycle is approximately twice as large as the flux due to the operation of the sulfur cycle. Data for the organic carbon and sulfide content of sedimentary rocks of the Russian Platform suggest that a decrease in sulfide from the Paleozoic to the Mesozoic and Cenozoic Era was roughly balanced by an increase in the proportion of organic carbon; however, such data are insufficient to define the abundance of atmospheric oxygen during the Phanerozoic. Biologic data and a better understanding of controls on atmospheric Po2 are more likely to produce convincing evidence regarding variations of atmospheric oxygen in the past.},

Based on their characteristic, columnar shaft morphology, it was previously suggested they came from a prosauropod or stegosaur. The bone histology of both specimens is very similar: the cortex is always rather thin, not exceeding 10 mm, and is of fibrolamellar type with longitudinal primary osteons. The primary osteons show a rather unusual feature, the development of a secondary osteon inside the primary one. The bone surface in both specimens shows open vascular canals, suggesting that the animals were still growing at the time of death, but an external fundamental system (EFS) is visible in the outermost cortex of specimen BRSMG Cb3870. The external cortex shows dense growth marks, but their annual nature is difficult to ascertain. The bones are probably dinosaurian, as indicated by the fibrolamellar bone, and possibly belong to an unknown basal sauropodomorph lineage. Alternatively, some very large pseudosuchians may have evolved fibrolamellar bone independently as an adaptation for reaching giant size.},

abstract = {Authigenic carbonates from five continental margin locations, the Eel River Basin, Monterey Bay, Santa Barbara Basin, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the North Sea, exhibit a wide range of mineralogical and stable isotopic compositions. These precipitates include aragonite, low- and high-Mg calcite, and dolomite. The carbon isotopic composition of carbonates varies widely, ranging from -60??? to +26???, indicating complex carbon sources that include 13C-depleted microbial and thermogenic methane and residual, 13C-enriched, bicarbonate. A similarly large variability of ??18O values (-5.5??? to +8.9???) demonstrates the geochemical complexity of these sites, with some samples pointing toward an 18O-enriched oxygen source possibly related to advection of 18O-enriched formation water or to the decomposition of gas hydrate. Samples depleted in 18O are consistent with formation deeper in the sediment or mixing of pore fluids with meteoric water during carbonate precipitation. A wide range of isotopic and mineralogical variation in authigenic carbonate composition within individual study areas but common trends across multiple geographic areas suggest that these parameters alone are not indicative for certain tectonic or geochemical settings. Rather, the observed variations probably reflect local controls on the flux of carbon and other reduced ions, such as faults, fluid conduits, the presence or absence of gas hydrate in the sediment, and the temporal evolution of the local carbon reservoir. Areas with seafloor carbonates that indicate formation at greater depth below the sediment-water interface must have undergone uplift and erosion in the past or are still being uplifted. Consequently, the occurrence of carbonate slabs on the seafloor in areas of active hydrocarbon seepage is commonly an indicator of exhumation following carbonate precipitation in the shallow subsurface. Therefore, careful petrographic and geochemical analyses are critical components necessary for the correct interpretation of processes related to hydrocarbon seepage in continental margin environments and elsewhere. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Sequestration of organic carbon (OC) in environmental systems is critical to mitigating climate change. Organo-mineral associations, especially those with iron (Fe) oxides, drive the chemistry of OC sequestration and stability in soils. Short-range-ordered Fe oxides, such as ferrihydrite, demonstrate a high affinity for OC in binary systems. Calcium commonly co-associates with OC and Fe oxides in soils, though the bonding mechanism (e.g., cation bridging) and implications of the co-association for OC sequestration remain unresolved. We explored the effect of calcium (Ca 2+) on the sorption of dissolved OC to 2-line ferrihydrite. Sorption experiments were conducted between leaf litter-extractable OC and ferrihydrite at pH 4 to 9 with different initial C/Fe molar ratios and Ca 2+ concentrations. The extent of OC sorption to ferrihydrite in the presence of Ca 2+ increased across all tested pH values, especially at pH ≥ 7. Sorbed OC concentration at pH 9 increased from 8.72 ± 0.16 to 13.3 ± 0.20 mmol OC g −1 ferrihydrite between treatments of no added Ca 2+ and 30 mM Ca 2+ addition. Batch experiments were paired with spectroscopic studies to probe the speciation of sorbed OC and elucidate the sorption mechanism. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy analysis revealed that carboxylic functional moieties were the primary sorbed OC species that were preferentially bound to ferrihydrite and suggested an increase in Fe-carboxylate ligand exchange in the presence of Ca at pH 9. Results from batch to spectroscopic experiments provide significant evidence for the enhancement of dissolved OC sequestration to 2-line ferrihydrite and suggest the formation of Fe–Ca-OC ternary complexes. Findings of this research will inform mod-eling of environmental C cycling and have the potential to influence strategies for managing land to minimize OM stabilization.},

abstract = {Black carbon-rich chert dikes are common features of early Archean terranes and are especially prominent on the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia. The dikes cut across the local stratigraphy before truncating abruptly at specific stratigraphic horizons where they can be seen to interfinger with the stratigraphic succession. These uniquely Archean dike complexes are enigmatic and raise significant questions about the source of the carbon they contain - is it biogenic, and therefore indicative of the early biosphere, or abiotic, and perhaps indicative of prebiotic conditions that led to the appearance of the first life on Earth? The Strelley Pool Chert, which is exposed on the Pilbara Craton of Western Australia, forms part of the Warrawoona Group and rests unconformably on older ultramafic volcanics. The formation, which is generally less than 30 m thick, consists of a relatively consistent lithologic succession found over a wide area. Locally, a basal transgressive sandstone is overlain by a sequence of carbonate, barite?, black and white laminated chert and grey-green chert which is locally stained blue green by weathered fuchsite. The formation is intersected by normal faults about which the depositional successions thickens and thins. The mineralogy and geochemistry (including stable isotope data) of the underlying dike complex closely parallels that of the lithologies preserved in the Strelley Pool Chert. Similarly, the depositional sequence of minerals in voids within the dike complex parallels that of the depositional sequence above. This new data from the Strelley Pool Chert and its associated dike complex show that the black chert dikes are an integral part of a hydrothermal mineralogical complex. The complex accumulated around vents fed by growth-fault-controlled dikes that extended to a depth of more than 2 km below the Archean paleo-seafloor. The mineralogy of the sedimentary succession reflects deposition during the declining temperature regime of an evolving hydrothermal system driven by an intruding granitoid complex below. The fault system and associated hydrothermal complex evolved in the tensional environment developed during doming above the intermittently intruding granitoid complex that forms the framework of the Pilbara Protocontinent. Carbonaceous compounds contained within the black chert dikes could have been generated abiotically by a process similar to Fischer-Tropsch synthesis at elevated temperatures (200-300 ??C) and pressures (500 bar) at a paleo-depth of 2 km within the hydrothermal system. The "primordial medium" in which life first evolved may thus have been a silica-rich slurry with a low pH and a high CO 2 content which contained basic abiotic organic building blocks fundamental to the origins of life. The abiotic organic output from these hydrothermal systems may overwhelm any early biospheric geochemical signal and may therefore be the most difficult environment in which to recognise the early biospheric record. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Most mass extinctions during the last 500 m.y. coincide with eruptions of large igneous provinces (LIPs). The Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction was synchronous with the Deccan flood volcanism, the Permian-Triassic extinction with the eruption of the enormous Siberian traps, and the end-Guadalupian extinction with the Emeishan volcanic province. The causal link remains disputed, however, and many LIPs apparently had no significant impact on the biosphere. Here we show that a key control on the destructive consequences of LIP emplacement is the type of sedimentary rock in basins beneath the flood basalts. Contact metamorphism around intrusions in dolomite, evaporite, coal, or organic-rich shale generates large quantities of greenhouse and toxic gases (CO(2), CH(4), SO(2)), which subsequently vent to the atmosphere and cause global warming and mass extinctions. The release of sediment-derived gases had a far greater impact on the environment than the emission of magmatic gases.},

abstract = {One contribution of 18 to a discussion meeting issue 'The Rhynie cherts: our earliest terrestrial ecosystem revisited'. Fossil evidence from the Rhynie chert indicates that early land plants, which evolved in a high-CO 2 atmosphere during the Palaeozoic Era, hosted diverse fungal symbionts. It is hypothesized that the rise of early non-vascular land plants, and the later evolution of roots and vasculature, drove the long-term shift towards a high-oxygen, low CO 2 climate that eventually permitted the evolution of mammals and, ultimately, humans. However, very little is known about the productivity of the early terrestrial biosphere, which depended on the acquisition of the limiting nutrient phosphorus via fungal symbiosis. Recent laboratory experiments have shown that plant–fungal sym-biotic function is specific to fungal identity, with carbon-for-phosphorus exchange being either enhanced or suppressed under superambient CO 2 . By incorporating these experimental findings into a biogeochemical model, we show that the differences in these symbiotic nutrient acquisition strategies could greatly alter the plant-driven changes to climate, allowing drawdown of CO 2 to glacial levels, and altering the nature of the rise of oxygen. We con-clude that an accurate depiction of plant–fungal symbiotic systems, informed by high-CO 2 experiments, is key to resolving the question of how the first terrestrial ecosystems altered our planet. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'The Rhynie cherts: our earliest terrestrial ecosystem revisited'.},

abstract = {The oxygen and strontium isotopic ratios of marine carbonates are widely employed to derive paleotemperature and age, respectively. While open ocean samples are the standard source for these measures, shelf settings can also provide detailed records. However, the implementation of shelf data for these purposes has been hindered by the perception that local environmental conditions (such as freshwater influx) confound regional and global signals. Here, we directly evaluate this concern by assessing the spatial variability in the isotopic composition of biogenic carbonate precipitated along the depositional strike of an inner shelf environment. Data are derived from mollusc shells collected from a stratigraphically restricted, transgressive unit in the early Eocene ({\~{}}55Ma) of the US Gulf Coastal Plain (GCP). Lithofacies and fossil assemblages suggest that an estuary was present in the westernmost study region, whereas more typically marine facies predominated elsewhere. Isotopic composition varies predictably with paleoenvironmental setting; shells from the estuary have $\delta$ 18O values and 87Sr/ 86Sr ratios that reflect high freshwater input. Specimens in the eastern GCP, however, from within and between outcrops separated by up to 400km, all yield similar results. Serial microsampling reveals congruence not only in mean $\delta$ 18O values, but also in winter and summer extremes. Estimated paleotemperatures (mean annual temperature of 26°C) agree well with proxy and model evidence for the early Eocene and the GCP, and 87Sr/ 86Sr ratios are consistent with the established early Eocene seawater ratio. The fidelity of isotopic values relative to environment indicates that shallow shelf records have much to contribute to studies of ancient climate and ocean chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The use of stable isotopes to solve biogeochemical problems in ecosystem analysis is increasing rapidly because stable isotope data can contribute both source-sink (tracer) and process information. The elements C, N, S, H, and 0 all have more than one isotope, and isotopic compositions of natural materials can be measured with great precision with a mass spectrometer. Isotopic compositions change in predictable ways as elements cycle through the biosphere. These changes have been exploited by geochemists to understand the global elemental cycles. Ecologists have not until quite recently employed these techniques. The reasons for this are, first, that most ecologists do not have the background in chemistry and geochemistry to be fully aware of the possibilities for exploiting the natural variations in stable isotopic composi- tions, and second, that stable isotope ratio measurements require equipment not normally available to ecologists. This is unfortunate because some of the more intractable problems in ecology can be profitably addressed using stable isotope measurements. Stable isotopes are ideally suited to increase our understanding of element cycles in ecosystems. This review is written for ecologists who would like to learn more about how stable isotope analyses have been and can be used in ecosystem studies. We begin with an explanation of isotope terminology and fractionation, then summarize isotopic distributions in the C, N, and S biogeochemical cycles, and conclude with five case studies that show how stable isotope measure- ments can provide crucial information for ecosystem analysis. We restrict this review to studies of natural variations in C, N, and S isotopic abundances, excluding from consideration '5N enrichment studies and hydrogen and oxy- gen isotope studies. Our focus on C, N, and S derives in part from our experience that combinations of these measurements are often complementary and in part from the need to limit the scope of the review.},

abstract = {An Inceptisol A-horizon from Hawaii was subjected to a series of reduction-oxidation cycles - 14 d cycle length over a 56 d duration - across the "soil-Fe" [Fe(OH)3.Fe2+(aq), log Ko = 15.74] equilibrium in triplicate redox-stat reactors. Each reducing event simulated the flush of organic C and diminished O2 that accompanies a rainfall-induced leaching of bioavailable reductants from the forest floor into mineral soil. The soil contained considerable amounts of short-range ordered (SRO) minerals (e.g., nano-goethite and allophane) and organic matter (11{\%} org-C). Room temperature and cryogenic 57Fe M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopy showed that the iron-bearing minerals were dominated by nano- to micro-scale goethite, and that ferrihydrite was not present. Over the four full cycles, fluctuations in Eh (from 200 to 700 mV) and pFe2+ (from 2.5 to 5.5) were inversely correlated with those of pH (5.5 to 4). Here, we focus on the solubility dynamics of the framework elements (Si, Fe, Ti, and Al) that constitute 35{\%} of the oxygen-free soil dry mass. Intra-cycle oscillations in dissolved ({\textless}3 kDa) metals peaked during the reduction half-cycles. Similar intra-cycle oscillations were observed in the HCl and acid ammonium oxalate (AAO) extractable pools. The cumulative response of soil solids during multiple redox oscillations included: (1) a decrease in most HCl and AAO extractable metals and (2) a transformation of SRO Fe (as nano-goethite) to micro-crystalline goethite and micro-crystalline hematite. This may be the first direct demonstration that Fe oxide crystallinity increases during redox oscillations - an a priori unexpected result. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Previous geochemical and microbiological studies in the Cariaco Basin indicate intense elemental cycling and a dynamic microbial loop near the oxic-anoxic interface. We obtained detailed distributions of sulfur isotopes of total dissolved sulfide and sulfate as part of the on-going CARIACO time series project to explore the critical pathways at the level of individual sulfur species. Isotopic patterns of sulfate (??34SSO4) and sulfide (??34SH2S) were similar to trends observed in the Black Sea water column: ??34SH2S and ??34SSO4 were constant in the deep anoxic water (varying within 0.6??? for sulfide and 0.3??? for sulfate), with sulfide roughly 54??? depleted in 34S relative to sulfate. Near the oxic-anoxic interface, however, the ??34SH2S value was {\~{}}3??? heavier than that in the deep water, which may reflect sulfide oxidation and/or a change in fractionation during in situ sulfide production through sulfate reduction (SR) ??34SH2S and ??33SH2S data near the oxic-anoxic interface did not provide unequivocal evidence to support the important role of sulfur-intermediate disproportionation suggested by previous studies. Repeated observation of minimum ??34SSO4 values near the interface suggests 'readdition' of 34S-depleted sulfate during sulfide oxidation. A slight increase in ??34SSO4 values with depth extended over the water column may indicate a reservoir effect associated with removal of 34S-depleted sulfur during sulfide production through SR. Our ??34SH2S and ??33SH2S data also do not show a clear role for sulfur-intermediate disproportionation in the deep anoxic water column. We interpret the large difference in ??34S between sulfate and sulfide as reflecting fractionations during SR in the Cariaco deep waters that are larger than those generally observed in culturing studies. ?? 2010.},

abstract = {Microbial activity has been invoked to explain anomalous oxygen isotope compositions of phosphate mineral deposits as well as fossil biogenic apatite. Results of laboratory experiments on enzyme-mediated reactions of phosphate and microbially mediated degradation of organic matter, an important mechanism for the regeneration of dissolved phosphate in modern porewaters, demonstrate that significant exchange of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water accompanies the hydrolytic cleavage of organically bound phosphate as well as the metabolism of inorganic orthophosphate. Evaluation of the oxygen isotope systematics of microbially mediated reactions of phosphate suggests that oxygen isotope exchange between phosphate and water mediated by bacteria is governed by equilibrium rather than kinetic factors. Under certain conditions, the microbially mediated exchange appears to result in complete re-equilibration of oxygen isotopes between phosphate and water and in other instances equilibrium exchange may be masked by inheritance of phosphate-oxygen from the organic substrate. Analogous microbial processes in natural sediments may be important in; the release of dissolved phosphate to pore fluids, precipitation of authigenic apatite, and in the diagenetic alteration of phosphorite deposits and biogenic apatite. These results have important implications for paleoclimatological and paleoenvironmental studies in which oxygen isotope ratios of biogenic phosphate are used as paleotemperature indicators, as well as for studies employing phosphate oxygen isotopes as a tracer of P transport and cycling in the environment.

abstract = {The late Triassic period is recognized as one of the five major mass extinctions in the fossil record. All these important intervals in earth history are associated with excursions in C-isotope records thought to have been caused by perturbations in the global carbon cycle. The nature and causes of C-isotopic events across the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) transition however, are poorly understood. We present several new high resolution organic C-isotope records from the Eiberg Basin, Austria, including the proposed Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Jurassic. The Triassic-Jurassic boundary interval in these records is characterized by the initial and main negative organic carbon isotope excursions (CIE) of up to 8‰. The initial and main CIEs are biostratigraphically constrained by first and last occurrences of boundary defining macro- and microfossils (e.g. ammonites). High resolution C-isotope records appear to be an excellent correlation proxy for this period in the Eiberg Basin. Pyrolysis analysis demonstrates increased Hydrogen Index (HI) values for organic matter coinciding with the initial CIE. Terrestrial organic matter influx and mass occurrences of green algae remains may have influenced the C-isotope composition of the sedimentary organic matter. This may have contributed to the extreme amplitude of the initial CIE in the Eiberg Basin. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Reservoir zonation can lead to an insight about the lateral and vertical distribution of reservoir and non-reservoir zones from bore hole to regional scales. Based on available data sets, scale of study and purposes, there are various reservoir zonation schemes, but correlatability is crucial in any reservoir zonation procedure. In this study, it is attempted to create a reservoir zonation scheme based on geological attributes in the Permo-Triassic successions of the eastern Persian Gulf area, which can be used to inter-field (regional) investigation and correlation. Then, the applicability of two routinely used reservoir zonation procedures including hydraulic flow units (HFU) and flow units based on a stratigraphic modified Lorenz plot was examined. The petrophysical based HFUs were not correlatable between the studied wells and fields. The larger scale flow units were correlatable at the field and to some extent inter-field scales. But, the identified geological reservoir zones (GRZs) were correlatable at both intra- and inter-field scales in a sequence stratigraphic framework. GRZs were defined based on sharp changes in depositional facies, diagenetic features or both and also any meaningful accompaniment in diagenetic features and pore types, which show similar sequence stratigraphic positions. This indicates a close relationship between the depositional sequences and post-depositional diagenetic processes, and therefore GRZs are linked to a sequence stratigraphic framework. The GRZ concept may be applicable to reservoir characterization of the Permo-Triassic successions in the Persian Gulf and adjacent areas. However, this concept can only be applied if the combined depo-diagenetic processes and the resulting reservoir quality are controlled by sequence stratigraphic position without pervasive and non-facies related late diagenetic overprints.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction was the most severe in the Phanerozoic, extinguishing more than 90{\%} of marine and 75{\%} of terrestrial species in a maximum of 61 ± 48 ky. Because of broad temporal coincidence between the biotic crisis and one of the most voluminous continental volcanic eruptions since the origin of animals, the Siberian Traps large igneous province (LIP), a causal connection has long been suggested. Magmatism is hypothesized to have caused rapid injection of massive amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, driving climate change and subsequent destabilization of the biosphere. Establishing a causal connection between magmatism and mass extinction is critically dependent on accurately and precisely knowing the relative timing of the two events and the flux of magma. New U/Pb dates on Siberian Traps LIP lava flows, sills, and explosively erupted rocks indicate that (i) about two-thirds of the total lava/pyroclastic volume was erupted over {\~{}}300 ky, before and concurrent with the end-Permian mass extinction; (ii) eruption of the balance of lavas continued for at least 500 ky after extinction cessation; and (iii) massive emplacement of sills into the shallow crust began concomitant with the mass extinction and continued for at least 500 ky into the early Triassic. This age model is consistent with Siberian Traps LIP magmatism as a trigger for the end-Permian mass extinction and suggests a role for magmatism in suppression of post-extinction biotic recovery.},

abstract = {The {\$}\delta{\$}13C and {\$}\delta{\$}18O records of Permian fossil brachiopods with biostratigraphical age control from southeastern Australia have been constructed to investigate the high latitude paleoenvironment of Gondwanaland. All samples were thin sectioned and examined using petrographic and cathodoluminescence microscopy for evaluating shell preservation. Elemental compositions of select brachiopod shells were measured using electron probe microanalysis to further evaluate shell preservation. Within these intervals the average {\$}\delta{\$}13C values of the best preserved (non-luminescent; NL) portion of the brachiopod shells are all greater than +5.1‰ with the highest value, +7.0‰, at Lower Wandrawandian Siltstone (late Kungurian). These carbon isotope values are similar to those of contemporaneous tropical eastern Pangea (Russian Platform) but heavier than those of western Pangea (North America).The oxygen isotope difference between brachiopods of high southern latitudes and low latitudes fluctuated during Early to Middle Permian. The mean {\$}\delta{\$}18O values of the high-latitude NL brachiopod shells were more positive than those of the low latitudes in early Sakmarian (-0.3‰), early Late Artinskian (-1.1‰), late Kungurian (-1.0‰), Roadian (-0.2‰), and Wordian (-0.7‰); comparable to those of tropical western Pangea in early Artinskian (-2.1‰) and early Kungurian (-2.5‰); and more negative than those of tropical western Pangea in late Late Artinskian (-3.9‰). Assuming the oxygen isotope value for Permian seawater in southeast Australia was -1‰, the calculated oxygen isotope temperatures were mostly between 12°C and 16°C reflecting southeast Australia's cool high latitude temperature conditions. Higher apparent oxygen isotope temperatures for the Upper Pebbly Beach Formation (29°C, late Late Artinskian), Berriedale Limestone (21°C, early Artinskian), and Snapper Point Formation (22°C, early Kungurian) may be attributed to a combination of warmer climate and lower seawater {\$}\delta{\$}18O in this region. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study examines the morphological responses of Late Permian brachiopods to environmental changes. Quantitative analysis of body size data from Permian-Triassic brachiopods has demonstrated significant, directional changes in body size before, during and after the Late Permian mass extinction event. Brachiopod size significantly reduced before and during the extinction interval, increased for a short time in more extinction-resistant taxa in the latter stages of extinction and then dramatically reduced again across the Permian/Triassic boundary. Relative abundances of trace elements and acritarchs demonstrate that the body size reductions which happened before, during and after extinction were driven by primary productivity collapse, whereas declining oxygen levels had less effect. An episode of size increase in two of the more extinction-resistant brachiopod species is unrelated to environmental change and possibly was the result of reduced interspecific competition for resources following the extinction of competitors. Based on the results of this study, predictions can be made for the possible responses of modern benthos to present-day environmental changes.},

abstract = {Precipitation of inorganic calcium carbonate is a common occurrence in both modern and ancient marine environments. However, synsedimentary growth of large ({\textgreater}5-10 cm) crystalline carbonate cements directly onto the sea floor has been thought to be limited to the Proterozoic, when seawaters were highly oversaturated with calcium carbonate compared to average Phanerozoic values. Outer shelf to slope deposits of the Lower Triassic Union Wash Formation in east-central California, deposited in oxygen-restricted settings, contain crystalline calcium carbonate cements that appear to have grown directly on the sea floor. Paleoenvironmental analyses indicate that these large calcium carbonate cements grew under conditions that were similar to those proposed for the precipitation of inorganic calcite in the Black Sea. Sulfate reduction of organic matter led to an increase in the amount of bicarbonate ion in deep waters and a concomitant increase in Sigma CO 2 and alkalinity. Mixing with surface waters led to CO 2 degassing, and precipitation of cements from waters supersaturated with calcium carbonate. The presence of these cements and associated facies thus provides evidence of harsh environmental conditions in the Early Triassic at the regional level, which may have acted in concert with biotic effects of the end-Permian mass extinction, as well as similar deleterious conditions (e.g., shelf anoxia) in other regions, to produce a prolonged as well as temporally and geographically variable biotic recovery from this mass extinction.},

They often coincide with rapid changes in the stable carbon isotope ratios (13C/12C) recorded in sedimentary carbonate and organic matter, ratios which can indicate substantial inputs to the surface carbon reservoirs and/or changes in the cycling of carbon. Models to explain these changes have provided much fuel for debate on the causes and consequences of mass extinctions. For example, the escape of methane from gas hydrate deposits or the emission of huge volumes of gaseous carbon from large-scale volcanic systems, known as large igneous provinces, may have been responsible for decreases of 13C/12C in sedimentary deposits. In this article, we discuss the challenges in distinguishing between these, and other, alternatives.},

abstract = {We measured in situ photosynthesis of benthic microbial mats at various depths in Lake Hoare, a permanently ice-covered lake of the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica, using oxygen (02) microelectrodes. We further investigated the vertical distribution and activity of pigments in the microbial mats using an imaging pulse-amplitude-modulated fluorometer. Microbial mats to at least 16.6-m water depth are net producers Of 02 during the summer period. Net 02 production ranges from 100-500 mu mol m(-2) h(-1) at incident downwelling irradiances of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) of 1.0-4.6 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1). Photosynthesis of mat-forming cyanobacteria and diatoms occurs at all lake depths at or close to maximum efficiency. We measured absorption by the pigment arrays at a single water depth and, by assuming that absorption is water-depth invariant, we estimated an area-specific maximum community quantum yield of 0.073 mol carbon per mol photons. A community compensation irradiance of 0.1 mu mol quanta m(-2) s(-1) was estimated, reflecting extreme shade acclimation. These results confirm estimates previously derived from laboratory gas-exchange measurements and imply that even minor changes in the intensity of the incident downwelling irradiance of PAR caused by, for example, changes in the transparency of the ice cover or the optical properties of the water column can significantly alter rates of benthic carbon fixation. In situ measurements were confined to mats with flat surfaces. Laboratory measurements at the surface of mats with pinnacled surfaces revealed a complex small-scale chemical structure at the mat-water interface.},

abstract = {A numerical model was applied to investigate and to quantify biogeochemical processes and methane turnover in gas hydrate-bearing surface sediments from a cold vent site situated at Hydrate Ridge, an accretionary structure located in the Cascadia Margin subduction zone. Steady state simulations were carried out to obtain a comprehensive overview on the activity in these sediments which are covered with bacterial mats and are affected by strong fluid flow from below. The model results underline the dominance of advective fluid flow that forces a large inflow of methane from below (869 $\mu$mol cm-2 a-1) inducing high oxidation rates in the surface layers. Anaerobic methane oxidation is the major process, proceeding at a depth-integrated rate of 870 $\mu$mol cm-2 a-1. A significant fraction (14{\%}) of bicarbonate produced by anaerobic methane oxidation is removed from the fluids by precipitation of authigenic aragonite and calcite. The total rate of carbonate precipitation (120 $\mu$mol cm-2 a-1) allows for the build-up of a massive carbonate layer with a thickness of 1 m over a period of 20,000 years. Aragonite is the major carbonate mineral formed by anaerobic methane oxidation if the flow velocity of methane-charge fluids is high enough (≥ 10 cm a-1) to maintain super-saturation with respect to this highly soluble carbonate phase. It precipitates much faster within the studied surface sediments than previously observed in abiotic laboratory experiments, suggesting microbial catalysis. The investigated station is characterized by high carbon and oxygen turnover rates (≈ 1000 $\mu$mol cm-2 a-1) that are well beyond the rates observed at other continental slope sites not affected by fluid venting. This underlines the strong impact of fluid venting on the benthic system, even though the flow velocity of 10 cm a-1 derived by the model is relative low compared to fluid flow rates found at other cold vent sites. Non-steady state simulations using measured fluid flow velocities as forcing demonstrate a rapid respond of the sediments within a few days to changes in advective flow. Moreover, they reveal that efficient methane oxidation in these sediments prevents methane outflow into the bottom water over a wide range of fluid flow velocities ({\textless}80 cm a-1). Only at flow rates exceeding approximately 100 cm a-1, does dissolved methane break through the sediment surface to induce large fluxes of up to 5000 $\mu$mol CH4 cm2 a-1 into the overlying bottom water. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.},

Although there is now sufficient geochemical evidence to exactly locate the "hot spots" of AOM, and to crudely estimate its contribution to the methane cycle, a fundamental understanding of the associated biology is still lacking, consequently preventing a thorough biogeochemical understanding of an integral process in the global carbon cycle. Earlier microbiological work trying to resolve the enigma of AOM mostly failed because it was largely focussed on the simulation of AOM under laboratory conditions using cultivable candidate organisms. Now again, understanding the biological and biochemical details of AOM is the declared goal of several international research groups, but this time in a combined effort of biogeochemists and microbiologists using novel analytical tools tailored for the study of unknown microbes and habitats. This review gives an overview on very recent progress in the study of AOM that dramatically advanced this {\~{}} 30-yr-old field.

The main constituents of the EPS extracted by all methods were proteins and carbohydrates, as confirmed by FT-IR analysis, showing the major presence of carboxylic, hydroxylic and amino groups.

abstract = {The Cretaceous period ({\~{}}145–65 m.y. ago) was characterized by intervals of enhanced organic carbon burial associated with increased primary production under greenhouse conditions. The global consequences of these perturbations, oceanic anoxic events (OAEs), lasted up to 1 m.y., but short-term nutrient and climatic controls on widespread anoxia are poorly understood. Here, we present a high-resolution reconstruction of oceanic redox and nutrient cycling as recorded in subtropical shelf sediments from Tarfaya, Morocco, spanning the initiation of OAE2. Iron-sulfur systematics and biomarker evidence demonstrate previously undescribed redox cyclicity on orbital time scales, from sulfidic to anoxic ferruginous (Fe-rich) water-column conditions. Bulk geochemical data and sulfur isotope modeling suggest that ferruginous conditions were not a consequence of nutrient or sulfate limitation, despite overall low sulfate concentrations in the proto–North Atlantic. Instead, fluctuations in the weathering influxes of sulfur and reactive iron, linked to a dynamic hydrological cycle, likely drove the redox cyclicity. Despite the potential for elevated phosphorus burial in association with Fe oxides under ferruginous conditions on the Tarfaya shelf, porewater sulfide generation drove extensive phosphorus recycling back to the water column, thus maintaining widespread open-ocean anoxia.},

abstract = {Offsets from isotopic equilibrium in biogenic carbonates have complicated paleoclimate reconstructions for decades. A new archive of climate, deep-sea corals, is used to evaluate the calcification processes, independent of photosynthesis, that contribute to these offsets. Carbon and oxygen stable isotope data from six modern deep-sea corals show strong linear trends between $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O. Slopes of these trends between samples are similar and range between 1.9 to 2.6 for $\Delta$$\delta$13C/$\Delta$ $\delta$18O. Linear trends intersect isotopic equilibrium for $\delta$18O and are slightly depleted for $\delta$13C. Variations in the isotopic ratios are strongly correlated with the density banding structure. Isotopically depleted aragonite is associated with light, quickly precipitating bands, whereas isotopically enriched points correspond to slowly accumulating, less dense aragonite. The densest white band at the trabecular center is furthest from isotopic equilibrium for both carbon and oxygen. Data from this region fall off the linear trend between $\delta$18O and $\delta$13C. This deviation, where $\delta$13C remains constant while the $\delta$18O continues to decrease, does not support "vital effect" mechanisms that call upon kinetic fractionation to explain offsets from isotopic equilibrium. We propose a new mechanism for vital effects in these deep-sea corals that is based on a thermodynamic response to a biologically induced pH gradient in the calcifying region. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Patterns of taxonomic and ecologic selectivity are the most direct record of processes influencing survival during background and mass extinctions. The Guadalupian (Capitanian) and end-Permian (Changhsingian) extinctions have both been linked to environmental degradation from eruption of large flood basalts; however, the extent to which taxonomic selectivity conforms to the expected stresses remains incompletely understood because many of the relevant biological traits are mutually correlated. Here we use a large occurrence-based database to quantify extinction selectivity during background and mass extinction intervals from the Kungurian (latest Early Permian) to Changhsingian. Our multiple logistic regression analysis confirms that the end-Permian extinction was a physiological crisis, selecting against genera with poorly buffered respiratory physiology and calcareous shells. Genera with unbuffered physiology also fared poorly in the Guadalupian extinction, consistent with recognition of a pronounced crisis only among protists and reef-builders and implying similar respiratory physiological stresses. Despite sharing a similar trigger, the end-Permian extinction was considerably more severe than the Guadalupian or other Phanerozoic physiological crises. Its magnitude may have resulted from a larger environmental perturbation, although the combination of warming, hypercapnia, ocean acidification, and hypoxia during the end-Permian extinction likely exacerbated the crisis because of the multiplicative effects of those stresses. Although ocean carbon cycle and evolutionary changes have reduced the sensitivity of modern ecosystems to physiological stresses, extant marine invertebrates face the same synergistic effects of multiple stressors that were so severe during the end-Permian extinction.},

abstract = {Geochemical proxies based on Fe abundance (Fe/Al) and Fe-speciation have been widely applied to marine sediments in order to unravel paleo-depositional redox conditions though geological time. To date, however, these Fe proxies have only been calibrated in relation to modern and ancient fine-grained siliciclastic marine sediments. This clearly limits their use, particularly in relation to carbonate-rich sediments and rocks. To address this, we here explore the applicability of Fe-based redox proxies in carbonates through three approaches. First, we have compiled Fe/Al data for modern marine sediments to investigate variability in Fe-enrichments as a function of carbonate content and depositional setting. Second, we have expanded this approach with a compilation of new and existing Fe-speciation data for modern and ancient marine sediments deposited under oxic and euxinic (anoxic sulfidic) water column conditions. Finally, we show new data from paired limestone and dolomite sample sets to demonstrate the potential significance of deep burial dolomitization on the Fe-speciation redox proxy. Modern marine sediments deposited under oxic conditions show no relationship between Fe/Al and carbonate content. These sediments have an average Fe/Al ratio of 0.55±0.11, with some higher values potentially being attributable to steady-state early diagenetic remobilization of Fe towards the sediment-water interface. In contrast, significant Fe/Al enrichments occur as a consequence of water column Fe mineral formation and deposition, either under anoxic conditions, or due to input of anoxic hydrothermal fluids into oxic seawater. Iron speciation data also show no direct correlation with carbonate content, and instead three groups can be distinguished based on total Fe (FeT) and organic C contents. Sediments deposited under oxic water column conditions, with FeT {\textgreater}0.5wt.{\%}, generally plot below the lower FeHR/FeT siliciclastic reference threshold (0.38) for distinguishing anoxic environments, regardless of carbonate content. Also consistent with siliciclastic calibrations, carbonate-rich sediments deposited under anoxic water column conditions tend to have FeHR/FeT ratios {\textgreater}0.38. In contrast, oxic carbonate-rich sediments with low FeT ({\textless}0.5wt.{\%}) and low organic C ({\textless}0.5wt.{\%}) routinely give spuriously high FeHR/FeT ratios, suggesting that the use of Fe-speciation for such samples is not appropriate for evaluating water column redox conditions. Taken together, our data suggest that an FeT content of {\textgreater}0.5wt.{\%}, rather than carbonate content, represents the most suitable basis for identifying whether carbonate-rich sediments are appropriate for Fe-based redox proxy analyses. Analysis of burial dolostones suggests that the Fe-speciation proxy may also be compromised by deep burial dolomitization, where there has been a source of mobile Fe to enrich rocks during recrystallization. However, pre-screening can identify such samples. This new assessment expands the utility of Fe-based redox proxies to also incorporate appropriate carbonate-rich rocks, provided that care is taken to assess the possible impact of deep burial dolomitization. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A study of latest Permian and Early Triassic multielement conodonts identifies eight steps in their evolutionary history during an interval when Earth's biosphere was highly stressed. These steps are: 1) gradual decline of families and genera through the Changhsingian (up to the late Griesbachian); 2) conodont biofacies change and extinction of Tethyan endemic species close to the Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB); 3) faunal turnover with extinction and origination in the late Griesbachian; 4) initial radiation in gondolellids and diversification in apparatuses during the Dienerian; 5) explosive radiation in the early-middle Smithian; 6) major extinction in the late Smithian; 7) major radiation early in the Spathian; 8) gradual turnover and decline in the late Spathian through early Anisian. Conodontophorids were reduced from five families at the beginning of the Changhsingian to three by the PTB, and to two late in the Griesbachian. From the Changhsingian to the late Griesbachian, there was a single multielement apparatus represented in the Gondolellidae, whereas by the Olenekian there were at least twelve. Given absolute age constraints, the conodont recovery in the aftermath of the PTB was extraordinary. Conodont evolution during the Dienerian remains obscure but was very significant in terms of changes in multielement apparatuses. In spite of Induan extinctions, generic diversity generally increased from the PTB up to the late Smithian. In terms of species, genera, and multielement apparatuses, the acme of Triassic conodonts was in the middle Smithian, and the biggest extinction was in the late Smithian. After this extinction, generic and apparatus diversity quickly returned to high levels, marking a significant Spathian recovery. Gradual decline characterized the late Spathian and persisted into the early Anisian. A synthetic summary of the temporal distribution and proposed relationships amongst all known Lower Triassic conodonts provide an improved foundation for biostratigraphic and biochronologic studies. Extinction and radiation trends correlate well with sea-level changes and sequence boundaries: faunal turnovers correspond to lowstands in the late Griesbachian, late Smithian, and late Spathian, and radiations correspond to transgressions in the early Griesbachian, early Smithian, and early Spathian. The trends also correlate with perturbations in the carbon cycle, with Lower Triassic [delta]13C minima corresponding to extinction and faunal turnover, and positive values generally occurring during radiations. However, Middle Triassic recovery of marine benthos follows a positive maxima and an overall decline in conodont diversity. New taxa Borinella chowadensis, B. megacuspa, Neogondolella griesbachensis, and N. mongeri are described.},

To infer the monsoon-driven {\textordfeminine}moisture history{\textordmasculine} in the northeastern Arabian Sea during the past 5000 years, we have used three types of independant proxies: (1) varve thickness, (2) stable isotope ratios of planktic foraminifera; and (3) inorganic geochemical composition. On the basis of these proxies we have subdivided the sedimentary record into {\textregistered}ve intervals. The {\textregistered}rst time interval from 5000 to 3900 yr BP (Period I) is dominated by summermonsoon activity. Deduced from Ti/Al, Zr/Al, K/Al and Sr/Ca ratios and oxygen-isotope data of planktonic foraminifera slightly enhanced winter-monsoon conditions can be inferred for the period from 3900 to about 3000 yr BP (Period II). Maximum precipitation during enhanced winter-monsoon activity at about 3100 yr BP was followed by an onset of aridi{\textregistered}cation at 3000 yr BP which continued until about 2000±2200 yr BP (Period III). The textural, mineralogical and geochemical data suggest that this aridi{\textregistered}cation was a gradual, century-scale process rather than an abrupt event. Comparison to late Holocene records in NW- and SW-India, the Near East and tropical Africa supports our interpretation that Period III from 3000 to 2000 yr BP is characterized by a gradual change in the atmospherical moisture budget over much of this area. Reduced monsoonal rainfall may be linked to variations of Eurasian snow cover. As deduced from varve thickness and element to Al-ratios, Period IV from 2000 to about 1500 yr BP is characterized by a summer-monsoon dominated sequence with higher precipitation than during Period III. The d 18O record shows an abrupt shift at 2000 yr BP coinciding with an increase of varve thickness which suggests a cooling of surface waters in the northern Arabian Sea. Present-day conditions in the Makran area were established at 1500 yr BP (Period V). Based on inorganic geochemical data and meteorological records at several stations in the Makran we conclude that Period V is dominated by precipitation during the winter season. Here, declined rainfall associated with the summer-monsoon may be related to a less northward position of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) during summer and a stronger in¯uence of winter-monsoon linked phenomenona.},

Here, we present a framework for analyses of how chemical energy availability shape chemotrophic microbial communities in hydrothermal systems through an investigation of two geochemically different basalt-hosted hydrothermal systems on the Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge: the Soria Moria Vent field (SMVF) and the Loki/'s Castle Vent Field (LCVF). Chemical energy landscapes were evaluated through modelling of the Gibbs energy from selected redox reactions under different mixing ratios between seawater and hydrothermal fluids. Our models indicate that the sediment-influenced LCVF has a much higher potential for both anaerobic and aerobic methane oxidation, as well as aerobic ammonium and hydrogen oxidation, than the SMVF. The modelled energy landscapes were used to develop microbial community composition models, which were compared with community compositions in environmental samples inside or on the exterior of hydrothermal chimneys, as assessed by pyrosequencing of partial 16S rRNA genes. We show that modelled microbial communities based solely on thermodynamic considerations can have a high predictive power and provide a framework for analyses of the link between energy availability and microbial community composition.},

abstract = {The occurrence of microbialites in post-glacial coral reefs has been interpreted to reflect an ecosystem response to environmental change. The greater thickness of microbialites in reefs with a volcanic hinterland compared to thinner microbial crusts in reefs with a non-volcanic hinterland led to the suggestion that fertilization of the reefal environment by chemical weathering of volcanic rocks stimulated primary productivity and microbialite formation. Using a molecular and isotopic approach on reef-microbialites from Tahiti (Pacific Ocean), it was recently shown that sulfate-reducing bacteria favored the formation of microbial carbonates. To test if similar mechanisms induced microbialite formation in other reefs as well, the Tahitian microbialites are compared with similar microbialites from coral reefs off Vanuatu (Pacific Ocean), Belize (Caribbean Sea, Atlantic Ocean), and the Maldives (Indian Ocean) in this study. The selected study sites cover a wide range of geological settings, reflecting variable input and composition of detritus. The new lipid biomarker data and stable sulfur isotope results confirm that sulfate-reducing bacteria played an intrinsic role in the precipitation of microbial carbonate at all study sites, irrespective of the geological setting. Abundant biomarkers indicative of sulfate reducers include a variety of terminally-branched and mid chain-branched fatty acids as well as mono-O-alkyl glycerol ethers. Isotope evidence for bacterial sulfate reduction is represented by low $\delta$ 34S values of pyrite (-43 to -42‰) enclosed in the microbialites and, compared to seawater sulfate, slightly elevated $\delta$ 34S and $\delta$ 18O values of carbonate-associated sulfate (21.9 to 22.2‰ and 11.3 to 12.4‰, respectively). Microbialite formation took place in anoxic micro-environments, which presumably developed through the fertilization of the reef environment and the resultant accumulation of organic matter including bacterial extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), coral mucus, and marine snow in cavities within the coral framework. ToF-SIMS analysis reveals that the dark layers of laminated microbialites are enriched in carbohydrates, which are common constituents of EPS and coral mucus. These results support the hypothesis that bacterial degradation of EPS and coral mucus within microbial mats favored carbonate precipitation. Because reefal microbialites formed by similar processes in very different geological settings, this comparative study suggests that a volcanic hinterland is not required for microbialite growth. Yet, detrital input derived from the weathering of volcanic rocks appears to be a natural fertilizer, being conductive for the growth of microbial mats, which fosters the development of particularly abundant and thick microbial crusts. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The middle of the Cretaceous (120–80 Ma) was one of the warmest periods of the past 300 m.y., with tropical sea-surface temperatures well over 30 °C (Puc{\'{e}}at et al., 2007; Forster et al., 2007a) and atmospheric CO2 levels much higher than today. Therefore this period can give us crucial information on the mechanisms governing the climatic system in a context of extreme greenhouse conditions. Within this interval, major perturbations of the carbon cycle occurred around the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (93.5 Ma), evidenced by worldwide deposition of organic-rich (black) shales in the oceans, and a large positive carbon isotope excursion reflecting enhanced burial of 13C-depleted organic carbon. Such episodes of extensive organic-matter burial are known as oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) and are thought to have an impact on global climate through atmospheric CO2 draw-down (Forster et al., 2007b). Both increased primary productivity leading to higher fluxes of organic carbon to the seafloor, and better preservation of organic matter due to anoxic conditions have been invoked to explain enhanced organic-matter burial (Arthur et al., 1990). Although sluggish ocean circulation is often called upon to explain widespread ocean anoxia, we actually know very little about the global circulation system during the Cretaceous. Apart from numerical simulations, few studies treat paleocirculation, and existing data on ocean structure remain very scarce for this period (Barrera et al., 1997; Puc{\'{e}}at et al., 2005; Soudry et al., 2006). In this issue of Geology, MacLeod et al. (p. 811–814) present new paleoceanographic data based on neodymium isotopes for the Late Cretaceous period, and they track circulation changes in the southern North Atlantic across the oceanic anoxic event of the Cenomanian-Turonian (OAE2), one of the most prominent OAEs.},

abstract = {The Guadalupian-Lopingian (G-L) boundary (260.4Ma) is one of the major extinction events in Earth history that coincides with the Emeishan Large Igneous Province and palaeoclimatic changes. Carbon isotopes of whole rock samples were studied in order to document changes in the global carbon cycle. In contrast to earlier studies, we observe no major negative excursion in $\delta$13C in the middle Capitanian. A positive $\delta$13C excursion is observed in the latest Capitanian with a 1.5{\%} increase registered in the J. xuanhanensis Zone to C. postbitteri hongshuiensis Subzone, followed by a decrease of 1{\%} within the C. postbitteri postbitteri Subzone and a 2{\%} decrease in the C. dukouensis to C. asymmetrica Zone. Oxygen isotopes of conodonts from two G-L boundary sections were measured in order to reconstruct conodont habitat and potential changes in water temperature. Oxygen isotope ratios of gondolellid conodonts are higher in comparison to oxygen isotope ratios measured on hindeodid conodonts suggesting that gondollelids lived in cooler and thus deeper waters compared with hindeodids. The oxygen isotope record reconstructed from gondollelid conodonts suggests warming of water temperatures of about 4°C in the late Capitanian (J. postserrata to J. granti Zone), cooling of about 6 to 8°C across the G-L boundary and in the earliest Wuchiapingian, and again significant warming in the Wuchiapingian (C. dukouensis to C. liangshanensis Zone). The temperature increase can be correlated with the main phase of Emeishan volcanism suggesting that climatic warming may have resulted in an intensified hydrological cycle, fertilisation of the oceans and enhanced primary productivity, the latter documented in the positive late Capitanian carbon isotope excursion. However, changes in sea-level seem to parallel reconstructed water temperatures suggesting that changes in water depth in combination with superimposed climatic changes may be responsible for the observed temperature changes. This study documents that oxygen isotope studies on Permian conodonts should be performed on mono-generic conodont samples and that oxygen isotopes not only provide valuable palaeoclimatic information but also may help to constrain the life habitat of conodonts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, we report on biomarker abundances through parts of the Permian/Triassic boundary (PTB) of Schuchert Dal (East Greenland) that contains rich marine faunal records and excellent terrestrial palynological records. Biomarker abundances and sulfur isotopes are used to correlate the series of events (including changes in element cycling and associated redox conditions of the ocean) surrounding the collapse of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems through this record of a major crisis of life on Earth during a mass extinction episode. The Upper Schuchert Dal Formation contains a low diversity palynological assemblage, ascribed to arborescent cordiaite-conifer-pteridosperm vegetation. Samples from this pre-collapse interval are characterised by high abundances of dibenzofuran (DBF), dibenzothiophene (DBT) and biphenyl. Since these compounds have similar base structures, and show comparable abundance curves, it is plausible that they probably derive from a common source. We propose that phenolic compounds of lignin of the woody plants present during this period could be the source for DBF, DBT and biphenyl. The redox conditions during this period of time also support the formation of DBF and DBT. Just above the extinction interval, there is a dramatic decrease in the abundances of DBF and DBT which occurs at the same time as a sudden change in the stable sulfur isotopic composition ($\delta$34S) of pyrite, indicating a change in redox conditions from oxic to anoxic/euxinic conditions. $\delta$34S values leading up to the extinction are highly depleted in the heavy sulfur isotope (about - 40‰ vs. VCDT), whilst shortly after the extinction interval much more positive isotope values are observed (about - 25‰). An inferred change in the biogeochemical sulfur cycle is supported by facies evidence from similar neighbouring sections. It is suggested that two processes are operating closely here; 1) Changes in redox conditions and 2) extinction and/or transgression accounting for the absence of woody material. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

The system passed the following tests: (a) the temperatures deduced from isotopic analyses of the sequence of fish from Lake Baikal are in good agreement with the temperatures measured in the thermally stratified lake; (b) the isotopic composition of fish bone phosphate is not influenced by the isotopic composition of the phosphate which is fed to the fish, but only by temperature and water composition.

abstract = {The inner shelf off west coast of India, is covered with late Holocene to recent organic rich, silty-clay dominant sediments. High TOC content and sedimentation rates result in high sulfate reduction rates in this region (Mazumdar et al., 2009). In the present study, we have investigated the nature of pyrite and C-Fe-S geochemistry in a sediment core (covering the last 378years) at a water depth of 17m off Goa, west coast, India, to understand the diagenetic and palaeoclimatic/oceanographic processes. The chromium reducible sulfur (CRS) and highly reactive iron (Fe HR) profiles show significant fluctuations and a negative correlation with ?? 34S CRS, which is attributed to relative availability of highly reactive and less reactive iron bearing minerals close to the sediment water interface. Low ?? 34S CRS corresponding to high CRS content characterizes early diagenetic pyritization near the sediment-water interface, whereas high ?? 34S CRS and low CRS content indicate late diagenetic pyritization of less reactive iron during burial. High OBS/CRS ratios suggest the important role played by the labile organic compound in binding sulfur in the sediment. Partitioning of stable sulfur isotopes into organic and iron bound phases is apparently linked to Fe HR and labile organic matter availability. We have proposed Fe HR profile and Fe HR/Fe T ratios as a potential tool to understand runoff/monsoonal fluctuations in a shallow marine depositional setting. To develop this tool into a potential paleoclimatic/oceanographic proxy and to link it to other proxies within a chronological framework, needs high resolution sampling and age dating. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {About 75{\%} of extant sponge species use dissolved silicon (DSi) to build a siliceous skeleton. We show that silicon (Si) uptake by sublittoral Axinella demosponges follows an enzymatic kinetics. Interestingly, maximum uptake efficiency occurs at experimental DSi concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sponge habitats, being unachievable in coastal waters of modern oceans. Such uptake performance appears to be rooted in a former condition suitable to operate at the seemingly high DSi values characterizing the pre-Tertiary ({\textgreater}65 mya) habitats where this sponge lineage diversified. Persistence of ancestral uptake systems causes sponges to be outcompeted by the more efficient uptake of diatoms at the low ambient DSi levels characterizing Recent oceans. Yet, we show that sublittoral sponges consume substantial coastal DSi (0.01-0.90 mmol Si m(-2) day(-1)) at the expenses of the primary-production circuit. Neglect of that consumption hampers accurate understanding of Si cycling on continental margins.},

abstract = {Sedimentary molybdenum, [Mo]s, has been widely used as a proxy for benthic redox potential owing to its generally strong enrichment in organic-rich marine facies deposited under oxygen-depleted conditions. A detailed analysis of [Mo]s{\&}{\#}8211;total organic carbon (TOC) covariation in modern anoxic marine environments and its relationship to ambient water chemistry suggests that (1) [Mo]s, while useful in distinguishing oxic from anoxic facies, is not related in a simple manner to dissolved sulfide concentrations within euxinic environments and (2) patterns of [Mo]s-TOC covariation can provide information about paleohydrographic conditions, especially the degree of restriction of the subchemoclinal water mass and temporal changes thereof related to deepwater renewal. These inferences are based on data from four anoxic silled basins (the Black Sea, Framvaren Fjord, Cariaco Basin, and Saanich Inlet) and one upwelling zone (the Namibian Shelf), representing a spectrum of aqueous chemical conditions related to water mass restriction. In the silled-basin environments, increasing restriction is correlated with a systematic decrease in [Mo]s/TOC ratios, from {\&}{\#}8764;45 ± 5 for Saanich Inlet to {\&}{\#}8764;4.5 ± 1 for the Black Sea. This variation reflects control of [Mo]s by [Mo]aq, which becomes depleted in stagnant basins through removal to the sediment without adequate resupply by deepwater renewal (the {\&}{\#}8220;basin reservoir effect{\&}{\#}8221;). The temporal dynamics of this process are revealed by high-resolution chemostratigraphic data from Framvaren Fjord and Cariaco Basin sediment cores, which exhibit long-term trends toward lower [Mo]s/TOC ratios following development of water column stratification and deepwater anoxia. Mo burial fluxes peak in weakly sulfidic environments such as Saanich Inlet (owing to a combination of greater [Mo]aq availability and enhanced Mo transport to the sediment-water interface via Fe-Mn redox cycling) and are lower in strongly sulfidic environments such as the Black Sea and Framvaren Fjord. These observations demonstrate that, at timescales associated with deepwater renewal in anoxic silled basins, decreased sedimentary Mo concentrations and burial fluxes are associated with lower benthic redox potentials (i.e., more sulfidic conditions). These conclusions apply only to anoxic marine environments exhibiting some degree of water mass restriction (e.g., silled basins) and are not valid for low-oxygen facies in open marine settings such as continent-margin upwelling systems.},

We have compared $\delta$Dkerogen with $\delta$13C of kerogen ($\delta$13Ckerogen) and $\delta$34S of total reduced inorganic sulfur (TRIS, essentially pyrite; $\delta$34Spyrite) of all the sections and for one sample set with $\delta$13C of carbonate ($\delta$13Ccarbonate) to establish (i) similarities between the sections and (ii) evaluate whether these signals are local and/or global. Stable isotope shifts occur for all three sample sets either at the P–Tr transition (Western Australia) or coinciding with the marine ecosystem collapse (Spitsbergen and East Greenland). $\delta$Dkerogen reflects organic matter (OM)/ kerogen type and is not sensitive to the low level of thermal maturation. Reliable palaeoenvironmental information in terms of the use of $\delta$D can therefore only be obtained for the P–Tr transition from hydrogen compound-specific isotope analyses (CSIA) of biomarkers (Nabbefeld et al., 2010b). The negative shifts in $\delta$13Ccarbonate (primary) and $\delta$13Ckerogen are attributed to the release of 13C-depleted carbon into the atmosphere, whereas the isotopic excursions in $\delta$34Spyrite relate to palaeoredox changes. However, the global coincidence in timing of the shifts in $\delta$Dkerogen, $\delta$34Spyrite and $\delta$13Ckerogen suggests a relation between the sulfur, carbon and hydrogen cycles. The negative shifts in $\delta$13Ccarbonate (primary) are in general attributed to the release of 13C-depleted source of carbon into the oceans and atmosphere, whereas $\delta$13Ckerogen can reflect the latter in certain cases, but can also be superimposed by varying sources of OM/kerogen type. Isotopic excursions in $\delta$34Spyrite relate to global changes in the palaeoredox conditions that affect sulfur cycling in the ancient seas.},

abstract = {The concentrations of total carbonate (Ct), sulphate, sulphide, thiols and oxygen, the ratio between the stable sulphur isotopes 34S and 32S in sulphate and sulphide, and the density (used to calculate salinity) were determined on samples from the water column of Framvaren, a superanoxic fjord in southern Norway. From a depth of 18m (the oxic-anoxic boundary) the initial sulphate concentration, ([SO4]init), as calculated from salinity, is significantly higher than the sum of the measured sulphur species. This is attributed to a loss of sulphur from the water column. The amount of total carbonate produced, corrected for the initial concentration (Ct - 2.4 Sal/35) is found to be proportional to the amount of sulphate consumed, ([SO4]init - [SO4]), according to the following relation Ct - 2.4 Sal/35 = 1.84 ([SO4]init - [SO4]). Isotopic fractionation caused by bacterial sulphate reduction in the anoxic part of the water column produces sulphide with a $\delta$34S ∼ 40‰ lower than the $\delta$34S for sulphate at corresponding depths. The isotopic fractionation also results in $\delta$34S value for the remaining sulphate at depths below 80 m being considerably higher than the mean value for ocean water, which is close to + 20‰. The $\delta$34S values for sulphate at depths between 10 and 50 m were lower than + 20‰ which indicates oxidation of sulphide, which follows upon diffusion of sulphide from deeper parts of the water column and inflow of oxygenated seawater over the sill into the anoxic water of the fjord. A conclusive scenario of the Framvaren sulphur chemistry is presented.},

abstract = {Transient pore-water and solid-phase signatures in deep subseafloor marine sediments, resulting from changes in both the amount and the quality of the organic matter input, are common but often difficult to interpret. We combined high-resolution pore-water and solid-phase data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 323 Site U1341 (Bowers Ridge, Bering Sea) with inverse reaction-transport modeling to examine the evolution and potential preservation of diagenetic signals in these deep subseafloor sediments. We explore how these signals reflect major changes in the deposition and reactivity of organic matter to the seafloor at Bowers Ridge. Results of the inverse model approach reveal that 2.51-2.58. Ma ago a high deposition flux of extremely labile organic matter, probably linked to increased surface water primary productivity, affected this site. Associated elevated organoclastic sulfate reduction rates facilitated low sulfate concentrations, the onset of methanogenesis, and consequently sulfate reduction coupled to the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Sulfate depletion caused the dissolution of biogenic barite reflected by a sedimentary interval with low Ba/Al ratios. Two sulfate-methane transition zones (SMTZs) evolved where high rates of AOM controlled sulfate consumption which was sustained by the influx of sulfate from seawater above and a deep source below. The positions of both SMTZs shifted non-synchronously over the subsequent ∼130,000. yrs, until methanogenesis and AOM declined. The present-day sulfate concentration and sulfur isotope profiles still reflect the impact of the reactive organic matter pulse. They also record a period of very low reactive organic matter deposition during the middle to late Pleistocene, probably linked to very low primary productivity, resulting in little microbial carbon turnover in the sediment. Our study shows that combining biogeochemical signatures recorded in the solid-phase of deep subseafloor sediments with the analysis of transient pore-water signals by inverse reaction-transport modeling yields new insights into past deep biosphere processes and the paleoproductivity of marine basins. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Natural variations of 238U/235U in marine CaCO3 rocks are being explored as a novel paleoredox proxy to investigate oceanic anoxia events. Although it is generally assumed that U isotopes in CaCO3 directly record 238U/235U of seawater, recently published laboratory experiments demonstrate slight U isotope fractionation during U(VI) incorporation into abiotic calcium carbonates. This fractionation is hypothesized to depend on aqueous U(VI) speciation, which is controlled by pH, ionic strength, pCO2 and Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations. Secular variation in seawater chemistry could lead to changes in aqueous U(VI) speciation, and thus, may affect the extent of U isotope fractionation during U(VI) incorporation into CaCO3. In this study, we combine estimates of seawater composition over the Phanerozoic with a model of aqueous U speciation and isotope fractionation to explore variations in the expected offset between the U isotope composition of seawater and primary marine CaCO3 through time. We find that U isotope fractionation between U in primary marine CaCO3 and seawater could have varied between 0.11 and 0.23‰ over the Phanerozoic due to secular variations in seawater chemistry. Such variations would significantly impact estimates of the extent of marine anoxia derived from the U isotope record. For example, at the Permo-Triassic boundary, this effect might imply that the estimated extent of anoxia is ∼32{\%} more extreme than previously inferred. One significant limitation of our model is that the existing experimental database covers only abiotic carbonate precipitation, and does not include a possible range of biological effects which might enhance or suppress the range of isotopic fractionation calculated here. As biotic carbonates dominate the marine carbonate record, more work is need to assess controls on U isotopic fractionation into biotic marine carbonates.},

abstract = {Deoxygenation is a global problem in coastal and open regions of the ocean, and has led to expanding areas of oxygen minimum zones and coastal hypoxia. The recent expansion of hypoxia in coastal ecosystems has been primarily attributed to global warming and enhanced nutrient input from land and atmosphere. The largest anthropogenically induced hypoxic area in the world is the Baltic Sea, where the relative importance of physical forcing versus eutrophication is still debated. We have analyzed water column oxygen and salinity profiles to reconstruct oxygen and stratifica-tion conditions over the last 115 y and compare the influence of both climate and anthropogenic forcing on hypoxia. We report a 10-fold increase of hypoxia in the Baltic Sea and show that this is primarily linked to increased inputs of nutrients from land, although increased respiration from higher temperatures during the last two decades has contributed to worsening oxygen conditions. Although shifts in climate and physical circulation are important factors modulating the extent of hypoxia, further nutrient reductions in the Baltic Sea will be necessary to reduce the ecosystems impacts of deoxygenation. biogeochemistry | climate change},

@article{Heimdal2018,
abstract = {The end-Triassic is characterized by one of the largest mass extinctions in the Phanerozoic, coinciding with major carbon cycle perturbations and global warming. It has been suggested that the environmental crisis is linked to widespread sill intrusions during magmatism associated with the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP). Sub-volcanic sills are abundant in two of the largest onshore sedimentary basins in Brazil, the Amazonas and Solim{\~{o}}es basins, where they comprise up to 20{\%} of the stratigraphy. These basins contain extensive deposits of carbonate and evaporite, in addition to organic-rich shales and major hydrocarbon reservoirs. Here we show that large scale volatile generation followed sill emplacement in these lithologies. Thermal modeling demonstrates that contact metamorphism in the two basins could have generated 88,000 Gt CO 2 . In order to constrain the timing of gas generation, zircon from two sills has been dated by the U-Pb CA-ID-TIMS method, resulting in 206 Pb/ 238 U dates of 201.477 ± 0.062 Ma and 201.470 ± 0.089 Ma. Our findings demonstrate synchronicity between the intrusive phase and the end-Triassic mass extinction, and provide a quantified degassing scenario for one of the most dramatic time periods in the history of Earth. The end-Triassic extinction (ETE) is one of the largest mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. Both marine and terres-trial ecosystems were severely affected, and evidence from the fossil record indicates a total species loss of as much as 80{\%} 1 . The ETE is associated with a 3–6‰ negative carbon isotope excursion (CIE) recorded in both marine and terrestrial records 2–6 , and by global warming of up to 3-4 °C (ref. 7). Previous studies have temporally linked the ETE to the onset of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP 8), leading to the hypothesis that CAMP vol-canism triggered the end-Triassic crisis 4–6,8–11 . However, in all available stratigraphic sections, preserved lava flows post-date the ETE-marking CIE 4–6,12 , making this link questionable. Furthermore, carbon cycle models show that the magnitude of CO 2 release from the CAMP lavas is not sufficient to explain the 3–6‰ negative CIE considering a mantle $\delta$ 13 C value of {\~{}}−5‰, and that a more 12 C-enriched carbon source was potentially involved 1,13,14 . A recent study 15 used high precision U-Pb geochronology to demonstrate that the sub-volcanic phase of CAMP started 150 ± 38 ky before the oldest basalt flows, and showed that the emplacement of igneous intrusions in Brazil, Spain and Bolivia occurred synchronously with the ETE (201.564 ± 0.015 Ma 11). This is significant as a large portion of the CAMP is preserved as sills 16 , which are particularly widespread in northern Brazil 17–22 . These sills are emplaced in the Amazonas and Solim{\~{o}}es basins (and likely also in the Acre Basin 17) and are estimated to {\~{}}5 × 10 5 km 3 , which represents ca. 75{\%} of the total volume of known CAMP sills 16 . The Amazonas and Solim{\~{o}}es basins comprise a thick sedimentary sequence (up to 5 km thick 18), including organic-rich shales, carbonates and evaporites 18–20 . Contact metamorphism and/or assimilation of host rock related to sill emplacement can lead to significant sediment-derived volatile generation if the host rocks are rich in organic matter and/or evaporites 23 . A causal link between the generation of isotopically light carbon from contact metamorphism and negative CIEs has been proposed for other global events such as the end-Guadalupian, end-Permian, end-Toarcian, and the Paleocene-Eocene 24–29 . The generated gases in the Brazilian basins could have included SO 2 , halogens, halocar-bons and/or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and it has been speculated that these gases were involved},

The only fauna consists of occasional bedding plane assemblages of Lingula or Claraia, a typical lower dysaerobic assemblage. This is a level where previous studies have shown a major negative carbon isotope excursion and a cerium anomaly. In the Dolomites, the pyritic micrite directly overlies strata containing a diverse and typically Permian marine fauna of algae, foraminifers (including fusulinids) and articulate brachiopods, implying an abrupt extinction in contradiction to many previous views. Sequence stratigraphic analysis of the Dolomite boundary sediments reveals a minor sequence boundary in the late Permian followed by extremely rapid transgression leading to the development of the relatively deep water pyritic micrite - a maximum flooding surface at the Permo-Triassic boundary. A further pulsed deepening in the lower Griesbachian, recorded in both the Dolomites and Idaho, lead to the widespread establishment of dysaerobic facies. It is clear that most of the extinctions occurred at the erathem boundary although the subsequent failure of the marine benthos to fill the empty ecospace in the ensuing Griesbachian may have been due to the widespread development of dysaerobic conditions.},

abstract = {The primary mineralogy of oolites and early marine carbonate cements led Sandberg [Nature 305 (1983), 19-22] to divide the Phanerozoic Eon into three intervals of 'aragonite seas' and two intervals of 'calcite seas'. Hardie [Geology 24 (1996), 279-283] has shown that these oscillations, together with synchronous oscillations in the mineralogy of marine potash evaporites, can be explained by secular shifts in the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater driven by changes in spreading rates along mid-ocean ridges. The Hardie model also predicts that high-Mg calcite should precipitate along with aragonite, as it does in today's aragonite sea. We have uncovered oscillations in the carbonate mineralogy of hypercalcifying organisms (ones that have produced massive skeletons, large reefs, or voluminous bodies of sediment) that correspond to Sandberg's aragonite seas and calcite seas and that are predicted by the Hardie model. Particular groups of corals, sponges, and algae appear to have been dominant reef builders only when favored by an appropriate Mg/Ca ratio in seawater. In early and middle Paleozoic calcite seas (Calcite I), reefs were dominated by calcitic tabulate, heliolitid, and rugose corals and calcitic stromatoporoids. In contrast, during the period of late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic aragonite seas (Aragonite II), aragonitic groups of sponges, scleractinian corals, and phylloid algae, as well as high-Mg calcitic red algae, were principal reef builders. During Late Cretaceous time, at the acme of Calcite II, massive rudists displaced aragonitic hermatypic corals. In today's aragonite sea (Aragonite III) scleractinian corals are again dominant reef builders, along with high-Mg calcitic coralline algae. Major sediment-producing algae exhibit temporal patterns similar to those of reef builders. Calcitic receptaculitids flourished during Calcite I, whereas aragonitic dasycladaceans did not become dominant rock formers until Aragonite II. During Calcite II, calcitic nannoplankton formed massive coccolith chalks in warm shallow seas of the Late Cretaceous, after the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater had reached a very low value and calcium concentration, a very high value. As the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater rose and calcium concentration fell during the Cenozoic Era, individual coccoliths, on average, became less massive and encrusted cells less thickly. By Pliocene time, during Aragonite III, the prominent genus Discoaster secreted only narrow-rayed coccoliths that covered less than 25{\%} of the cell surface. Also during Aragonite III, the aragonitic green alga Halimeda emerged as the dominant skeletal sediment producer in reef tracts. The influence of seawater chemistry on skeletal secretion appears to have been especially strong for morphologically simple taxa that exert relatively weak control over their own calcification. Such groups include algae, sponges, corals, and bryozoans. Morphological simplicity also permits these groups to adopt vegetative or colonial modes of growth that confer success in competition for space on reefs. This linkage, in addition to the basic chemical demands of hypercalcification, has given the Mg/Ca ratio of seawater strong control over the success of individual reef-building taxa. More generally, this ratio appears to have strongly influenced evolutionary changes in the skeletal mineralogy of sponges and cheilostome bryozoans throughout their history. We conclude that throughout Phanerozoic time a chain of causation has extended from mid-ocean ridge processes, via seawater chemistry, to the mineralogical and biological composition of reef communities and bioclastic carbonate deposits.},

abstract = {Many aspects of Earth's early sulfur cycle, from the origin of mass-anomalous fractionations to the degree of biological participation, remain poorly understood--in part due to complications from postdepositional diagenetic and metamorphic processes. Using a combination of scanning high-resolution magnetic superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscopy and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) of sulfur isotopes ((32)S, (33)S, and (34)S), we examined drill core samples from slope and basinal environments adjacent to a major Late Archean (∼2.6-2.5 Ga) marine carbonate platform from South Africa. Coupled with petrography, these techniques can untangle the complex history of mineralization in samples containing diverse sulfur-bearing phases. We focused on pyrite nodules, precipitated in shallow sediments. These textures record systematic spatial differences in both mass-dependent and mass-anomalous sulfur-isotopic composition over length scales of even a few hundred microns. Petrography and magnetic imaging demonstrate that mass-anomalous fractionations were acquired before burial and compaction, but also show evidence of postdepositional alteration 500 million y after deposition. Using magnetic imaging to screen for primary phases, we observed large spatial gradients in $\Delta$(33)S ({\textgreater}4‰) in nodules, pointing to substantial environmental heterogeneity and dynamic mixing of sulfur pools on geologically rapid timescales. In other nodules, large systematic radial $\delta$(34)S gradients ({\textgreater}20‰) were observed, from low values near their centers increasing to high values near their rims. These fractionations support hypotheses that microbial sulfate reduction was an important metabolism in organic-rich Archean environments--even in an Archean ocean basin dominated by iron chemistry.},

abstract = {Significant problems have arisen in the past with dating and correlating stratigraphical sequences impoverished in or barren of fossil remains, leaving major questions in stratigraphy for periods dominated by nonmarine formations. These problems are exacerbated in dating and correlating barren sequences encountered in offshore exploration and appraisal drilling where the potential of alternative techniques becomes economically extremely important. Brought together in this volume is a wide range of diverse techniques and disciplines, broadly grouped into mineralogical, chemical, isotopic, luminescence and cyclicity analyses, to explore their potential in solving difficulties in stratigraphy. The intention is also to introduce these techniques, already familiar to specialist researchers, to a wider audience of petroleum geologists who may find them useful in resolving their specific correlation problems. The book will be of particular interest to hydrocarbon exploration and production geologists.},

abstract = {The structures of both ikaite (CaCO3{\textperiodcentered}6H2O) and monohydrocalcite (CaCO3{\textperiodcentered}H2O) were computed at the PBE0 level of theory, using all electron Gaussian type basis sets. Correction for the long-range dispersion contribution was included for the oxygen-oxygen interactions by using an additive pairwise term with the atomic coefficients fitted against the calcite vs aragonite enthalpy difference. The potential chirality of monohydrocalcite is discussed, as well as the helical motifs created by the three-fold rototranslational axes parallel to the [001] direction. These elements represent a significant link between monohydrocalcite and vaterite, both appearing as intermediate species during CaCO3crystallization from amorphous calcium carbonate. The hydrogen bond pattern, never fully discussed for monohydrocalcite, is here described and compared to the available experimental data. Both phases are characterized by the presence of hydrogen bonds of moderate to high strength. Water molecules in monohydrocalcite interact quite strongly with 2 CO32- units through such hydrogen bonds, whereas their interaction with each other is minor. On the contrary, water molecules in ikaite create a complex network of hydrogen bonds, where each water molecule is strongly hydrogen bonded to one CO32- anion and to one or two other water molecules.},

Evaluation of more than 7400 skeletonized benthic invertebrates and taphonomic processes reveal a general pattern of increasing diversity and abundances of skeletozoans through the Early Triassic in tropical marine environments on the coast of western Pangea (present-day western U.S.A.). Griesbachian age skeletobiont assemblages are dominated by episkeletozoans, while Spathian ones are dominated by endoskeletozoans. Bivalves were the primary hard substrate for the skeletozoans in all examined strata, most likely because they were the most abundant skeletonized benthic invertebrate. Microconchids are hypothesized to have behaved opportunistically during the immediate aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction, and they had a strongly preferred association with Claraia. This and future studies of Early Triassic skeletobionts will contribute to further understanding arguably one of the most evolutionary significant intervals in Earth's history. ?? 2010.},

Experimental evidence suggests that coral calcification decreases as aragonite saturation drops but increases as temperatures rise toward thresholds optimal for coral growth. In situ studies have documented alarming recent declines in calcification rates on several tropical coral reef ecosystems. We show there is no widespread pattern of consistent decline in calcification rates of massive Porites during the 20th century on reefs spanning an 11° latitudinal range in the southeast Indian Ocean off Western Australia. Increasing calcification rates on the high-latitude reefs contrast with the downward trajectory reported for corals on Australia's Great Barrier Reef and provide additional evidence that recent changes in coral calcification are responses to temperature rather than ocean acidification.},

abstract = {A negative shift in marine inorganic carbon-isotope composition ([delta]13Ccarb) during the end-Permian mass extinction has been used as evidence for several different extinction mechanisms. Changes to the [delta]13C of organic matter and the difference between it and [delta]13Ccarb ([Delta]13C = [delta]13Ccarb - [delta]13Corg) have been examined at few locations, with conflicting interpretations. We examine the changes to both organic and inorganic carbon isotopes across the Permian-Triassic boundary at two marine sections from South China (Meishan and Shangsi) and compare these to data from other previously published sections. Through these analyses, we demonstrate that a decrease in [Delta]13C occurred during the extinction event throughout the Paleo-Tethys ocean. The extent and intensity of the decrease varies by location averaging a negative shift of {\~{}} 5[per mille sign]. Several possibilities as to the cause of this shift exist including Siberian trap volcanism, a change in the terrestrial/marine organic carbon input to the system, or a change in the dominant marine biota brought about through environmental changes (such as widespread ocean anoxia/euxinia). The decrease in [Delta]13C observed at many of these sections across the event horizon is here interpreted to represent a shift from algae/cyanobacteria to less fractionating phototrophic sulfur bacteria in marine shelf environments resulting from upward excursions of the chemocline. These chemocline upward excursions would release euxinic water to the photic zone allowing phototrophic sulfur bacteria to thrive. The limited available biomarker data are consistent with this interpretation.},

abstract = {Carcasses of the shrimp Crangon crangon were incubated in a marine medium under oxic conditions at 15??C which was inoculated with a consortium of sulfate-reducing, sulfide-oxidizing, and fermentative bacteria. These standard conditions were varied by adding sediment, omitting sulfate, adding glucose, omitting the inoculum, adding phosphate, and enhancing the buffer capacity. The chemical gradients generated by decay were monitored over a period of 29 days with O2, pH- and sulfide-microelectrodes. In most of the experiments oxygen was depleted, pH decreased and sulfide accumulated around the carcass within a week, creating steep chemical gradients, and decay was predominantly anaerobic. By 29 days maximum change in O2 concentration was from around 200 to 0 ??M, in pH from 7.5 to 6.2 and in sulphide concentration from 0 to 5.6 mM. Although weight loss and general decay were least when only indigenous bacteria were present, only CaCO3 crystal bundles formed and there was no soft tissue preservation. In contrast, where decay and weight loss were more extensive anaerobic sulphate reduction was intense. pH decreased markedly, and some muscle tissue was replicated in CaPO4. The pH close to the decaying carcass seemed to determine whether CaCO3 or CaPO4 formed. Paradoxically, the exceptional preservation of soft-tissues in fossils requires elevated rather than restricted microbial activity as this leads to anaerobically driven authigenic mineral formation.},

abstract = {Acidification of a solid sample to separate inorganic carbon (IC) from organic carbon (OC) is a widely encountered procedure in limnology and oceanography. Traditionally, OC was isolated to determine the weight-{\%} of OC ({\%}OC), but it is becoming increasingly common to determine the isotopic signatures of the OC (d13COC  and D14COC). This raises a need for a closer scrutiny of the currently used acidification methods. First, because IC and OC typically have distinct carbon-isotopic signatures, d13COC  and D14COC values can be compromised if IC is not completely removed. Second, it is possible to isotopically fractionate a sample if a small portion of OC is lost during acidification, because OC itself is both chemically and isotopically heterogeneous. This study evaluated two acidification methods by HCl{\~{A}}¢{\^{a}}‚¬{\^{a}}€ in the vaporous (HClvap) and aqueous (HClaq) phases{\~{A}}¢{\^{a}}‚¬{\^{a}}€ to determine {\%}OC, d13COC, and D14COC in coastal sediments. Each method was assessed according to the criteria that it (1) has low blank levels, (2) is able to remove dolomite, (3) yields accurate {\%}OC, and (4) yields accurate d13COC  and D14COC values. HClvap  fulfilled all criteria, given that the samples were not overexposed to acid. Overexposure led to underestimation of d13COC  and D14COC values. HClaq  gave similar results but was less reliable in that it consistently underestimated {\%}OC and yielded inaccurate d13COC  value for one test sample. It is recommended that an optimal acid exposure is carefully determined for each sample type to obtain most accurate d13COC and D14COC values. },

Here, we present the results of nanoscale studies of the 2,724- Myr-old stromatolites from the Tumbiana Formation (Fortescue Group, Australia) showing organic globule clusters within the thin layers of the stromatolites. Aragonite nanocrystals are also closely associated with the organic globules, a combination that is remarkably similar to the organo-mineral building blocks of modern stromatolites(3-5). Our results support microbial mediation for the formation of the Tumbiana stromatolites, and extend the geologic record of primary aragonite by more than 2,300Myr ( ref. 6).},

abstract = {Live specimens of benthic foraminifera have been analyzed from surface sediment samples collected from 108 to 1134 m depth in the Southern California Borderland. The temperature and isotopic composition of the ambient water and dissolved inorganic carbon have also been measured to permit comparison of foraminiferal compositions to expected equilibrium values. The species analyzed break down into four groups which reflect the influence of mineralogy (aragonite vs. calcite), biological fractionation ("vital effect"), and microhabitat effects on isotopic composition. The aragonitic Hoeglundina elegans show an enrichment in 18O relative to equilibrium calcite of 0.41{\%}0 in shallower water increasing to at least 1.06{\%}0 in deeper water. The 13C enrichment of H. elegans relative to the dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is also depth dependent, increasing from 1.27{\%}0 at 108 m to 2.13{\%}0 at 940 m. This depth dependence results from the change in composition of the DIC; the 13C composition of H. elegans remains constant with depth for some unknown reason. One possible explanation is that the change in composition of the DIC is balanced by an increase in Hoeglundina-HCO-3 fractionation with decreased temperature. The $\delta$13C values of the Cassidulina species are almost identical to those of the ambient dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and reflect the decrease in the $\delta$13C of the DIC with depth. The $\delta$13C values of species not in 18O equilibrium vary independently of the changing composition of the DIC. There is a correlation between $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O among coeval species, consistent with the model which explains vital effect as the result of incorporation of isotopically light metabolic CO2 into the shell. The magnitude of disequilibrium is relatively constant for 18O but not for 13C, suggesting that in isotopic stratigraphy studies, it may be difficult to "calibrate" the $\delta$13C of different species as has been done with $\delta$18O. There appears to be a relationship between taxonomic group and vital effect. The foraminifera in approximate 18O equilibrium with the water, including species of Cassidulina, Bolivina, Uvigerina, and Globobulimina, are members of the family Cassidulinidae or superfamily Buliminacea. Those not in 18O equilibrium, including species of Pyrgo, Quinqueloculina, Triloculina, and Lenticulina, belong to the families Miliolidae and Vaginulinidae. No disequilibrium species have been found as yet in the low oxygen environments of the borderland. This observation and published findings on the ultrastructure of benthic foraminifera suggest that isotopic "behavior" may be related to a foraminifer's ability to exchange gases rapidly with its ambient water. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {Observational and modeling studies relevant to climate change on tectonic time scales are reviewed. Probably the most significant climate result from this time scale involves inferences about nearly ice-free conditions for some intervals of earth history. Some additional results suggest relatively rapid transitions between climate states. Modeling studies indicate that although tectonic changes significantly modify the atmosphere and ocean circulation, in most cases such modifications do not appear to be sufficient to explain ice-free climates. Increased atmospheric CO2 levels (5-10 × present values?) may be needed to completely reconcile models and data. Although the CO2 paradigm has received widespread attention in the last few years, the results summarized herein indicate that CO2 is only one of several important factors influencing climate. I believe the time is appropriate for contemplating climate change on tectonic time scales in terms of a "post-CO2 synthesis," in which direct tectonic factors are approximately equal in importance to CO2 fluctuations. In the last few years, modeling studies have progressed from a state of virtually no work on the topic to one where the models are in some respect ahead of the observations, in the sense that data have not been compiled to test even some of the most basic model predictions. In particular, information is needed on past atmospheric CO2 levels, tropical sea-surface temperatures, seasonality of continental interiors, and locations and production rates of deep-waters. Initial steps are being taken to integrate observational and modeling activities on tectonic time scales, and some of these shortcomings may be rectified over the next few years. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction event coincides with a dramatic negative shift in both the $\delta$13C and the $\delta$18O isotope record, at or near the extinction horizon, from multiple marine and terrestrial sections round the globe. This study has identified the isotope excursions in a shallow water, carbonate-dominated, section at Val Brutta in the Southern Alps. High resolution bulk rock sampling revealed that there is an average $\delta$13Ccarb negative shift of - 4‰ and a $\delta$18Ocarb shift of - 6‰. This is similar to the isotope record at other nearby localities. This section, like many others, shows a degree of recrystallisation which hampers absolute palaeotemperature calculations. However, some brachiopod fossils, including specimens of Comelicania and Janiceps, found within the beds that contain the bulk rock anomaly, appear to be remarkably well preserved and still retain their internal structure and the primary isotopic variation across the shell. As such, they have been successfully analysed and the data used to produce a palaeotemperature estimate, at the time of the isotope anomaly, of between 26 and 29 °C for latest Permian. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Two lithological units within the$\backslash$ntransitional section are distinguished: the Lower-Middle Rhaetian$\backslash$nWielichowo Beds of alluvial plain facies, which shows evidence of a$\backslash$nsemi-arid climate, and the Upper Rhaetian to Lower Hettangian Zagaje$\backslash$nFormation, lying above a marked erosional sequence boundary, composed of$\backslash$nmudstone-claystone and sandstone deposited in a fluvial-lacustrine$\backslash$nenvironment. Carbon isotope values obtained from palynomaceral$\backslash$nseparates, and thus reflecting isotopic changes in atmospheric CO2, show$\backslash$nsignificant fluctuations through the Rhaetian; the most conspicuous$\backslash$nnegative delta C-13(org) excursion is correlated with the Rhaetian$\backslash$n`initial' excursion and shows two sub-peaks, pointing to short-term$\backslash$ncarbon-cycle disturbances of lesser magnitude. Above the `initial'$\backslash$nnegative excursion, there is a positive excursion followed again by more$\backslash$nnegative values, representing subordinate fluctuation within a positive$\backslash$nexcursion and is correlated with the T-J boundary. Seventy-two miospore$\backslash$ntaxa have been determined from the studied T-J transitional section. Two$\backslash$nmajor palynological assemblages have been distinguished: the lower one,$\backslash$ntypically Rhaetian, named the Cingulizonates rhaeticus-Limbosporites$\backslash$nlundblandii association, which corresponds to the$\backslash$nRhaetipollis-Ricciisporites (= Rhaetipollis-Limbosporites) Zone; and the$\backslash$nupper one, typically Hettangian, named the Conbaculatisporites$\backslash$nmesozoicus-Dictyophyllidites mortoni-Cerebropollenites thiergartii$\backslash$nassociation (with the age-diagnostic pollen C. thiergartii), which$\backslash$ncorresponds to the Pinuspollenites-Trachysporites (=$\backslash$nTrachysporites-Heliosporites) Zone. The T-J palynofloral turnover$\backslash$noccurred in a humid period and is more conspicuous then palynofloral$\backslash$nchanges observed in Greenland, the Tethyan domain or other parts of NE$\backslash$nEurope.

A series of periodical atmospheric loading by CO2, CH4 or$\backslash$nalternatively by SO2, sulphate aerosols and toxic compounds is inferred$\backslash$nto have caused a series of rapid climatic reversals, directly$\backslash$ninfluencing the ecosystem and causing the Triassic floral crisis.

abstract = {Abstract The shell of marine gastropods conserves and reflects early ontogeny, including embryonic and larval stages, to a high degree when compared with other marine invertebrates. Planktotrophic larval development is indicated by a small embryonic shell (size is also related to systematic placement) with little yolk followed by a multiwhorled shell formed by a free‐swimming veliger larva. Basal gastropod clades (e.g. Vetigastropoda) lack planktotrophic larval development. The great majority of Late Palaeozoic and Mesozoic ‘derived' marine gastropods (Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia) with known protoconch had planktotrophic larval development. Dimensions of internal moulds of protoconchs suggest that planktotrophic larval development was largely absent in the Cambrian and evolved at the Cambrian–Ordovician transition, mainly due to increasing benthic predation. The evolution of planktotrophic larval development offered advantages and opportunities such as more effective dispersal, enhanced gene flow between populations and prevention of inbreeding. Early gastropod larval shells were openly coiled and weakly sculptured. During the Mid‐ and Late Palaeozoic, modern tightly coiled larval shells (commonly with strong sculpture) evolved due to increasing predation pressure in the plankton. The presence of numerous Late Palaeozoic and Triassic gastropod species with planktotrophic larval development suggests sufficient primary production although direct evidence for phytoplankton is scarce in this period. Contrary to previous suggestions, it seems unlikely that the end‐Permian mass extinction selected against species with planktotrophic larval development. The molluscan classes with highest species diversity (Gastropoda and Bivalvia) are those which may have planktotrophic larval development. Extremely high diversity in such groups as Caenogastropoda or eulamellibranch bivalves is the result of high phylogenetic activity and is associated with the presence of planktotrophic veliger larvae in many members of these groups, although causality has not been shown yet. A new gastropod species and genus, Anachronistella peterwagneri, is described from the Late Triassic Cassian Formation; it is the first known Triassic gastropod with an openly coiled larval shell.},

Organic matter-rich sediments deposited during these events are characterized by a N-15 content typical of newly fixed N-2, indicating that cyanobacterial N-2 fixation was the main source for nutrient N. We propose that denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation effectively cut off the return of nutrient N from the anoxic deep waters to the photic zone in the oceans, giving N-2-fixing cyanobacteria a competitive advantage over algae during these oceanic anoxic events.},

abstract = {Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) in marine sediments is an important microbial process in the global carbon cycle and in control of greenhouse gas emission. The responsible organisms supposedly reverse the reactions of methanogenesis, but cultures providing biochemical proof of this have not been isolated. Here we searched for AOM-associated cell components in microbial mats from anoxic methane seeps in the Black Sea. These mats catalyse AOM rather than carry out methanogenesis. We extracted a prominent nickel compound displaying the same absorption spectrum as the nickel cofactor F 430 of methyl-coenzyme M reductase, the terminal enzyme of methanogenesis; however, the nickel compound exhibited a higher molecular mass than F 430 . The apparent variant of F 430 was part of an abundant protein that was purified from the mat and that consists of three different subunits. Determined amino-terminal amino acid sequences matched a gene locus cloned from the mat. Sequence analyses revealed similarities to methyl-coenzyme M reductase from methanogenic archaea. The abun-dance of the nickel protein (7{\%} of extracted proteins) in the mat suggests an important role in AOM.},

abstract = {Box cores recovered during Leg 4 of the 1988 R/V "Knorr" Black Sea Oceanographic Expedition from deep-water regions of the basin were dominated by coccolith-rich, microlaminated (Unit 1) sediment and muddy, gray turbidite layers. Both organic carbon (OC) and pyrite sulfur values for Unit 1 display narrow ranges, with mean concentrations of 5.3 ± 1.1 (1$\sigma$) wt{\%} and 1.3 ± 0.3 wt{\%}, respectively. Unit 1 is not enriched in pyrite-S relative to sediments deposited under oxygenated bottom waters (normal marine sediments) with comparable OC concentrations. Carbon-sulfur relationships (evaluated on a calcium carbonate-free basis to avoid spurious correlations resulting from dilution effects) demonstrate that OC and pyrite-S are essentially decoupled. These observations, combined with the persistence of elevated pore-water sulfide to depth and a strong correlation between pyrite-S and the detrital Fe component argue strongly for limitation of pyrite formation in Unit 1 by the availability of reactive Fe. Unit-1 Fe limitation is further indicated by degree-of-pyritization (DOP) studies (a measure of the extent to which the original potentially reactive Fe has been transformed to pyrite). These studies show sulfidation of reactive Fe ranging from 57{\%} to 78{\%}, with DOP values independent of OC concentration. Unit-1 DOP profiles suggest that the majority of the pyrite is formed in the sulfidic water column and/or very close to the sediment-water interface. Pyrite-S concentrations of Unit 1, when compared with the particulate reduced sulfur fluxes measured in time-series sediment traps, are compatible with predominantly water-column pyrite formation. Because of the limitations in the supply of reactive Fe associated with the comparatively high supply of OC, the microlaminated sediment is characterized by C/S ratios greater than those typical of Holocene oxically deposited sediments. The turbidite muds of the deep basin display high reduced S values (relative to Holocene normal marine sediments) in samples with low OC concentrations (low C/S ratios). This reflects pyrite formation under anoxic-sulfidic bottom-water conditions in a probable upper-slope source region, as well as during transport and final deposition. Intermediate DOP values for the turbidites, in part a product of their rapid rate of deposition, reveal that Fe limitation is ultimately not a factor and that further pyrite should form during burial. However, the very rapid rate at which Unit-1 pyrite forms suggests fundamental differences between the overall reactivities of the Fe phases associated with the microlaminated and turbiditic sediments. The signature of water-column anoxia with regard to sedimentary pyrite formation is clearly indicated by the high DOP values of Unit 1 and the comparatively high levels of S associated with the low concentrations of OC of the turbidite muds. This agrees with similar conclusions based on studies of ancient sedimentary rocks. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {After three decades of research on the correlation between sea level and various proxies, there has been very little quantification of the first-order influence of sea level change on nutrient inventory, marine productivity, and burial of organic carbon. We present a model aimed at quantifying the burial of organic carbon as a function of sea level rise. The biogeochemical model explicitly considers the mean surface area distribution of the Earth as a function of elevation. Also included is dissolved inorganic phosphate (DIP) liberated from coastal sediments during transgression. We quantify how sea level rise of magnitudes inferred for the mid-Cretaceous influences the phosphorus cycle and burial of organic carbon. The burial efficiency is greater on the shelf. Therefore, in the model, the larger shelf area under high sea level results in more efficient burial of marine organic carbon for a given DIP concentration and associated new production of organic matter (NP). With a Late Cretaceous model shelf area the residence time of DIP decreases by 60{\%} relative to the present-day reference. Thus, in the final steady state, DIP and NP in the open ocean are reduced compared to today when the biologically reactive phosphorus (Preac) fluxes to the ocean from land are held constant. The lower new production reduces the oxygen demand for respiration and results in a significant oxygenation of the global ocean. Finally, the global organic carbon burial decreases by 30{\%} relative to today in the model. This decrease results from feedbacks between the flux of organic carbon to the seafloor and the ratio of organic carbon to Preac in buried sediments. In contrast, during sea level rise, coastal erosion may increase the Preac flux to the ocean by up to ∼20{\%} relative to today and cause a temporary increase in DIP concentration in the ocean. The resulting increase in organic carbon burial is equivalent to a carbon isotope event of +0.5 to 1‰. Larger carbon isotope events can be triggered by sea level rise only when the ocean is sufficiently close to anoxia in the oxygen minimum zone just prior to the sea level rise.},

abstract = {Early Triassic oceans were characterized by deposition of a number of "anachronistic facies", including microbialites, seafloor carbonate cement fans, and giant ooids. Giant ooids were particularly prevalent in Lower Triassic sections across South China and exhibit unusual features that may provide insights into marine environmental conditions following the end-Permian mass extinction. The section at Moyang (Guizhou Province) contains abundant giant ooids ranging in size between 2 and 6mm (maximum 12mm) and exhibiting various cortical structures, including regular, deformed, compound, regenerated and "domed". Preservation of ooid cortical structure is generally good as indicated by petrographic observations, and trace element and carbon isotope analyses suggest that diagenesis occurred in a closed diagenetic system. All ooids exhibit fine concentric laminae, frequently alternating between light-colored coarsely crystalline and dark-colored finely crystalline layers probably reflecting variation in organic content or original mineralogy. Under scanning electron microscope, biomineralized filaments or biofilms and tiny carbonate fluorapatite (CFA) crystals are commonly found in the finely crystalline layers. We infer that the precipitation of CFA was related to adsorption of P via microbial activity on the surfaces of ooids following episodic incursions of deep waters rich in CO2, H2S and phosphate into shallow-marine environments. Giant ooid precipitation may have been promoted in shallow ramp settings during these events by increased watermass agitation and supersaturation with respect to CaCO3, as well as reduced carbonate removal rates through biotic skeletal formation. Spatio-temporal distribution data reveal that giant ooids were widespread in the Tethyan region during the Early Triassic, and that they were most abundant immediately after the end-Permian crisis and disappeared gradually as metazoans repopulated marine environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested rapid evolution of conodonts across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB), and the end-Permian mass extinction pattern varies in different sections in South China. Here we document a high-resolution conodont succession from a carbonate facies of the Changhsingian Stage and across the PTB at the Daijiagou section, about 35km north to Chongqing City, Southwest China. Two genera and twelve species are identified. Seven conodont zones are recognized from the uppermost part of the Lungtan Formation to the lowest Feixianguan Formation. They are the Clarkina liangshanensis, C. wangi, C. subcarinata, C. changxingensis, C. yini, C. meishanensis, and Hindeodus parvus zones in ascending order. Based on the high-resolution biostratigraphical framework at Daijiagou, the end-Permian mass extinction was rapid and it began in the base of the Clarkina meishanensis Zone. Associated with the extinction, a negative excursion of ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}carb{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} started in the middle part of Clarkina yini Zone with a progressive shift of 1.6??? to the middle part of the Clarkina meishanensis, followed by a sharp shift of 3.51??? from the Clarkina meishanensis Zone to the Hindeodus parvus Zone. Our study also suggests that the Triassic index species Hindeodus parvus co-occurred with Hindeodus changxingensis and Clarkina zhejiangensis and directly overlies the Clarkina meishanensis Zone at the Daijiagou section. All these data from the Daijiagou section and some previous studies of other sections in Sichuan, Guizhou provinces and Chongqing City suggest that the first occurrences of Hindeodus parvus are slightly earlier than the sharp negative excursion of ??{\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}carb{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and the FAD at the Meishan GSSP section. We consider that the slight difference of the end-Permian mass extinction, chemostratigraphy and conodont biostratigraphy at Daijiagou and its adjacent areas is most likely subject to different lithofacies, fossil preservation, and the constraint on the stratigraphic resolution rather than a different tempo of the end-Permian mass extinction in a global sense. The whole Changhsingian conodont succession at Daijiagou provides a high-resolution correlation with other equivalent sections in the Palaeotethys. The controversial results of biostratigraphy and chemostratigraphy between the sections investigated in this paper and the Meishan GSSP section also provide some important implications that accurate chronocorrelation requires the evaluation of multiple, varied stratigraphcal signals rather than relying solely on the FAD of the Triassic index species Hindeodus parvus for recognizing the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). Growth series of abundant specimens for each species are figured. The taxonomy of some Hindeodus species in the PTB interval is updated.},

The examined conodont faunas are correlated with well-established conodont zonations of the Canadian Arctic, and in turn also form the basis for regional correlations.},

abstract = {Paleoclimatic time series are often unevenly spaced in time, making it difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of their red-noise spectrum. A Fortran 90 program (REDFIT) is presented that overcomes this problem by fitting a first-order autoregressive (AR1) process, being characteristic for many climatic processes, directly to unevenly spaced time series. Hence, interpolation in the time domain and its inevitable bias can be avoided. The program can be used to test if peaks in the spectrum of a time series are significant against the red-noise background from an AR1 process. Generated and paleoclimatic time series are used to demonstrate the capability of the program. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The dominance of lower-molecular-weight n-alkanes in the samples from the section suggests that algae and bacteria were the dominant contributors to the organic fraction preserved in this marine section, with bacteria particularly enhanced within the stromatolite. The end-Permian biotic crisis coincided with a short-term suppression of autotrophs, indicated by the ratio of pristane (Pr) and phytane (Ph) to C17 and C18n-alkanes, and proliferation of heterotrophs, shown by the ratio of branched-to-normal C17 alkanes. The biotic crisis also may have been associated with a transient oxygenation event in the shallow marine, indicated by elevated Pr/Ph ratios and lowered C27 18$\alpha$(H)-22,29,30-Trisnorneohopane (Ts) to C27 17$\alpha$(H)-22,29,30-Trisnorhopane (Tm) and gammacerane ($\gamma$) to C31 homohopane (C31HP) ratios. Subsequently, three short-term episodes of intensified anoxia or enhanced salinity at Chongyang are recorded by decreases in Pr/Ph ratios in conjunction with lithological boundaries in the section.},

A comparison between seawater sulfate and marine carbonate carbon isotope records reveals no clear systematic coupling between the sulfur and carbon cycles over one to several millions of years, indicating that changes in the burial rate of pyrite sulfur and organic carbon did not singularly control the atmospheric oxygen content over short time intervals in the Cenozoic.

Traditional theories about the role of ectomycorrhizal fungi in plant nutrition have emphasized quantitative effects on uptake and transport of dissolved nutrients. Qualitative effects of the symbiosis on the ability of plants to access organic nitrogen and phosphorus sources have also become increasingly apparent. Recent research suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi mobilize other essential plant nutrients directly from minerals through excretion of organic acids. This enables ectomycorrhizal plants to utilize essential nutrients from insoluble mineral sources and affects nutrient cycling in forest systems.},

abstract = {The Ediacaran Period is characterized by the most profound negative carbon isotope ($\delta$13C) excursion in Earth history, the Shuram Excursion. Various hypotheses – including the massive oxidation of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the oceans, the weathering of terrestrial organic carbon, or the release and oxidation of methane hydrates and/or expelled petroleum from the subsurface – have been proposed as sources of the13C-depleted carbon. More recently, it has been suggested that global-scale precipitation of early authigenic carbonates, driven by anaerobic microbial metabolism in unconsolidated sediments, may have caused the Shuram Excursion, but empirical evidence is lacking. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of a Shuram-associated interval from the uppermost Doushantuo Formation in South China. Our study reveals petrographic evidence of methane-derived authigenic calcite (formed as early diagenetic cements and nodules) that are remarkably depleted in13C – suggesting a buildup of alkalinity in pore fluids through the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) – and systematically depleted in18O relative to co-occurring dolomite. Early authigenesis of these minerals is likely to be driven by increased microbial sulfate reduction, triggered by enhanced continental weathering in the context of a marked rise in atmospheric oxygen levels. In light of the finding of methane-derived authigenic carbonates at Zhongling, and based on our basin-scale stratigraphic correlation, we hypothesize that the marked13C and18O depletion (including their co-variation noted worldwide) in the Shuram Excursion may reflect an episode of authigenesis occurring within a sulfate–methane transition zone (SMTZ). If true, the Shuram Excursion was then a global biogeochemical response to enhanced seawater sulfate concentration in the Ediacaran ocean driven by the Neoproterozoic oxidation of surface environments. This paleo-oceanographic transition may have therefore paved the way for subsequent evolution and diversification of animals. Our study highlights the significance of an integrated approach that combines petrography, mineralogy, and texture-specific micro-drilling geochemistry in chemostratigraphic studies.},

abstract = {The first appearance of Hindeodus parvus (Kozur {\&} Pjatakova) at the Permian-Triassic (P-T) GSSP level (base of Bed 27c) at Meishan is here confirmed. Hin- deodus changxingensisWang occurs from Beds 26 to 29 at Meishan and appears to be restricted to the narrow boundary interval immediately above the main mass extinction level in Bed 25. It is suggested that this species is therefore a valuable P-T boundary interval index taxon. Our collections from the Shangsi section confirm that the first occurrence of Hindeodus parvus in that section is about 5 m above the highest level from which a typical Permian fauna is recovered. This may suggest that that some section may be missing at Meis- han. The age of the currently defined Permian-Triassic Boundary is estimated by our own studies and a re- assessment of previous worker's data at c. 253 Ma, slightly older than our IDTIMS 206Pb/238U age of 252.5 ±0.3 Ma for Bed 28, just 8 cm above the GSSP boundary (Mundil et al., 2001). The age of the main mass extinc- tion, at the base of Bed 25 at Meishan, is estimated at slightly older than 254 Ma based on an age of {\textgreater}254 Ma for the Bed 25 ash. Regardless of the absolute age of the boundary, it is evident that the claimed {\textless}165,000 y short duration for the negative carbon isotope excur- sion at the P-T boundary (Bowring et al., 1998) cannot be confirmed. Purportedly extraterrestrial fullerenes at the boundary (Becker et al., 2001) have equivocal sig- nificance due to their chronostratigraphic non-unique- ness and their occurrence in a volcanic ash.},

abstract = {The 1.88-Ga Gunflint biota is one of the most famous Precambrian microfossil lagerst{\"{a}}tten and provides a key record of the biosphere at a time of changing oceanic redox structure and chemistry. Here, we report on pyritized replicas of the iconic autotrophic Gunflintia-Huroniospora microfossil assemblage from the Schreiber Locality, Canada, that help capture a view through multiple trophic levels in a Paleoproterozoic ecosystem. Nanoscale analysis of pyritic Gunflintia (sheaths) and Huroniospora (cysts) reveals differing relic carbon and nitrogen distributions caused by contrasting spectra of decay and pyritization between taxa, reflecting in part their primary organic compositions. In situ sulfur isotope measurements from individual microfossils ($\delta$(34)S(V-CDT) +6.7‰ to +21.5‰) show that pyritization was mediated by sulfate-reducing microbes within sediment pore waters whose sulfate ion concentrations rapidly became depleted, owing to occlusion of pore space by coeval silicification. Three-dimensional nanotomography reveals additional pyritized biomaterial, including hollow, cellular epibionts and extracellular polymeric substances, showing a preference for attachment to Gunflintia over Huroniospora and interpreted as components of a saprophytic heterotrophic, decomposing community. This work also extends the record of remarkable biological preservation in pyrite back to the Paleoproterozoic and provides criteria to assess the authenticity of even older pyritized microstructures that may represent some of the earliest evidence for life on our planet.},

abstract = {Early diagenetic silicification and phosphatization of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation (ca. 635 to 551Ma) in South China offer extraordinary taphonomic windows into the early evolution of multicellular eukaryotes, including various algal groups and potentially animals. In order to understand how the ecological and taphonomic distribution of these Ediacaran eukaryotes was controlled by oceanic redox conditions, it is critical to reconstruct the redox architecture of the sedimentary basin. Recently two alternative redox models have been proposed to account for the geochemical and sedimentary features of the Doushantuo Formation. One argues that the unit was deposited on a continental margin where a metastable sulfidic wedge was dynamically maintained by a sulfate concentration gradient between shelf and basinal environments. The other contends that the sulfidic water mass was largely restricted to the intra-shelf basin behind a rimmed margin. These two models make different predictions about the stratigraphic completeness and correlation of the Doushantuo Formation. To test these predictions, we generated high-resolution time-series trends of multiple isotopic and elemental tracers, including $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}34{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}S, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}87{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Sr/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}86{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Sr and Ce/Ce*, to facilitate an integrated chemostratigraphic correlation between inner shelf (Xiaofenghe), intra shelf (Jiulongwan), and outer shelf (Yangjiaping and Zhongling) sections. Our correlations suggest that both the inner and outer shelf sections are stratigraphically incomplete relative to the intra shelf section. The euxinic wedge model should be reconsidered insofar as it is based on a miscorrelation between sections. Viewed from our revised chemostratigraphic framework, euxinic conditions on the platform appear to have been largely restricted to the intra shelf basin. Carbonates in the upper Doushantuo Formation at Jiulongwan and their stratigraphic equivalents are characterized by a profound negative carbon isotope anomaly (i.e., the Shuram Excursion) coincident with a drop in pyrite sulfur isotope values and a significant rise in {\textless}sup{\textgreater}87{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Sr/{\textless}sup{\textgreater}86{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}Sr from 0.7080 to 0.7090. The integrated stratigraphic data from South China suggest that the onset of the Shuram Excursion is associated with enhanced oxidative continental weathering that delivered radiogenic strontium, as well as sulfate, to the Ediacaran basin.},

Samples have been analyzed using a 43 Ca- 48 Ca double spike and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). In order to avoid species-dependent isotope fractionation we focused our investigations on a single foraminifera species (Globigerinoides sacculifer), which is known to inhabit shallow euphotic waters in tropical and subtropical oceans. Ca isotope measurements were performed on cultured G. sacculifer that grew in seawater kept at temperatures of 19.5°, 26.5°, and 29.5°C. A $\delta$ 44 Ca change of 0.24 ± 0.02 per 1°C is defined by the weighted linear regression through reproduced $\delta$ 44 Ca data of the three temperatures (95{\%} confidence level). Application of this new method to fossil G. sacculifer of an Equatorial East Atlantic sediment core (GeoB1112; 5°46.7′S, 10°45.0′W, 3125 m) indicates that the $\delta$ 44 Ca difference between marine isotope stage 1 (MIS-1) and MIS-2 is 0.71 ± 0.24. According to the current $\delta$ 44 Ca-temperature calibration this value corresponds to a temperature difference between MIS-1 and MIS-2 of ∼3.0 ± 1.0°C.},

abstract = {It is well known that the equilibration timescale for the isotopic ratios 13C/12C and 14C/12C in the ocean mixed layer is on the order of a decade, 2 orders of magnitude slower than for oxygen. Less widely appreciated is the fact that the equilibration timescale is quite sensitive to the speciation of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the mixed layer, scaling linearly with the ratio DIC/CO2, which varies inversely with atmospheric pCO2. Although this effect is included in models that resolve the role of carbon speciation in air-sea exchange, its role is often unrecognized, and it is not commonly considered in the interpretation of carbon isotope observations. Here we use a global three-dimensional ocean model to estimate the redistribution of the carbon isotopic ratios between the atmosphere and ocean due solely to variations in atmospheric pCO2. Under Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) pCO2, atmospheric $\Delta$14C is increased by ≈30‰ due to the speciation change, all else being equal, raising the surface reservoir age by about 250 years throughout most of the ocean. For 13C, enhanced surface disequilibrium under LGM pCO2 causes the upper ocean, atmosphere, and North Atlantic Deep Water $\delta$13C to become at least 0.2‰ higher relative to deep waters ventilated by the Southern Ocean. Conversely, under high pCO2, rapid equilibration greatly decreases isotopic disequilibrium. As a result, during geological periods of high pCO2, vertical $\delta$13C gradients may have been greatly weakened as a direct chemical consequence of the high pCO2, masquerading as very well ventilated or biologically dead Strangelove Oceans. The ongoing anthropogenic rise of pCO2 is accelerating the equilibration of the carbon isotopes in the ocean, lowering atmospheric $\Delta$14C and weakening $\delta$13C gradients within the ocean to a degree that is similar to the traditional fossil fuel “Suess” effect.},

abstract = {Molar-tooth structures are intricately crumpled, microsparry calcite fissure fills that formed during the Precambrian. Strontium isotope stratigraphy constrains the last occurrence of volumetrically significant molar-tooth structure (MT) in the geological record to ∼ 750 Ma. Although the disappearance of MT is commonly ascribed to the influence of metazoans on sediment cohesion, this now seems less plausible because there is no evidence for significant sediment disruption by metazoans before ∼ 550 Ma. It is proposed here that the most likely alternative explanation for MT disappearance is a change in ocean chemistry. A decrease in CaCO3 saturation and/or an increase in the concentration of precipitation inhibitors in mid-Neoproterozoic seawater may have contributed to MT disappearance, and might also help to explain the approximately contemporaneous decline in stromatolite diversity.},

Discrimination factors were determined for a series of elements (Pb, Mo, Cu, Ni, Cr, Ti and Si) as metallic targets, using an O2+ primary beam. The results show a trend of isotope ratio, and by inference of the fraction of atoms ionized, proportional to M-0.75. Energy-range selection was used to identify a dependence of the measured isotope ratios on the secondary ion energy, favoring the lighter isotopes, ions of lower energy being more fractionated. A small variation with primary ion energy from 0.5 to 13 ke V was also observed fractionation increasing with decreasing primary beam energy. These effects, together with those due to possible instrumental discrimination, must be taken into account for a complete understanding of isotopic measurements obtained by secondary ion mass spectrometry. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

abstract = {Carbon occurs in mantle samples in several chemical, mineralogical and morphological forms. It has been observed as CO2, CH4and CO in fluid inclusions, as carbonate, graphite, diamond, moissanite, solid solution in silicates, and organic compounds. The total carbon concentration reported for mantle xenoliths varies by four orders of magnitude from below 1 ppm to close to 10 000 ppm. About 40{\%} of these samples contain less than 50 ppm, 70{\%} less than 100 ppm and 95{\%} less than 500 ppm C. Carbon with $\delta$13C of about - 5‰ has been identified as a major isotopic composition signature for the mantle (carbonatite and kimberlite carbonates, diamonds and volcanic CO2exhalations); it is also observed in mantle xenoliths. However, there may also be a minor signature of C depleted in13C ($\delta$13C=-22‰ to - 26‰). Such light carbon has been observed in the dissolution residue of mantle minerals (olivine, pyroxene) and rocks, C fractions that have been interpreted as C dissolved in silicates, in diamonds, graphite, carbide, and hydrocarbons which are thought to be indigenous to the mantle. The data on xenoliths from basalts indicate that their $\delta$13C distribution is essentially bimodal with peaks at - 5‰ and - 25‰ although the geologic occurrence of this light carbon has not yet been clearly delineated. Xenoliths from both hotspot and non-hotspot volcanoes cover the whole C isotopic composition range observed in mantle xenoliths; however, on average, xenoliths from non-hotspot volcanoes contain isotopically lighter carbon. Xenoliths from kimberlites cover the whole isotopic composition range as well, but, on average, probably show the lowest degree of13C depletion. In addition, the second, low $\delta$13C, mode may occur just above - 20‰, coincident with the low13C mode of southern African diamonds. Differences in the C concentration and isotopic composition have been observed between mantle minerals. The data are too few, however, to support firm conclusions on their size, or on how systematic these differences might be. Chemically more fractionated xenoliths tend to have higher $\delta$13C values than less chemically fractionated ones. Processes that have been considered to be responsible for the considerable $\delta$13C range in mantle C include the subduction of organic material and degassing. The observations on mantle xenoliths do not provide support for either, but indicate that as yet unexplored thermodynamic isotope effects, probably involving dissolved C in minerals and Si-C bonds, may be responsible for the observed mantle carbon isotope distribution. The occurrence of such isotope effects would help to understand a number of observations on the carbon isotope geochemistry of diamonds. In so far as mantle-degassing models have been based, in part, on the carbon isotopic composition and C/3He ratios, an understanding of the mantle carbon isotope geochemistry is essential to support or refute their validity. The xenolith data do not support degassing models based on the assumption of limited indigenous carbon isotope variability within the mantle, nor the supposition that all13C depleted carbon is of surface origin. The relative proportions of mantle C's of differing isotope signature are not known; they will have to be established for well-founded C cycle models to be developed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Initially, bedrock is the dominant source for Sr and other lithophile elements such as Ca, but high rates of weathering and leaching of the substrate by 20 ka lead to a shift to atmospheric sources. The loss of weathering inputs coincides with other physio-chemical changes in the soil and results in a steep decline of base cations in the soil pool. While these patterns imply the potential for limitation of biological productivity by low base cation supply, the atmosphere provides a supply of base cations in excess of nutritional needs, even after nearly all rock-derived base cations have been leached from the soil. This raises the possibility that P limitation in terrestrial ecosystems may develop at least as much because of low rates of atmospheric deposition of P (relative to Ca, K, and other rock-derived elements) as because of its chemical interaction in soil.},

A stratified ocean with coeval oxic, sulfidic, and ferruginous zones, favored by overall low oceanic sulfate concentrations, was maintained dynamically throughout the Ediacaran Period.

abstract = {Late Eocene nearshore shallow-marine environments within the Bremer and western Eucla Basins of southern Western Australia were characterized by the thick deposition of spongolite and spiculite deposits. Epibenthic sponge communities dominated estuaries and topog. complex basin margin embayments-archipelagos, while cool-water carbonates with up to 10{\%} sponges accumulated in open-shelf environments. The transition from a biosiliceous to calcareous epibenthos was related to the degree of paleogeog. "protection". Within basement-protected embayments there was an offshore gradation from shoreface spongolite and pure spiculite to a muddy spiculite facies towards central embayment areas. Calcareous fossils are rare throughout embayment facies, but rapidly increase in more open outer archipelago areas. This depositional relationship occurred along 2000 km of the Late Eocene southern Australian coastline. Paleogeog. protection from strong currents acted in concert with: (1) a planar, low-gradient inland topog. with sluggish run-off, supplying fine-grained sediment, nutrients, and abundant dissolved silica; and (2) a microtidal setting, weak to moderate swells and opposing wind and Coriolis surface current forcing, which inhibited water exchange between embayments-estuaries and the open shelf. This situation led to an embayment water chem. that encouraged prolific sponge growth. Calcareous spiculites record the mixing front between these embayment waters and normal open-shelf waters supporting cool-water carbonates. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {Marine and terrestrial sediments of the Valanginian age display a distinct positive $\delta$13C excursion, which has recently been interpreted as the expression of an oceanic anoxic episode (OAE) of global importance. Here we evaluate the extent of anaerobic conditions in marine bottom waters and explore the mechanisms involved in changing carbon storage on a global scale during this time interval. We asses redox-sensitive trace-element distributions (RSTE; uranium, vanadium, cobalt, arsenic and molybdenum) and the quality and quantity of preserved organic matter (OM) in representative sections along a shelf-basin transect in the western Tethys, in the Polish Basin and on Shatsky Rise. OM-rich layers corresponding in time to the $\delta$13C shift are generally rare in the Tethyan sections and if present, the layers are not thicker than several centimetres and total organic carbon (TOC) contents do not surpass 1.68 wt..{\%}. Palynological observations and geochemical properties of the preserved OM suggest a mixed marine and terrestrial origin and deposition in an oxic environment. In the Polish Basin, OM-rich layers show evidence for an important continental component. RSTE exhibit no major enrichments during the $\delta$13C excursion in all studied Tethyan sections. RSTE enrichments are, however, observed in the pre-$\delta$13C excursion OM-rich "Barrande" levels of the Vocontian Trough. In addition, all Tethyan sections record higher Mn contents during the $\delta$13C shift, indicating rather well-oxygenated bottom waters in the western Tethys and the presence of anoxic basins elsewhere, such as the restricted basins of the North Atlantic and Weddell Sea. We propose that the Valanginian $\delta$13C shift is the consequence of a combination of increased OM storage in marginal seas and on continents (as a sink of12C-enriched organic carbon), coupled with the demise of shallow-water carbonate platforms (diminishing the storage capacity of13C-enriched carbonate carbon). As such the Valanginian provides a more faithful natural analogue to present-day environmental change than most other Mesozoic OAEs, which are characterized by the development of ocean-wide dysaerobic to anaerobic conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.Stromatolites composed of apatite occur in post-Lomagundi-Jatuli successions (late Palaeoproterozoic) and suggest the emergence of novel types of biomineralization at that time. The microscopic and nanoscopic petrology of organic matter in stromatolitic phosphorites might provide insights into the suite of diagenetic processes that formed these types of stromatolites. Correlated geochemical micro-analyses of the organic matter could also yield molecular, elemental and isotopic compositions and thus insights into the role of specific micro-organisms among these communities. Here, we report on the occurrence of nanoscopic disseminated organic matter in the Palaeoproterozoic stromatolitic phosphorite from the Aravalli Supergroup of north-west India. Organic petrography by micro-Raman and Transmission Electron Microscopy demonstrates syngeneity of the organic matter. Total organic carbon contents of these stromatolitic phosphorite columns are between 0.05 and 3.0 wt{\%} and have a large range of $\delta$13Corg values with an average of -18.5‰ (1$\sigma$ = 4.5‰). $\delta$15N values of decarbonated rock powders are between -1.2 and +2.7‰. These isotopic compositions point to the important role of biological N2-fixation and CO2-fixation by the pentose phosphate pathway consistent with a population of cyanobacteria. Microscopic spheroidal grains of apatite (MSGA) occur in association with calcite microspar in microbial mats from stromatolite columns and with chert in the core of diagenetic apatite rosettes. Organic matter extracted from the stromatolitic phosphorites contains a range of molecular functional group (e.g. carboxylic acid, alcohol, and aliphatic hydrocarbons) as well as nitrile and nitro groups as determined from C- and N-XANES spectra. The presence of organic nitrogen was independently confirmed by a CN- peak detected by ToF-SIMS. Nanoscale petrography and geochemistry allow for a refinement of the formation model for the accretion and phototrophic growth of stromatolites. The original microbial biomass is inferred to have been dominated by cyanobacteria, which might be an important contributor of organic matter in shallow-marine phosphorites. Copyright},

abstract = {The crystal structures of six natural milarities (A2B2C[T2(3)T1(12)O30](H2O)x, P6/mcc, a approximately 10.40, c approximately 13.80 angstrom, Z = 2) covering the range of known compositions have been refined to R indices of approximately 3{\%} using MoK-alpha X-ray intensity data. Previously proposed split-atom models for the A and B sites are confirmed. Polarized spectroscopy in the infrared region shows H2O to be the only significant H-bearing group. Band polarization characteristics show the H-H vector to be perpendicular-to c and the H2O plane to be parallel-to c; this corresponds to the type II H2O found in the related structures of beryl and cordierite. There is a quantitative correlation between band intensity and H2O content, and the observed molar absorptivities are similar to those measured in cordierite. Milarite has a beryllo-alumino-silicate framework structure. The framework is a four-connected three-dimensional net, one of a series of seven simple nets with prominent double rings of tetrahedra previously derived by Hawthorne and Smith (1986). There are 15 minerals with this net as the basic tetrahedral arrangement; in general, Si is strongly to completely ordered into the ring tetrahedra, and the other tetrahedral cations (Li, Be, B, Al, Mg, Fe2+, Fe3+, Mn2+, and Zn) are strongly to completely ordered into the ring-linking tetrahedra. The important substitution in normal milarite is Na(B) + Be(T2) = square B + AlT2 with the amount of Be varying between approximately 1.5 and 2.5 apfu; in (Y,REE)-bearing milarite, the important substitution is (Y,REE)A + Be(T2) = Ca(A) + Al(T2) with the amount of Be varying up to 3.0 atoms pfu. The mean bond lengths of the polyhedra involved in these substitutions vary accordingly, and linear models of this behavior are developed. In addition, there is chemical evidence of a small amount of Al reversible Si substitution at the T1 site. Similar linear models are developed for the whole group of milarite-type minerals. Milarite is found in a variety of environments, from vugs in plutonic rocks through diverse pegmatites to hydrothermal ore deposits and alpine veins; a review of specific parageneses is given. Milarite is a low-temperature hydrothermal mineral crystallizing in the range of 200-250-degrees-C at low pressures. Associated minerals suggest that milarite crystallizes from alkaline fluids with Be being transported as fluor-complexes and carbonate complexes. Other members of the milarite group occur in peralkaline rocks, meteorites, peraluminous volcanic rocks, and high-grade metamorphic rocks, as well as other geochemically more unusual rocks, and form under a wide variety of P-T conditions.},

abstract = {Water movement in upland humid watersheds from the soil surface to the stream is often described using the concept of translatory flow1,2, which assumes that water entering the soil as precipitation displaces the water that was present previously, pushing it deeper into the soil and eventually into the stream. Within this framework, water at any soil depth is well mixed and plants extract the same water that eventually enters the stream2. Here we present water-isotope data from various pools throughout a small watershed in the Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Our data imply that a pool of tightly bound water that is retained in the soil and used by trees does not participate in translatory flow, mix with mobile water or enter the stream. Instead, water from initial rainfall events after rainless summers is locked into small pores with low matric potential until transpiration empties these pores during following dry summers. Winter rainfall does not displace this tightly bound water. As transpiration and stormflow are out of phase in the Mediterranean climate of our study site, two separate sets of water bodies with different isotopic characteristics exist in trees and streams. We conclude that complete mixing of water within the soil cannot be assumed for similar hydroclimatic regimes as has been done in the past3,4. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

These intervals define the duration of so-called Oceanic Anoxic Events during which global marine waters were relatively depleted in oxygen, and deposition of organic matter, derived from both terrestrial and planktonic sources, was widespread. Cretaceous OAEs correlate closely with transgressions, and such a correlation exists throughout the stratigraphical column. Flooding of land-masses is thought to have transported much terrestrial plant material sea- wards; the progressive increase in shelf-sea area is thought to have stimulated production of marine plankton. Bacterial consumption of this organic matter favoured the development of poorly oxygenated mid- to late Cretaceous waters in which many of the characteristic facies of the Period, including glauconitic sandstones and phosphatic chalks, were deposited},

abstract = {Carbonate Associated Sulfate (CAS) is trace sulfate incorporated into carbonate minerals during their precipitation. Its sulfur isotopic composition is often assumed to track that of seawater sulfate and inform global carbon and oxygen budgets through Earth's history. However, many CAS sulfur isotope records based on bulk-rock samples are noisy. To determine the source of bulk-rock CAS variability, we extracted CAS from different internal sedimentary components micro-drilled from well-preserved Late Ordovician and early Silurian-age limestones from Anticosti Island, Quebec, Canada. Mixtures of these components, whose sulfur isotopic compositions vary by nearly 25???, can explain the bulk-rock CAS range. Large isotopic variability of sedimentary micrite CAS (34S-depleted from seawater by up to 15???) is consistent with pore fluid sulfide oxidation during early diagenesis. Specimens recrystallized during burial diagenesis have CAS 34S-enriched by up to 9??? from Hirnantian seawater, consistent with microbial sulfate reduction in a confined aquifer. In contrast to the other variable components, brachiopods with well-preserved secondary-layer fibrous calcite-a phase independently known to be the best-preserved sedimentary component in these strata-have a more homogeneous isotopic composition. These specimens indicate that seawater sulfate remained close to about 25??? (V-CDT) through Hirnantian (end-Ordovician) events, including glaciation, mass extinction, carbon isotope excursion, and pyrite-sulfur isotope excursion. The textural relationships between our samples and their CAS isotope ratios highlight the role of diagenetic biogeochemical processes in setting the isotopic composition of CAS.},

abstract = {Carbon isotope (delta (super 13) C) analyses of marine carbonates spanning the Silurian-Devonian transition are compared from three richly fossiliferous, well-dated sequences in North America. The three sections, in the central Appalachian Mountains (West Virginia), Great Basin (Nevada), and the southern Mid-continent (Oklahoma), reveal positive delta (super 13) C shifts beginning in the late Pridoli and reaching peak values as heavy as +5.8 per mil in the earliest Lochkovian following the first occurrence of the conodont species Icriodus woschmidti and the graptolite Monograptus uniformis. A positive shift in delta (super 13) C is also recorded at this time in Gondwanan regions, including the global stratotype section and point for the Silurian-Devonian boundary at Klonk in the Czech Republic, as well as in sections in the Carnic Alps of Austria (Cellon), and Queensland, Australia. The available data from Euramerica and Gondwana are consistent with a scenario linking seawater delta (super 13) C enrichment to a eustatic drop during the Silurian-Devonian transition. Seawater delta (super 13) C likely increased as a result of enhanced carbonate weathering during exposure and erosion of older Silurian platform deposits. In addition, the fall in sea level appears to have enhanced nutrient delivery to the oceans and triggered an increase in organic carbon burial rates at or near the Silurian-Devonian boundary, as indicated by organic-rich deposition in Gondwanan basins. In terms of its magnitude, the Silurian-Devonian delta (super 13) C excursion of {\textgreater} or =+5 per mil appears to be among the largest well-documented events in the Paleozoic, comparable to the shifts in the Late Ordovician and Early Mississippian.},

The size frequency distribution of the framboids is identical to populations from severely oxygen-restricted modern depositional environments. This change to dysoxic benthic conditions coincides with the rapid demise of diverse Permian brachiopod and bryozoan assemblages. Thus, the link between extinction and anoxia is clearly seen at Guryul Ravine and it provides an interesting contrast to other Perigondwanan sections developed in shallower water where both the onset of anoxia and the extinction occurred somewhat later in the earliest Triassic.},

abstract = {Time-dependent variations in the physicochemical properties of pyrite were investigated in four sediment cores from the Black Sea. In the laminated, deep-basin sediments of Unit I and Unit II, {\textgreater}86{\%} of pyrite particles are present as fine-grained framboidal aggregates. In these sediments, the dominance of pyrite framboids, with a narrow size distribution and maximum size {\textless} 18 mum, is evidence of syngenetic (water column) pyrite formation subjacent to the O-2-H2S boundary. Sediments from the basin margin collected below the impingement of the O-2-H2S boundary contain an increased proportion of fine-grained euhedral grains of pyrite relative to framboidal aggregates, suggesting increased additions of diagenetic pyrite below the sediment-water interface. The more efficient reduction and sulfidation of iron in the water column of the central region of the basin implies a more reactive source of iron there compared to the basin margins, and is tied to increasing {\%}pyrite as framboids and greater degrees of pyritization (DOP) in the basin center relative to the basin margins. An evaluation of Fe-S-C relations indicates that pyrite formation was limited by sulfate availability during deposition of the oldest lacustrine sediments of Unit III, C-limited for upper Unit III due to the input of sulfate-rich Mediterranean seawater, and Fe-limited in the laminated, organic carbon-rich sediments of Units I and II. These changes in pyrite-limiting factors occurred within 4 m of compacted burial representing {\textless} 15 ka. Sediment fabric and framboid size distributions at a shallow, basin-margin site suggest that during two extended periods of Unit II deposition, the O-2-H2S transition retreated to depths below 200 m. However, during these same intervals, the delta S-34 Of pyrite remains uniform compared to overlying and underlying laminated sediments, implying that this chemical signature may not be uniquely tied to the position of the O-2-H2S boundary relative to the sediment-water interface, but rather is likely related to biogeochemical processes.

abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated that glauconitic minerals predominantly form in water depths of mid-shelf to upper slope in modern oceans. These areas tend to have slow sedimentation rates, another commonly cited requisite for glauconitic mineral precipitation. Cambro-Ordovician strata from the southwestern US are rich in glauconitic minerals. Stratigraphic, sedimentological, and petrographic constraints indicate that the glauconitic minerals are autochthonous. In marked contrast to the modern environments of deposition, these Cambro-Ordovician strata formed under very shallow-water to tidal-flat conditions. The trough cross-stratified deposits of the most glauconitic mineral-rich accumulations (glaucarenites) indicate a high energy environment and probably a normal to high rate of sedimentation. The presence of fibroradiated rims of glauconitic minerals on glauconitic mineral pellets, echinoderm fragments, and quartz grains demonstrates that the Cambro-Ordovician glauconitic minerals precipitated on or in close proximity to the sea floor and prior to calcite precipitation. Consequently, glauconitic minerals must have formed under markedly different conditions in the lower Paleozoic than they do today. Thus, the occurrence of glauconitic minerals in the rock record cannot be used a priori as an environmental indicator of either mid-shelf and deeper water and/or a slow rate of sedimentation.},

abstract = {Changes in $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg from marine strata occur globally in association with the end-Triassic mass extinction and the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) during the break up of Pangea. As is typical in deep time, the timing and duration of these isotopic excursions has remained elusive, hampering attempts to link carbon cycle perturbations to specific processes. Here, we report $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg from Late Triassic and Early Jurassic strata near Levanto, Peru, where intercalated dated ash beds permit temporal calibration of the carbon isotope record. Both $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg exhibit a broad positive excursion through the latest Triassic into the earliest Jurassic. The first order positive excursion in $\delta$13Corg is interrupted by a negative shift noted in many sections around the world coincident with the extinction horizon. Our data indicate that the negative excursion lasts 85±25 kyrs, longer than inferred by previous studies based on cyclostratigraphy. A 260±80 kyr positive $\delta$13Corg shift follows, during which the first Jurassic ammonites appear. The overall excursion culminates in a return to pre-perturbation carbon isotopic values over the next 1090±70 kyrs. Via chronologic, isotopic, and biostratigraphic correlation to other successions, we find that $\delta$13Ccarb and $\delta$13Corg return to pre-perturbation values as CAMP volcanism ceases and in association with the recovery of pelagic and benthic biota. However, the initiation of the carbon isotope excursion at Levanto predates the well-dated CAMP sills from North America, indicating that CAMP may have started earlier than thought based on these exposures, or that the onset of carbon cycle perturbations was not related to CAMP.},

abstract = {Six samples of non-mineralized black shale from a Kupferschiefer section in the northern part of the Polish Zechstein Basin (Zdrada IG-8 drill hole: 1026.16– 1026.90 m) were studied for Re–Os isotopes and selected major and trace elements. These black shales, averaging 5.82 wt.{\%} Corg and 1.69 wt.{\%} Stot, display very low base metal values (up to 106 ppb Cu, 792 ppb Pb, and 144 ppb Zn) and have abundances of 64–1376 ppb Re and 0.37– 1.25 ppb Os, with a 187Os/188Os ratio of 6.95–22.5. The regression of all Re–Os data yields an age of 247±20 Ma, which is within the range of uncertainties of previous Rb– Sr and K–Ar geochronological studies. The scatter in the Re–Os data can be explained in terms of fluctuations in sedimentary conditions, i.e., restricted basin with terrestrial influence.},

abstract = {A wide range of sulphate sulphur isotope data has previously been reported for the late Neoproterozoic and early Cambrian (∼600 to 542 Ma), whereas hardly any data exists with respect to the isotopic composition of sulphate oxygen for this time period. Thus, a refinement of the seawater sulphate records for $\delta$SSO434 and $\delta$OSO418 at this time, following an evaluation of the diagenetic history of the studied sediments, can contribute to a better understanding of ocean chemistry. For this purpose $\delta$34S and $\delta$18O of sulphate was measured in phosphorites and carbonates from different paleoenvironmental settings within the Yangtze Platform in China. Fe speciation was also applied in order to constrain water column redox conditions. A number of secondary processes in pore waters are identified by combining sulphate $\delta$34S with sulphate $\delta$18O, pyrite $\delta$34S and Fe speciation. Some samples are characterized by comparably low $\delta$18O and $\delta$SSO434, attributed to preferential incorporation of H2O oxygen during sulphide oxidation. Other samples have elevated oxygen and sulphur isotope values, implying not only bacterial sulphate reduction under closed conditions with respect to sulphate availability, but also bacterial disproportionation of intermediate sulphur species. Samples exhibiting no apparent diagenetic overprint give a range in $\delta$OSO418 of between 13 and 15‰ for the sulphate oxygen isotopic composition of Ediacaran to early Atdabanian seawater. For the post-glacial Ediacaran stage, seawater $\delta$SSO434 values of around 34‰ are indicated, with a possible decrease to ∼25‰ in the late Ediacaran Dengying Formation, due to influx of 34S depleted sulphate driven from oxidised sulphide, and a possible decrease in pyrite burial. A rise in $\delta$SSO434 to ca. 40‰ in the early Cambrian may be connected to more pronounced basinal euxinia and an enhanced draw-down of 32S via intense bacterial sulphate reduction in the water column. This rise in 34S is not accompanied by an increase in $\delta$OSO418, which could reflect a change in either the oxidation mechanism of SO4 or an oceanic fluctuation in $\delta$18O. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Changes in redox conditions during the Changhsingian to Griesbachian spanning the end-Permian mass extinction were recently reported based on analyses of organic molecules. We provide more precise organic-molecular data, that detail redox conditions spanning the end-Permian mass extinction at different palaeowater depths in the neritic Palaeotethys (estimated water depths: 10, 40, 100, and 200 m; Bulla, Huangzhishan, Meishan, and Chaohu sections, respectively) during this period. Here we propose that a change from occasional euxinia to anoxia in the shallow Palaeotethys occurred at the time of the mass extinction intercalated with oxic pulses. The second extinction at 0.7 myr after the main extinction was also caused by anoxia. New and published sulfur-isotope ratios (34S/32S) measured in carbonate-associated sulfate from the neritic Palaeotethys and in sulfide from pelagic central Panthalassa sediments show high values during the Changhsingian, consistent with the development of euxinia. The mass extinction coincided with a global fall in $\delta$34S values, as well as a shift in $\delta$13C values, indicating a global oxidation of H2S. This organic and isotopic geochemistry implies that accumulation of hydrogen sulfide in intermediate and deep waters followed by oxidation of hydrogen sulfide led to dissolved oxygen consumption, surface-water anoxia, and acidification, resulting in the end-Permian mass extinction in the seas.},

abstract = {Complete, continuous marine Permian–Triassic (P–T) boundary sections in the B{\"{u}}kk Mountains, Northern Hungary, represent a ramp setting on the margin of the western Tethys. The Upper Permian succession comprises limestone rich in calcareous algae, foraminifera, and skeletal fragments of metazoans. A significant reduction of biogenic components occurs in the topmost limestone layers below the “boundary shale bed” (BSB). It coincides with the beginning of a gradual negative shift in $\delta$13Ccarb values that continues into the BSB. The BSB consists predominantly of marly siltstones that are similar to the insoluble residue of the underlying limestone. A second biotic decline is recorded in the upper-third of the BSB, where the continuous negative shift in $\delta$13C values is superimposed by a sharp and quasi-symmetric negative peak. The $\delta$13C peak is confined to the shale bed and is not correlated with the lithological change, therefore diagenetic or other secondary effects are ruled out. The carbon isotope signal reflects primary processes related to significant changes in environmental conditions. Correlation and comparison of sedimentological, biotic, geochemical and mineralogical features of the studied sections in the B{\"{u}}kk Mountains with other Tethyan P—T sections in the Southern Alps, Dinarides, Iran, Kasmir (India) and southern China are discussed. The continuous shift in $\delta$13C values is most probably related to a decrease in bioproductivity, whereas the sharp peak is attributed to an addition of C strongly depleted in 13C isotope to the ocean–atmosphere system. The most plausible model is a massive release of methane from gas–hydrate dissociation. This event led to the extinction of the already impoverished biota. Scarcity of metazoans and prolonged unfavourable environmental conditions gave rise to a bloom of microbial communities. Mineralogical and geochemical analyses failed to reveal any evidence for extraterrestrial effects or synchronous volcanism were found in the studied sections.},

abstract = {Size analysis of pyrite framboids has been undertaken on epicontinental Permian-Triassic boundary sections throughout the world in order to evaluate the intensity and duration of anoxia. Mid-paleolatitude sections from the margins of the Boreal (Spitsbergen, Greenland) and Neotethyan oceans (Western Australia) reveal intense anoxia throughout the Permian-Triassic boundary interval with euxinic conditions frequently developing, and dysoxia encountered even in relatively shallow-water settings above storm wave base. At equatorial paleolatitudes, weakly oxygenated (dysoxic) conditions are widely developed in a broad range of water depths including those shallow enough to produce oolite deposition, although euxinia was rare. Western and eastern Tethyan locations reveal a complex and unstable redox history: anoxia in the Hindeodus praeparvus Zone was replaced by oxygenated facies in the Permian-Triassic boundary interval (H. changxingensis to H. parvus zones). Oxygen-poor deposition returned during the succeeding Isarcicella isarcica Zone. The more persistent and intense development of oxygen restriction in cooler water, mid-paleolatitude sections argues against warming and dissolved oxygen decline as the key cause of Permian-Triassic boundary anoxia. In higher paleolatitudes the benthic invertebrate extinctions occurred during a prolonged phase of oxygen-poor deposition, while in equatorial Tethyan locations benthic losses occurred at the end of the first anoxic phase (in the late H. praeparvus Zone).},

abstract = {This paper presents a multicomponent early diagenetic model which explicitly accounts for the coupling of the redox cycles of Fe and Mn to those of oxygen, carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen. Rate expressions are used to represent the oxidation of organic carbon, the oxidation of secondary reduced species formed as byproducts of organic matter oxidation, and the precipitation and dissolution of sulfide and carbonate minerals. The net rate of organic carbon oxidation is broken down into the contributions of aerobic respiration, denitrification, dissimilatory Mn(IV) reduction, dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis. The computational algorithm is based on a modified Monod kinetics formulation for the organic matter degradation pathways. The non-specific adsorption of ammonia, the surface complexation of Fe2+ and Mn2+ cations, and the homogeneous interconversions within the dissolved carbonate-sulfide system are treated as equilibrium reactions. The transport processes included are sediment advection, pore water diffusion, and particle mixing and irrigation by benthic macrofauna. Chemical component concentrations and pore water alkalinity are described by a set df continuity equations characterized by nonlinear reaction rate terms. The equations are solved by finite-difference. The distribution of pore water pH is derived from the calculated profiles of total dissolved inorganic carbon, total dissolved sulfide, and alkalinity. Particulate deposition fluxes and bottom water composition are imposed as upper boundary conditions. The model is applied to an extensive set of data collected in a marine sediment from the Skagerrak (Denmark). Theoretical depth profiles reproduce the measured pore water concentrations of O-2, NO3-, NH4+, Mn2+. and Fe2+ ins the solid sediment concentrations of Fe(III), Mn(TV), sulfide-bound Fe(II), and non-sulfide Fe(II). The model also correctly simulates the depth distribution of measured sulfate reduction rates. According to the computations, approximately two thirds of the total rate of iron reduction in the sediment are utilized directly by bacteria to oxidize organic carbon (dissimilatory Fe reduction). Manganese reduction, on the other hand, is mostly due to chemical reaction with dissolved Fe2+. Despite the relatively high rates of iron and manganese reduction, only very small amounts of the Fe(II) and Mn(II) produced during early diagenesis are permanently buried in the deeper sediment. Most of the dissolved and solid-bound Fe(II) and Mn(II) cations reoxidize in the surface sediment or escape to the water column. The main oxidation pathways in the sediment are heterogeneous oxygenation of surface complexed Fe2+ and Mn2+ cations. The model also predicts that intense redox cycling of Fe and Mn should cause the appearance of a pH minimum at the base of the aerobic surface layer.},

abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth's biota is entering a sixth “mass extinction” depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the “background” rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

abstract = {Existing interpretations of cement textures and isotopic compositions may significantly under‐estimate the depth and duration of concretionary growth. Minus‐cement porosities can commonly under‐estimate depths of concretionary growth for some, or all, of the following reasons; (i) cements might not passively replace host sediment porosity, (ii) non‐cement carbonate phases (such as replaced bioclastic carbonate) can be significant, (iii) sediment compaction models over‐estimate rates of porosity loss at shallow ({\textless}500 m) depths and (iv) cementation can create a framework that prevents compaction and preserves porosity. Cement textures can be used to distinguish two modes of growth; concentric growth, where successive layers of cement are added to the outer surface (radius increases with time), and pervasive growth, where cement crystals grow simultaneously throughout the concretion volume (little or no radius increase with time). Cement textures of siderite concretions are mostly consistent with pervasive growth, but many calcite microsparite concretions show no diagnostic textural features and could grow either concentrically or pervasively. Concretionary cementation, whether concentric or pervasive, occurred such that there was accessible porosity which could be filled by later cements. Pervasive growth in particular is associated with the retention of substantial amounts of porosity which may be filled by chemically and isotopically distinct phases. The resulting chemical gradients across concretions may then reflect variations in the relative proportions of early and later cements more than variations in porewater composition. Carbon isotope data from modern sediments show that dissolved carbonate in the methanogenic zone has a continuum of values from −30‰ to +15‰, and thus overlaps 13C‐depleted values normally considered characteristic of sulphate reduction. Many concretions previously thought to have grown entirely during sulphate reduction may therefore have continued cementation during methanogenesis, indicating a deeper and more prolonged cementation history. The necessary carbonate supersaturation for concretionary growth could either occur throughout the porewaters (the equilibrium model), or be generated in situ by organic matter decay (the local‐equilibrium model), or created where external fluids are introduced (the fluid‐mixing model).},

abstract = {The heterodont bivalve Sinbadiella pygmaea gen. et sp. nov. is described from the Sinbad Limestone Member (Olenekian, Smithian) of the Lower Triassic Moenkopi Formation of Utah (USA). The new taxon is tentatively assigned to the Lucinidae on the grounds of its external morphology, larval shell morphology and hinge characters. It is the only definite representative of the Superorder Heterodonta in the Olenekian, removing this major clade of bivalves from the long list of Early Triassic Lazarus taxa. Although at least locally very abundant, the new taxon has been overlooked by earlier workers, probably due to its minute size. Dwarfism is a widespread phenomenon in Early Triassic faunas, which has been attributed to ongoing reduction of primary production. If S. pygmaea was a lucinid, a chemosymbiotic feeding mode can be inferred, which might explain why it was able to thrive in conditions that suppressed filter feeding heterodonts. {\textcopyright} The Palaeontological Association.},

abstract = {[1] The Mg/Ca ratio in foraminiferal shells is widely used as a proxy for paleotemperatures. Nevertheless, it seems that the basic Mg content of foraminifera is determined by biological factors, as can be concluded from the large inter species and intrashell variability and the frequent deviations from inorganic behavior. This paper discusses three possible ways by which foraminifera can control or modify the Mg content in their shell: ( 1) involvement of organic matrix in the precipitation process that may alter the partition coefficient of Mg in biogenic calcite, ( 2) controlled conversion of transient amorphous phases to calcite, and ( 3) modification of the Mg concentration in the parent solution from which the crystals precipitate. The first two mechanisms are probably responsible for the precipitation of high-Mg calcite phases ( whole shell or sublayers), while the third mechanism leads to the formation of low-Mg calcite phases. We propose a model adapted from epithelial cells that allows massive Mg2+ removal from the biomineralization site. This model is especially relevant to the planktonic and deep benthic low-Mg foraminifera that are frequently used for paleotemperature reconstructions. We discuss the possible biological roles of Mg in the shell in terms of the calcite polymorph conservation, the in vivo chemical stability of the shell, the functions of Mg as a stabilizer of transient phases and as a controlling agent of the precipitation process. Several temperature sensitive biological processes that may influence the Mg/Ca ratio of the shell are suggested and a model that combines biogenic and inorganic considerations is presented. The model uses Mg heterogeneity in the shell together with temperature response ( biologic and inorganic) of biomineralization processes, to account for the deviation of planktonic foraminifera from inorganic calcite at equilibrium with seawater.},

abstract = {Iron (Fe) has long been a recognized physiological requirement for life, yet for many microorganisms that persist in water, soils and sediments, its role extends well beyond that of a nutritional necessity. Fe(II) can function as an electron source for iron-oxidizing microorganisms under both oxic and anoxic conditions and Fe(III) can function as a terminal electron acceptor under anoxic conditions for iron-reducing microorganisms. Given that iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, iron redox reactions have the potential to support substantial microbial populations in soil and sedimentary environments. As such, biological iron apportionment has been described as one of the most ancient forms of microbial metabolism on Earth, and as a conceivable extraterrestrial metabolism on other iron-mineral-rich planets such as Mars. Furthermore, the metabolic versatility of the microorganisms involved in these reactions has resulted in the development of biotechnological applications to remediate contaminated environments and harvest energy.},

The flux of submarine groundwater discharge has been hypothesized to be a pathway for enriching coastal waters in nutrients, carbon and metals2. Here, we estimate the submarine groundwater flux from the inventory of 228Ra in the upper Atlantic Ocean, obtained by interpolating measurements at over 150 stations. Only 46{\%} of the loss in 228Ra from radioactive decay is replenished by input from dust, rivers and coastal sediments. We infer that the remainder must come from submarine groundwater discharge. Using estimates of 228Ra concentrations in submarine groundwater discharge, we arrive at a total flux from submarine groundwater discharge of 2–41013 m3 yr- 1, between 80 and 160{\%} of the amount of freshwater entering the Atlantic Ocean from rivers. Submarine groundwater discharge is not a freshwater flux, but a flux of terrestrial and sea water that has penetrated permeable coastal sediments. Our assessment of the volume of submarine groundwater discharge confirms that this flux represents an important vehicle for the delivery of nutrients, carbon and metal to the ocean.},

abstract = {Shortly after the deposition of black shales in the Rhaetian Sea (Central European Basin, CEB), the Triassic/Jurassic (Tr/J) boundary witnessed one of the Big Five mass extinction events in Earth's history. Aiming at a better understanding of paleoenvironmental changes in the (geochemically) less well-known middle to late Rhaetian (German subdivision), we studied samples from a cored borehole from the central Rhaetian Sea in NW Germany (Hebelermeer 2). Biomarkers, palynomorphs and bulk geochemistry all support a marine/brackish setting with inputs from terrestrial plants. Dinosteranes were found throughout the core, most likely suggesting the spread of dinoflagellates. It is widely accepted that volcanic exhalations during the development of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) had a major impact on marine and terrestrial environments in the earliest Jurassic e.g., the development of photic zone euxinia and H2S poisoning of benthic life. There is evidence from the studied core, however, that comparable conditions already thrived in the central Rhaetian Sea during the middle Rhaetian. A first indication of euxinia/anoxia is evident from low to very low total organic carbon versus total sulfur (TOC/TS) ratios ({\~{}}{\textless}1) with a minimum preceding the Tr/J boundary (0.03). The latter very low value hints at a decoupling of S and C cycles and eventually abiogenic pyrite formation. Water-column anoxia during the middle Rhaetian is indicated by the occurrence of the biomarker gammacerane, which records ciliates living at the O2-H2S chemocline. The strongest support for a stratified water column even with photic zone euxinia comes from high abundances of isorenieratane. This biomarker is a pigment of anoxygenic phototrophic green sulfur bacteria, which use H2S for photosynthesis. Our data point to perturbations in the biogeochemical cycles of sulfur and carbon already in the middle Rhaetian, which are possibly linked to early volcanic activities and SO2, H2S, and CO2 eruptions.},

It performs solar occultation measurements in the Venus atmosphere in the IR region (2.2-4.3$\mu$m), at a resolution of 0.12-0.18cm-1. The wavelength range probed by SOIR allows a detailed chemical inventory of the Venus atmosphere above the cloud layer (65-150km) to be made with emphasis on the vertical distributions of gases. Thanks to the SOIR spectral resolution, a new CO2 absorption band was identified: the 21101-01101 band of 16O12C18O with R branch up to J=31. Two other previously reported bands were observed dispelling any doubts about their identifications: the 20001-00001 band of 16O13C18O [Villanueva G, et al.

abstract = {Many features of global diversity compilations have proven robust to continued sampling and taxonomic revision. Inherent biases in the stratigraphic record may nevertheless substantially affect estimates of global taxonomic diversity. Here we focus on short-term (epoch-level) changes in apparent diversity. We use a simple estimate of the amount of marine sedimentary rock available for sampling: the number of formations in the stratigraphic Lexicon of the United States Geological Survey. We find this to be positively correlated with two independent estimates of rock availability: global outcrop area derived from the Paleogeographic Atlas Project (University of Chicago) database, and percent continental flooding. Epoch-to-epoch changes in the number of formations are positively correlated with changes in sampled Phanerozoic marine diversity at the genus level. We agree with previous workers in finding evidence of a diversity-area effect that is substantially weaker than the effect of the amount of preserved sedimentary rock. Once the mutual correlation among change in formation numbers, in diversity, and in area flooded is taken into consideration, there is relatively little residual correlation between change in diversity and in the extent of continental flooding. These results suggest that much of the observed short-term variation in marine diversity may be an artifact of variation in the amount of rock available for study. Preliminary results suggest the same possibility for terrestrial data. Like the comparison between change in number of formations and change in sampled diversity, which addresses short-term variation in apparent diversity, the comparison between absolute values of these quantities, which relates to longer-term patterns, also shows a positive correlation. Moreover, there is no clear temporal trend in the residuals of the regression of sampled diversity on number of formations. This raises the possibility that taxonomic diversity may not have increased substantially since the early Paleozoic. Because of limitations in our data, however, this question must remain open.},

abstract = {Linguliform brachiopods are traditionally considered a conservative group which seems to pass through the late Permian extinction without any significant loss and even appear to thrive immediately after the extinction peak. In the Southern Alps, lingulids are very common in the post-extinction Mazzin Member (early Induan) of the Werfen Formation. Sparse occurrences are also known in the overlying Siusi and Gastropod Oolite members (late Induan and early Olenekian in age respectively). The recent discovery of well preserved specimens from a pre-extinction bed of the Bellerophon Formation (Changhsingian) has permitted a detailed comparative analysis, mostly based on the interior characters, preserved in the lingulid succession from across the extinction beds. The following effects on the lingulid populations have been analyzed: i) change in taxonomic assessment; ii) adaptive strategies during the surviving and recovery phases; and iii) environmental proxy connected with the killing mechanisms of the late Permian extinction. The pre-extinction individuals belong to Lingularia? cf. smirnovae Biernat and Emig, a species that is characterized by large-sized shells with a short lophophoral cavity. The post-extinction populations belong to different species and, probably, even to a different genus. The first post-extinction population (early Induan), with small-sized shells and long lophophoral cavity, has been referred to Lingularia yini (Peng and Shi). It records the most severe effects of the late Permian extinction on the marine ecosystems. The late Induan-Olenekian Lingularia borealis (Bittner), with large sized shells and long lophophoral cavity, appears during the first phase of the Triassic biotic recovery. The main adaptive strategies of Lingularia yini, in comparison with the Permian species, include: i) shell miniaturization; ii) increasing of the lophophoral cavity surface (respiratory surface); and iii) increasing of shell width/length ratio. These modifications are interpreted as adaptations towards warming and hypoxia, two main killing mechanisms of the marine biota. The recovery species Lingularia borealis maintains a large lophophoral cavity, indicating an adaptation towards predominant low oxygenated bottom marine waters. The appearance and the great abundance of Lingularia yini in the Mazzin Member (early Induan) represent a proxy of dysaerobic conditions, which determined the appearance of the second phase of the Lilliput biota, characterized by the definitive disappearance of the rhynchonelliform brachiopods and calcareous algae in the Southern Alps. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Large igneous provinces (LIPs) are known for their rapid production of enormous volumes of magma (up to several million cubic kilometres in less than a million years), for marked thinning of the lithosphere, often ending with a continental break-up, and for their links to global environmental catastrophes. Despite the importance of LIPs, controversy surrounds even the basic idea that they form through melting in the heads of thermal mantle plumes. The Permo-Triassic Siberian Traps--the type example and the largest continental LIP--is located on thick cratonic lithosphere and was synchronous with the largest known mass-extinction event. However, there is no evidence of pre-magmatic uplift or of a large lithospheric stretching, as predicted above a plume head. Moreover, estimates of magmatic CO(2) degassing from the Siberian Traps are considered insufficient to trigger climatic crises, leading to the hypothesis that the release of thermogenic gases from the sediment pile caused the mass extinction. Here we present petrological evidence for a large amount (15 wt{\%}) of dense recycled oceanic crust in the head of the plume and develop a thermomechanical model that predicts no pre-magmatic uplift and requires no lithospheric extension. The model implies extensive plume melting and heterogeneous erosion of the thick cratonic lithosphere over the course of a few hundred thousand years. The model suggests that massive degassing of CO(2) and HCl, mostly from the recycled crust in the plume head, could alone trigger a mass extinction and predicts it happening before the main volcanic phase, in agreement with stratigraphic and geochronological data for the Siberian Traps and other LIPs.},

Authigenic carbonate nodules have been recovered from the same areas during the MEDINETH cruise in July 1999. Large 13C depletions of authigenic calcite, aragonite and dolomite indicate methane as a major carbon source for the carbonate. Crust pavements are formed when methane from a freshly emplaced, methane-charged mud flow is oxidised at the seafloor. In this environment, where bottom waters provide the sulphate and magnesium, aragonite is favoured versus calcite and accounts for the majority of the methane-related authigenic carbonates. Calcite, when present, contains significant amounts of Mg2+ (high-Mg calcite), and possibly other divalent ions in its crystal lattice. In areas of brine seep and accumulation, dolomitic nodules are present at shallow depth in the sediment. The 18O enrichment of the authigenic carbonates (up to 4 ‰ greater than calculated values for carbonates precipitating from modern eastern Mediterranean bottom waters) is interpreted as due to precipitation from 18O-rich fluids rather than as a temperature effect. The source of the 18O-rich fluids may be multiple and possibly includes the destabilisation of gas hydrates present at shallow subbottom depth, and the seepage of relic Messinian brines. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Rising concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are changing the carbonate chemistry of the oceans, a process known as ocean acidification (OA). Absorption of this CO2 by the surface oceans is increasing the amount of total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and bicarbonate ion (HCO3 −) available for marine calcification yet is simultaneously lowering the seawater pH and carbonate ion concentration ([CO3 2−]), and thus the saturation state of seawater with respect to aragonite (Ωar). We investigated the relative importance of [HCO3 −] versus [CO3 2−] for early calcification by new recruits (primary polyps settled from zooxanthellate larvae) of two tropical coral species, Favia fragum and Porites astreoides. The polyps were reared over a range of Ωar values, which were manipulated by both acid-addition at constant pCO2 (decreased total [HCO3 −] and [CO3 2−]) and by pCO2 elevation at constant alkalinity (increased [HCO3 −], decreased [CO3 2−]). Calcification after 2 weeks was quantified by weighing the complete skeleton (corallite) accreted by each polyp over the course of the experiment. Both species exhibited the same negative response to decreasing [CO3 2−] whether Ωar was lowered by acid-addition or by pCO2 elevation—calcification did not follow total DIC or [HCO3 −]. Nevertheless, the calcification response to decreasing [CO3 2−] was nonlinear. A statistically significant decrease in calcification was only detected between Ωar = {\textless}2.5 and Ωar = 1.1–1.5, where calcification of new recruits was reduced by 22–37{\%} per 1.0 decrease in Ωar. Our results differ from many previous studies that report a linear coral calcification response to OA, and from those showing that calcification increases with increasing [HCO3 −]. Clearly, the coral calcification response to OA is variable and complex. A deeper understanding of the biomineralization mechanisms and environmental conditions underlying these variable responses is needed to support informed predictions about future OA impacts on corals and coral reefs.},

abstract = {The results of a theoretical isotope mass balance model are presented for the time dependence of burial and weathering-plus-degassing fluxes within the combined long-term carbon and sulfur cycles. Averaged data for oceanic $\delta$13C and $\delta$34S were entered for every million years from 270 to 240 Ma (middle Permian to middle Triassic) to study general trends across the Permian-Triassic boundary. Results show a drop in the rate of global organic matter burial during the late Permian and a predominance of low values during the early-to-middle Triassic. This overall decrease with time is ascribed mainly to epochs of conversion of high biomass forests to low biomass herbaceous vegetation resulting in a decrease in the production of terrestrially derived organic debris. Additional contributions to lessened terrestrial carbon burial were increased aridity and a drop in sea level during the late Permian which led to smaller areas of low-lying coastal wetlands suitable for coal and peat deposition. Mirroring the drop in organic matter deposition was an increase in the burial of sedimentary pyrite, and a dramatic increase in the calculated global mean ratio of pyrite-S to organic-C. High S/C values resulted from an increase of deposition in marine euxinic basins combined with a decrease in the burial of low-pyrite associated terrestrial organic matter. The prediction of increased oceanic anoxia during the late Permian and early Triassic agrees with independent studies of the composition of sedimentary rocks. Weathering plus burial fluxes for organic carbon and pyrite sulfur were used to calculate changes in atmospheric oxygen. The striking result is a continuous drop in O2 concentration from ∼30{\%} to ∼13{\%} over a twenty million year period. This drop was brought about mainly by a decrease in the burial of terrestrially derived organic matter. but with a possible contribution from the weathering of older organic matter on land. It must have exerted a considerable influence on animal evolution because of the role of O2 in respiration. Some examples are the extinction of many vertebrates, loss of giant insects and amphibians, and the restriction of animals to low elevations. It is concluded that the extinction of plants may have contributed to the extinction of animals. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The origin and evolution of photosynthesis have long remained enigmatic due to a lack of sequence information of photosynthesis genes across the entire photosynthetic domain. To probe early evolutionary history of photosynthesis, we obtained new sequence information of a number of photosynthesis genes from the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium tepidum and the green nonsulfur bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus. A total of 31 open reading frames that encode enzymes involved in bacteriochlorophyll/porphyrin biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, and photosynthetic electron transfer were identified in about 100 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple magnesium-tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes using a combination of distance, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods indicate that heliobacteria are closest to the last common ancestor of all oxygenic photosynthetic lineages and that green sulfur bacteria and green nonsulfur bacteria are each other's closest relatives. Parsimony and distance analyses further identify purple bacteria as the earliest emerging photosynthetic lineage. These results challenge previous conclusions based on 16S ribosomal RNA and Hsp60/Hsp70 analyses that green nonsulfur bacteria or heliobacteria are the earliest phototrophs. The overall consensus of our phylogenetic analysis, that bacteriochlorophyll biosynthesis evolved before chlorophyll biosynthesis, also argues against the long-held Granick hypothesis.},

abstract = {The degree of isotopic variation in fossil organic matter renders bulk $\delta$13C signatures strongly influenced by molecular isotopic heterogeneity. For example, in fossil wood the relative abundance of less depleted13C moieties, i.e. preserved13C enriched polysaccharides versus the relatively13C depleted lignin moieties, can be seen to significantly bias $\delta$13Cfossil woodvalues. Moreover the variation in $\delta$13C values of specific compounds within fossil material are themselves highly variable and reflect the heterogeneity in isotopic values of different carbon atoms within individual compounds. For studies using $\delta$13C values of fossil plant material as proxies (e.g., for $\delta$13Cpalaeoatmosphere, $\delta$13Cbiomass) it is recommended that the biases introduced through molecular heterogeneity, preservation type and taxonomic status of the fossil material are determined initially. Biases inherent in the bulk signature can then be reduced, rendering this value more robust. Alternatively, compound specific stable carbon isotope measurements of individual moieties preserved through geological time might prove to be an alternative proxy for monitoring changes in the bulk $\delta$13C value of the plant and might reveal atmospherically induced trends. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cretaceous marine strata deposited in shallow to intermediate depths in the Western Interior seaway of North America show considerable variation in organic-carbon enrichment and degree of pyrite formation. The extreme range of paleoceanographic and depositional conditions that occurred in this seaway provide a unique opportunity to examine the effects of iron-, carbon-, and sulfur-limitation on pyrite formation in one region over about 30 my. Most of the Upper Cretaceous section consists of thick, rapidly deposited, black-shale units such as the Pierre Shale and its equivalents deposited during regressive stages of the seaway. Most of these black shales have organic-carbon contents of less than 2 percent and pyrolysis hydrogen indices that are less than 100, indicating that the organic matter is refractory. This organic matter probably was not suitable for extensive bacterial metabolism, so that pyrite formation in these shales was most likely limited by availability of reactive carbon. Two major transgressive stages of the seaway resulted in deposition of relatively thin, more slowly deposited pelagic carbonate units, the Bridge Creek Member of The Greenhorn Limestone and the Niobrara Formation. During these transgressive stages, periodic increased freshwater runoff led to increased water-column stability. These periods of increased stratification produced anoxic to slightly oxic bottom waters and enhanced preservation of primarily marine organic matter. Some of the more marly to shaly beds in each of these transgressive pelagic carbonate units have organic-carbon concentrations as hieh as 7 percent and pyrolysis hydrogen indices as high as 650 indicating that both units have significant hydrocarbon generating potential. All the iron in the Bridge Creek and Niobrara carbonate units apparently was reactive and has been converted to pyrite so that pyrite formation in these two units was severely iron limited. In addition, some black-shale units deposited during transgressive episodes (Mowry and Belle Fourche Shales and Sharon Springs Member of the Pierre Shale) contain abundant reactive organic matter, at least in some parts of the basin, and are iron-limited with regard to pyrite formation. Ternary diagrams of the system Fe-S-OC, together with some measure of the reactivity of organic matter (pyrolysis hydrogen index), provide a rapid means of recognizing iron-, carbon-, and sulfur-limitation on pyrite formation in a series of samples from a single lithologic unit. Iron limitation is indicated by a concentration of data along a line of constant S/Fe ratio on a Fe-S-OC ternary diagram. Carbon limitation is indicated by a concentration of data along a line of constant S/OC ratio. Sulfur-limitation is suggested by the lack of a systematic Fe-S-OC relationship and residual organic matter that is high in abundance and reactivity.},

abstract = {The sulfur isotopic composition of carbonate associated sulfate (CAS) has been used to investigate the geochemistry of ancient seawater sulfate. However, few studies have quantified the reliability of $\delta$34S of CAS as a seawater sulfate proxy, especially with respect to later diagenetic overprinting. Pyrite, which typically has depleted $\delta$34S values due to authigenic fractionation associated with bacterial sulfate reduction, is a common constituent of marine sedimentary rocks. The oxidation of pyrite, whether during diagenesis or sample preparation, could thus adversely influence the sulfur isotopic composition of CAS. Here, we report the results of CAS extractions using HCl and acetic acid with samples spiked with varying amounts of pyrite. The results show a very strong linear relationship between the abundance of fine-grained pyrite added to the sample and the resultant abundance and $\delta$34S value of CAS. This data represents the first unequivocal evidence that pyrite is oxidized during the CAS extraction process. Our mixing models indicate that in samples with much less than 1 wt.{\%} pyrite and relatively high $\delta$34Spyrite values, the isotopic offset imparted by oxidation of pyrite should be much less than −4‰. Awealth of literature exists on the oxidation of pyrite by Fe3+ and we believe this mechanism drives the oxidation of pyrite during CAS extraction, during which the oxygen used to form sulfate is taken from H2O, not O2. Consequently, extracting CAS under anaerobic conditions would only slow, but not halt, the oxidation of pyrite. Future studies of CAS should attempt to quantify pyrite abundance and isotopic composition. {\textcopyright}},

Reexamination of distinctive phyllosilicates, unique to a single stratigraphic level, in paleosols located just above the isotopically defined Permian-Triassic boundary in Australia and Antarctica furnishes additional tests of this hypothesis. Illite is the dominant clay mineral in earliest Triassic paleosols from Antarctica, but the palleosols also contain conspicuous green nodules of coarsely crystalline berthierine. Examples from the geologic record and from experimental studies indicate that the formation of berthierine is restricted to reducing conditions. The occurrence of this unusual mineral in soils may indicate soil oxygen consumption by the influx of atmospheric methane to form carbon dioxide, which in turn warmed the earliest Triassic, giving rise to a postapocalyptic greenhouse.},

The ratios of elements which do not enter the core (lithophile) are the same in the bulk Earth as in the mantle. Bulk earth ratios involving an element that does enter the core (siderophile) are therefore determined from meteorite correlation diagrams of siderophile-lithophile ratios vs. lithophile-lithophile ratios and from primitive mantle composition in elements which do not enter the core (e.g., Al). The composition of the core is determined by difference, without resorting to assumptions about core formation processes. It is found that the core contains about 7.3 wt{\%} silicon and 2.3 wt{\%} sulphur. To account for the seismologically determined density deficit of the core, about 4 wt{\%} oxygen must be added. The present results are compatible with the idea that the core material equilibrated at low pressure, in reducing conditions. Furthermore, we propose that the Earth is closer to CM rather than to C1 for non-volatile element ratios. {\textcopyright} 1995 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The age and duration of the Emeishan basalts (SW China) remain poorly constrained largely due to the severe thermo-tectonic overprinting of the Ar-Ar system and failure to obtain zircon separates from erupted basalts. In an attempt to solve this problem, geochemical analyses and SHRIMP zircon U-Pb dating have been carried out on rare felsic ignimbrite in the uppermost of the Emeishan lava succession, the Xuanwei Formation which immediately overlies the Emeishan basalts and a clay tuff at the Middle-Late Permian boundary at the Chaotian section. Clastic rocks of the lowermost Xuanwei Formation (Group 1) in eastern Emeishan large igneous province (LIP) have a geochemical affinity to the Emeishan felsic volcanic rocks, whereas the overlying sediments (Group 2) are compositionally more akin to mafic components of the Emeishan traps. This is the reverse of volcanic sequence of the central Emeishan LIP where the felsic extrusives sit above predominant mafic rocks. It is likely that the clastic rocks are water-transported sediments resulting from erosion of the volcanic rocks in the center of the Emeishan LIP. This interpretation is further supported by the general agreement between the age of the lowermost Xuanwei Formation (257 ?? 4??Ma; 260 ?? 5??Ma) and that of the silicic ignimbrite (263 ?? 4??Ma) and the clay tuff at the Middle-Late Permian boundary at Chaotian (260 ?? 5??Ma). These ages, interpreted as the termination age of the Emeishan volcanism, are indistinguishable within error from the Middle-Late Permian boundary age (260.4 ?? 0.4??Ma) and the main stage (259-262 ?? 3??Ma) of the Emeishan volcanism inferred from dating of mafic and alkaline intrusions in the Emeishan LIP. All these suggest that the emplacement of the Emeishan volcanism took place over a very short interval. Moreover, the temporal link and geochemical analyses suggest that the Chaotian clay at the Middle-Late Permian boundary was genetically related to the Emeishan silicic volcanism. This, together with the fact at that both the Emeishan basalts and the Chaotian clay rest on the Maokou Formation, leads us to infer that the Emeishan basalt was emplaced at the Middle-Late Permian boundary. In this sense, the Emeishan volcanism can be regarded as a boundary event and its age is presumed at ?????260??Ma. Although more precise dating is required, both stratigraphic correlation and chronologic data presented in this paper lend supports to the notion that the Emeishan volcanism was one of likely causes of the end-Guadalupian mass extinction. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Early Triassic carbon isotopes are measured based on 1422 carbonate bulk samples from 10 Lower Triassic sections in different palaeogeographic settings in South China. Early Triassic fluctuation of d13C is used as a proxy for environmental change to discuss the devastation and restoration of marine ecosystems following the biggest Phanerozoic mass extinction at the end of the Permian. Early Triassic d13C profiles derived from various depositional settings in South China yield comparable excursion patterns. A dramatic negative shift of d13C across the Permian/Triassic boundary is followed by a moderate increase in d13Cvalues throughout the Induan.Apositive d13Canomaly occurs near the Induan/Olenekian boundary, followed by a Smithian interval of lower d13C values.Adistinct positive shift in d13C coincides with the Smithian/Spathian boundary, and is followed by a high Spathian plateau of d13C values. Thus the distinct d13C anomalies coincide well with key stratigraphic boundaries. Early Triassic intervals of lowd13C values correspond to a decline in benthic generic diversity in South China and intervals of high d13Cvalues are coupled with an increase in biodiversity. The Early Triassic fluctuations of d13Cprofiles are good proxies for perturbations of ecologic environments, indicating multiple phases of devastation–restoration of marine ecosystems punctuated by several unexpected extraneous events such as volcanic activity. The initial restoration of marine ecosystems may have occurred earlier in the Induan and the ecosystems were subsequently destroyed during the Smithian. Biotic and environmental recoveries occurred at the Spathian, while the ecosystems eventually returned to normal levels in the early Middle Triassic.},

abstract = {New crystalline structures have been observed in argon ion-milled conodont elements from a diverse suite of Ordovician taxa (‘Cordylodus robustus', Drepanoistodus suberectus, Panderodus gracilis, Plectodina? sp., Aphelognathus sp., Periodon aculeatus), using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Electron diffraction patterns of albid tissue reveal that the component crystals are extraordinarily large, in the order of hundred(s) of microns. These large albid crystals show typical cancellate porosity, although a distinctly lamellar structure has also been observed within a large albid crystal positioned between hyaline lamellar and cancellate albid tissues. There is a distinct absence of ‘interlamellar space' within all hyaline tissues examined, which are characterized by a polycrystalline matrix of micron-scale elongate crystals that are both strongly aligned and tightly bound within a broader lamellar structure. Optical opacity, caused by light scattering within large (≥ 0.5 µm) pores, is also a feature of both albid and polycrystalline lamellar crown tissues. Accordingly, conodont hard tissues are differentiated by crystal size and shape, as well as inter- and intracrystalline porosity. These new observations highlight the structural complexities of conodont histologies and the need for more comprehensive investigations particularly of transitional crown tissues, which are not well defined by terms typically used in the literature. Their histological structures are interpreted to be a product of in vivo crystallization and thus provide new insights into the relative porosity, permeability, and inherent integrity of the tissues as well as their growth relationships. Accordingly, these data not only have implications for earlier histological and palaeobiological interpretations of conodont hard tissues but are also fundamental in determining their chemical integrity, which is crucial for characterizing palaeoseawater composition and palaeoenvironmental change. The potential for conodont apatite to retain primary chemical information depends on crystal size and permeability, so the large albid crystal domains are consistent with parallel geochemical studies that suggest that cancellate albid crown is more resistant to diagenetic modification.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Permian–Triassic mass extinction is the most severe biotic crisis identified in Earth history. Over 90{\%} of marine species were eliminated1,2, causing the destruction of the marine ecosystem structure3. This biotic crisis is generally interpreted as a single extinction event around 252.3 million years ago2,4–6, and has been variously attributed to the eruption of the Siberian Traps or possibly a bolide impact7–10. Here we demonstrate that the marine extinction consisted of two pulses, separated by a 180,000-year recovery phase. We evaluated the range of 537 species representing 17 marine groups in seven Chinese sections froma 450,000-year interval spanning the Permian–Triassic boundary. The first stage of extinction occurred during the latest Permian, and was marked by the extinction of 57{\%} of species, namely all plankton and some benthic groups, including algae, rugose corals, and fusulinids. The second phase occurred in the earliest Triassic, and resulted in the extinction of 71{\%} of the remaining species. This second extinction phase fundamentally altered the marine ecosystem structure that had existed for the previous 200 million years. Because the two pulses showed different extinction selectivity,we conclude that theymay have had different environmental causes.},

The values were measured on bulk carbonate, selected carbonate components and cements. Many of the studied carbonates are interpreted to exhibit primary marine ??13C values with only some showing evidence of diagenetic alteration. A ??13C curve is presented for the entire Devonian time interval. Positive ??13C excursions are documented in the woschmidti-postwoschmidti, sulcatus, kitabicus, Upper serotinus, kockelianus, Middle varcus, falsiovalis, Upper rhenana, linguiformis to Middle triangularis, and Middle to Upper praesulcata conodont Zones. Some excursions are recorded worldwide and interpreted to be of global significance as e.g. at the Silurian-Devonian and Frasnian-Famennian boundaries. Some of the others are described for the first time from Central and Southern Europe, and their global nature has to be verified by further investigations. Most ??13C excursions coincide with sea-level changes and the deposition of black shales. A coupling of changes in sea-level, weathering intensity, nutrient supply, organic carbon production, and climate is assumed as driving force of the carbon isotope excursions. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Paleontological data for the diversity of marine animals and land plants are shown to correlate significantly with a concurrent measure of stable carbon isotope fractionation for approximately the last 400 million years. The correlations can be deduced from the assumption that increasing plant diversity led to increasing chemical weathering of rocks and therefore an increasing flux of carbon from the atmosphere to rocks, and nutrients from the continents to the oceans. The CO(2) concentration dependence of photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation then indicates that the diversification of land plants led to decreasing CO(2) levels, while the diversification of marine animals derived from increasing nutrient availability. Under the explicit assumption that global biodiversity grows with global biomass, the conservation of carbon shows that the long-term fluctuations of CO(2) levels were dominated by complementary changes in the biological and fluid reservoirs of carbon, while the much larger geological reservoir remained relatively constant in size. As a consequence, the paleontological record of biodiversity provides an indirect estimate of the fluctuations of ancient CO(2) levels.},

Across the world, surviving herbaceous lycopsids played a pioneering role in repopulating deforested terrain. We document that the microspores of these lycopsids were regularly released in unseparated tetrads indicative of failure to complete the normal process of spore development. Although involvement of mutation has long been hinted at or proposed in theory, this finding provides concrete evidence for chronic environmental mutagenesis at the time of global ecological crisis. Prolonged exposure to enhanced UV radiation could account satisfactorily for a worldwide increase in land plant mutation. At the end of the Permian, a period of raised UV stress may have been the consequence of severe disruption of the stratospheric ozone balance by excessive emission of hydrothermal organohalogens in the vast area of Siberian Traps volcanism.},

Thus, interpretations of secular trends in the shapes and textures of ancient columnar stromatolites require nonuniformitarian, scale-dependent models of microbial responses to nutrient availability, seawater chemistry, influx of sediment grains, shear, and burial. Models that integrate stromatolite scales,macroscopic organiza- tion, and shapes could also help test the biogenicity of the oldest stromato- lites and other structures whose petrographic fabrics do not preserve direct evidence of microbial activity.

abstract = {A major source of intestinal metabolites results from both host and microbial processing of dietary nutrients. (1)H NMR-based metabolic profiling of mouse feces was carried out over time in different microbiome mouse models, including conventional (n = 9), conventionalized (n = 10), and "humanized" gnotobiotic mice inoculated with a model of human baby microbiota (HBM, n = 17). HBM mice were supplemented with Lactobacillus paracasei with (n = 10) and without (n = 7) prebiotics. Animals not supplemented with prebiotics received a diet enriched in glucose and lactose as placebo. In conventionalized animals, microbial populations and activities converged in term of multivariate mapping toward conventional mice. Both groups decreased bacterial processing of dietary proteins when switching to a diet enriched in glucose and lactose, as described with low levels of 5-aminovalerate, acetate, and propionate and high levels of lysine and arginine. The HBM model differs from conventional and conventionalized microbiota in terms of type, proportion, and metabolic activity of gut bacteria (lower short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), lactate, 5-aminovalerate, and oligosaccharides, higher bile acids and choline). The probiotics supplementation of HBM mice was associated with a specific amino acid pattern that can be linked to L. paracasei proteolytic activities. The combination of L. paracasei with the galactosyl-oligosaccharide prebiotics was related to the enhanced growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, and a specific metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and SCFAs. The present study describes how the assessment of metabolic changes in feces may provide information for studying nutrient-microbiota relationships in different microbiome mouse models.},

abstract = {Carbon cycle disturbance associated with mass extinction at the end of the Permian Period continued through the Early Triassic, an interval of approximately 5 million years. Coincidence of carbon cycle stabilization with accelerated Middle Triassic biotic recovery suggests a link between carbon cycling and biodiversity, but the cause of Early Triassic carbon isotope excursions remains poorly understood. Previous modeling studies have focused exclusively on the initial negative excursion in delta C-13 across the Permian-Triassic boundary and have not addressed the cycles of positive and negative excursions observed through the Early Triassic. This study uses a simple carbon cycle box model to investigate potential causes underlying the series of Early Triassic carbon isotope excursions and to assess possible relationships between isotope excursions and coeval patterns of carbonate deposition. According to the model, introduction of carbon with the isotope composition of volcanic CO2 produces small negative carbon isotope excursions followed by larger and more protracted positive excursions. Positive excursions result because increased pCO(2) causes warming, enhancing marine anoxia and associated regeneration of phosphate and thus allowing greater productivity. In addition, carbonate weathering is more sensitive than organic carbon weathering to changes in atmospheric pCO(2) and climate, causing an increase in the overall delta C-13 Composition of weathered carbon. Therefore, the full Early Triassic record of negative and positive carbon isotope excursions can only be accounted for within the model by several pulses of carbon release characterized by varying mixtures of organic and mantle isotope compositions. Thermal metamorphism of coal and carbonate rocks in the crust of the Siberian craton during eruption of the Siberian Traps flood basalts provides the most plausible mechanism for such a carbon release scenario. If multiple episodes of CO2 release account for Early Triassic carbon cycle instability (regardless of their precise trigger), then cessation of CO2 release is likely to explain acceleration of biotic recovery early in the Middle Triassic.

@article{Anderson2005,
abstract = {Difficulties associated with reconstructing past changes in export production were highlighted recently by Averyt and Paytan (2004), who reported substantial disagreement among records developed using different paleoproductivity proxies extracted from two equatorial Pacific piston cores. Proxies included the accumulation rates of barite, excess Ba, and excess Al, as well as elemental ratios of Al/Ti and Ba/Ti. Here we build upon their work by presenting evidence for two factors that contributed to these discrepancies. First, elemental (Ba/Ti and Al/Ti) ratios are influenced by variability in space and time of the flux of Ti to equatorial Pacific sediments, so these proxies cannot be expected to hold a constant relationship to export production. Second, the late Holocene increase in CaCO3 dissolution has caused concentrations of barite, excess Ba, and excess Al to be enriched in surface sediments relative to the depth interval over which sediment accumulation rates were evaluated in developing the algorithms used by Averyt and Paytan (2004). This produces an error in the accumulation rates of these proxies that varies from core to core, ranging from a few tens of percent to as much as a factor of 3. These errors would have been propagated into the export production algorithms on the basis of fluxes of barite, excess Ba, and excess Al. Furthermore, this bias created by the late Holocene increase in CaCO3 dissolution will affect the development of any algorithm based on fluxes of sedimentary constituents. These factors must be taken into account in future paleoceanographic reconstructions.},

abstract = {This paper critically reviews the state-of-the-art of isotope amount ratio measurements by solution-based multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC ICP-MS) and presents guidelines for corresponding data reduction strategies and uncertainty assessments based on the example of n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) isotope ratios. This ratio shows variation attributable to natural radiogenic processes and mass-dependent fractionation. The applied calibration strategies can display these differences. In addition, a proper statement of uncertainty of measurement, including all relevant influence quantities, is a metrological prerequisite. A detailed instructive procedure for the calculation of combined uncertainties is presented for Sr isotope amount ratios using three different strategies of correction for instrumental isotopic fractionation (IIF): traditional internal correction, standard-sample bracketing, and a combination of both, using Zr as internal standard. Uncertainties are quantified by means of a Kragten spreadsheet approach, including the consideration of correlations between individual input parameters to the model equation. The resulting uncertainties are compared with uncertainties obtained from the partial derivatives approach and Monte Carlo propagation of distributions. We obtain relative expanded uncertainties (U rel; k = 2) of n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) of {\textless} 0.03 {\%}, when normalization values are not propagated. A comprehensive propagation, including certified values and the internal normalization ratio in nature, increases relative expanded uncertainties by about factor two and the correction for IIF becomes the major contributor.},

abstract = {Focusing on the Permian-Triassic boundary, ca. 251 Ma, I explore the possibility that mass extinction can be caused by an extremely fast, explosive release of dissolved methane (and other dissolved gases such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) that accumulated in the oceanic water masses prone to stagnation and anoxia (e.g., in silled basins). The mechanism of the explosive release is the same as in the Lake Nyos disaster of 1986, i.e., a water-column eruption caused by the interplay of buoyancy forces and exsolution of dissolved gas. The eruption brings to the surface deep anoxic waters that cause extinctions in the marine realm. Terrestrial extinctions are caused by explosions and conflagrations that follow the massive release of methane (the air-methane mixture is explosive at methane concentrations between 5{\%} and 15{\%}) and by the eruption-triggered floods. This scenario accounts well for the available data, and may be relevant to other phenomena.},

abstract = {The chemicalevolution of seawater during the Phanerozoic is still a matter of debate. We have assembled and critically analyzed the available data for the composition of fluid inclusions in marine halite and for the mineralogy of marine evaporites. The composition of fluid inclusions in primary marine halite reveals two major long-term cycles in the chemistry of seawater during the past 600 myr. The concentration of Mg2+, Ca2+, and SO42− has varied quite dramatically. The Mg2+ concentration in seawater during most of the early Paleozoic and Jurassic to Cretaceous was as low as 30 to 40 mmol/kg H2O; it reached maximum values ≥50 mmol/kg H2O during the Late Neoproterozoic and Permian. The Ca2+ concentration in seawater during the Phanerozoic has reached maximum values two to three times greater than the concentration in seawater today (10.6 mmol/kg H2O), whereas SO42− concentrations may have been as low as 5 to 10 mmol/kg H2O (a third to a fifth of the modern value) during the Jurassic and Early Paleozoic. The Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio in seawater ranged from 1 to 1.5 during the early to middle Paleozoic and Jurassic-Cretaceous to a near-modern value of 5.2 during the Late Neoproterozoic and Permian. This change in seawater Mg2+/Ca2+ ratio is consistent with the notion of alternating “calcite-aragonite seas” recorded in o{\"{o}}lites and marine carbonate cements. Several models have been proposed to explain the chemicalevolution of seawater. These have invoked significant changes in one or more of the major geochemical processes that control the composition of seawater. The pattern and magnitude of the variations in the composition of seawater proposed in this study are similar to those proposed elsewhere that suggest that seawater fluxes through midocean ridges have played a major role in the evolution of seawater during the past 600 myr. Two Phanerozoic supercycles of the Earth's exogenic processes were recognized in the literature that are caused by mantle convection and plate activity. The composition of seawater has apparently undergone dramatic secular changes in phase with these supercycles and as a consequence of biological evolution. Analyses of fluid inclusions containing unevaporated seawater and a better understanding of the processes that affect the composition of seawater are needed to refine our understanding of the history of Phanerozoicseawater.},

abstract = {The Karoo Supergroup covers almost two thirds of the present land surface of southern Africa. Its strata record an almost continuous sequence of continental sedimentation that began in the Permo-Carboniferous (280 Ma) and terminated in the early Jurassic 100 million years later. The glacio-marine to terrestrial sequence accumulated in a variety of tectonically controlled depositories under progressively more arid climatic conditions. Numerous vertebrate fossils are preserved in these rocks, including fish, amphibians, primitive aquatic reptiles, primitive land reptiles, more advanced mammal-like reptiles, dinosaurs and even the earliest mammals. Palaeoenvironmental analysis of the major stratigraphic units of the Karoo sequence demonstrates the effects of more localised tectonic basins in influencing depositional style. These are superimposed on a basinwide trend of progressive aridification attributed to the gradual northward migration of southwestern Gondwanaland out of polar climes and accentuated by the meteoric drying effect of the surrounding land masses. Combined with progressive climatic drying was a gradual shrinking of the basin brought about by the northward migration of the subducting palaeo-Pacific margin to the south. Following deposition of the Cape Supergroup in the pre-Karoo basin there was a period of uplift and erosion. At the same time the southern part of Gondwana migrated over the South Pole resulting in a major ice-sheet over the early Karoo basin and surrounding highlands. Glacial sedimentation in both upland valley and shelf depositories resulted in the basal Karoo Dwyka Formation. After glaciation, an extensive shallow sea remained over the gently subsiding shelf fed by large volumes of meltwater. Black clays and muds accumulated under relatively cool climatic conditions (Lower Ecca) with perhaps a warmer “interglacial” during which the distinctive Mesosaurus-bearing, carbonaceous shales of the Whitehill Formation were deposited. Deformation of the southern rim of the basin, caused by the subducting palaeo-Pacific plate, resulted in mountain ranges far to the south. Material derived from this source, as well as granitic uplands to the west and morth-east, was deposited on large deltas that built out into the Ecca sea (Upper Ecca). The relatively cool climate and lowland setting promoted thick accumulations of peat on the coastal and delta plains and which now constitute the major coal reserves of southern Africa. Later the prograding deltas coalesced to fill most of the basin after which fluvial sedimentation of the Beaufort Group dominated. The climate by this time (Late Permian) had warmed to become semi-arid with highly seasonal rainfall. The central parts of the basin were for the most part drained by fine-grained meanderbelts and semi-permanent lakes. Significant stratabound uranium reserves have been delimited in the channel sandstones of the Beaufort Group in the southwestern parts of the basin. Pulses of uplift in the southern source areas combined with a possible orogenic effect resulted in two coarser-grained alluvial fans prograding into the more central parts of the basin (Katberg Sandstone Member and Molteno Formation). In the upper Karoo sequence progressive aridification dominated depositional style with playa lake and wadi-type environments (Elliot Formation) that finally gave way to a dune sand dominated system (Clarens Formation). Basinwide volcanic activity of the early Jurassic Drakensberg Group brought deposition in the Karoo Basin to a close. Le supergroupe du Karoo couvre presque les deux tiers de la surface continentale actuelle de l'Afrique du Sud et ses strates repr{\'{e}}sentent une s{\'{e}}quence presque continue de s{\'{e}}dimentation continentale depuis le Permo-Carbonif{\`{e}}re (280 Ma) jusqu'au d{\'{e}}but du Jurassique, 100 millions d'ann{\'{e}}es plus tard.

Cet ass{\`{e}}chement climatique progressif s'est trouv{\'{e}} combin{\'{e}} avec un r{\'{e}}tr{\'{e}}cissement graduel du bassin d{\^{u}} {\`{a}} la migration vers le nord de la zone de subduction de la plaque pal{\'{e}}o-Pacifique qui constituait sa marge m{\'{e}}ridionale. Apr{\`{e}}s le d{\'{e}}p{\^{o}}t du supergroupe du Cap dans le bassin pr{\'{e}}-Karoo, il y eut une p{\'{e}}riode de soul{\`{e}}vement et d'{\'{e}}rosion. A la m{\^{e}}me {\'{e}}poque la partie m{\'{e}}ridionale du continent de Gondwana se d{\'{e}}pla{\c{c}}ait par-del{\`{a}} le p{\^{o}}le sud, ce qui provoque le d{\'{e}}veloppement d'une immense nappe glaciaire sur le bassin de Karoo naissant et sur les hauteurs environnantes. La s{\'{e}}dimentation glaciaire dans les vall{\'{e}}es montagneuses et sur la plate-forme continentale aboutit {\`{a}} la Formation {\`{a}} la base de la Formation du Karoo. Apr{\'{e}}s la glaciation sur la plate-forme continentale soumise {\`{a}} une faible subsidence, une mer bordi{\`{e}}re {\'{e}}tendue subsista, abondamment nourrie par les eaux de fonte. Des argiles et boues noires s'accumul{\`{e}}rent alors sous des conditions climatiques relativement froides (Ecca inf{\'{e}}rieur), avec peut-{\^{e}}tre un “interglaciaire” plus chaud durant lequel se d{\'{e}}pos{\`{e}}rent les shales carbonat{\'{e}}es {\`{a}} Mesosaurus de la Formation de Whitehill. La d{\'{e}}formation du rebord sud du bassin, provoqu{\'{e}}e par la subduction de la plaque pal{\'{e}}o-Pacifique, aboutit {\`{a}} la formation de cha{\^{i}}nes montagneuses loin au sud. Le mat{\'{e}}riel provenant de cette source ainsi que des hauteurs granitiques de l'ouest et du nord-est se d{\'{e}}pose sur les vastes deltas qui s'{\'{e}}difi{\`{e}}rent dans lam mer d'Ecca (Ecca sup{\'{e}}rieur). Le climate relativement froid et la faible altitude entra{\^{i}}n{\`{e}}rent alors d'{\'{e}}paisses accumulations de tourbe sur les plaines c{\^{o}}ti{\`{e}}res et delta{\"{i}}ques, qui constituent actuellement les plus grandes r{\'{e}}serves de charbon de l'Afrique m{\'{e}}ridionale. Plus tard, des deltas connurent une progradation telle que leur coalescence combla la plus grande partie du bassin, apr{\`{e}}s quoi la s{\'{e}}dimentation fluviatile domina la formation du groupe de Beaufort. A cette {\'{e}}poque (Permien sup{\'{e}}rieur) le climat s'{\'{e}}tait r{\'{e}}chauff{\'{e}} pour devenir semi-aride avec des pr{\'{e}}cipitations fortement saisonni{\'{e}}res. Les parties centrales du bassin furent pour la plupart drain{\'{e}}es par des ceintures de m{\'{e}}andres {\`{a}} s{\'{e}}diments fins et par des lacs semi-permanents. Des r{\'{e}}serves significatives d'uranium s{\'{e}}dimentaire se sont trouv{\'{e}}es d{\'{e}}limit{\'{e}}es dans le gr{\`{e}}s des chenaux du groupe de Beaufort dans le sud-ouest du bassin. Des pulsations de soul{\`{e}}vement dans les zones d'alimentation m{\'{e}}ridionales, combin{\'{e}}es avec un possible effet orog{\'{e}}nique, provoqu{\`{e}}rent la progradation de deux c{\^{o}}nes alluviaux {\`{a}} s{\'{e}}dimentation grossi{\`{e}}re dans les parties plus centrales du bassin (Katberg Sandstone Member et Molteno Formation).

abstract = {The cosmopolitan, bloom-forming diatom, Skeletonema costatum, is a prominent primary producer in coastal oceans, fixing CO2 with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) that is phylogenetically distinct from terrestrial plant RubisCO. RubisCOs are subdivided into groups based on sequence similarity of their large subunits (IA-ID, II, and III). ID is present in several major oceanic primary producers, including diatoms such as S. costatum, coccolithophores, and some dinoflagellates, and differs substantially in amino acid sequence from the well-studied IB enzymes present in most cyanobacteria and in green algae and plants. Despite this sequence divergence, and differences in isotopic discrimination apparent in other RubisCO enzymes, stable carbon isotope compositions of diatoms and other marine phytoplankton are generally interpreted assuming enzymatic isotopic discrimination similar to spinach RubisCO (IB). To interpret phytoplankton $\delta$(13) C values, S. costatum RubisCO was characterized via sequence analysis, and measurement of its KCO2 and Vmax , and degree of isotopic discrimination. The sequence of this enzyme placed it among other diatom ID RubisCOs. Michaelis-Menten parameters were similar to other ID enzymes (KCO2 = 48.9 ± 2.8 $\mu$m; Vmax = 165.1 ± 6.3 nmol min(-1 ) mg(-1) ). However, isotopic discrimination ($\epsilon$ = [(12) k/(13) k - 1] × 1000) was low (18.5‰; 17.0-19.9, 95{\%} CI) when compared to IA and IB RubisCOs (22-29‰), though not as low as ID from coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi (11.1‰). Variability in $\epsilon$-values among RubisCOs from primary producers is likely reflected in $\delta$(13) C values of oceanic biomass. Currently, $\delta$(13) C variability is ascribed to physical or chemical factors (e.g. illumination, nutrient availability) and physiological responses to these factors (e.g. carbon-concentrating mechanisms). Estimating the importance of these factors from $\delta$(13) C measurements requires an accurate $\epsilon$-value, and a mass-balance model using the $\epsilon$-value for S. costatum RubisCO is presented. Clearly, appropriate $\epsilon$-values must be included in interpreting $\delta$(13) C values of environmental samples.},

abstract = {Analyses were made of a mollusc-based meta dataset of 859 $\delta$ 13 C and $\delta$ 18 O data of Miocene nearshore settings in the European Paratethys Sea and its descendant Lake Pannon. The observed trends document a strong tie to geodynamics, which are largely decoupled from Miocene open ocean isotope curves. Semi- to fully enclosed, initially marine water bodies such as the Paratethys Sea are prone to switching seawater isotope signatures because they respond rapidly to changes in the evaporation/precipitation ratio. Two phases of positive deviations of oxygen isotope values of water (relative to the modern ocean value, SMOW) occurred during the Middle Miocene; both were initiated by tectonic constrictions of the seaways and became amplified by global warming and regionally decreasing precipitation. With the final disintegration of the Paratethys, the marine isotope signatures vanish. Instead, the observed isotope trends suggest a comparably simple system of an alkaline lake with steadily declining salinity. The 'ocean-derived' Paratethys Sea may thus act as a key for understanding isotope trends in epicontinental seas. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Aqueous Fe(II) is known to catalyze the abiotic transformation of ferrihydrite to more stable Fe minerals. However, little is known about the impacts of coprecipitated OM on Fe(II)-catalyzed ferrihydrite transformation and its consequences for C dynamics. Accordingly, we investigated the extent and pathway of Fe(II)-induced transformation of OM-ferrihydrite coprecipitates as a function of C/Fe ratios and aqueous Fe(II) concentrations, and its implications for subsequent C dynamics. The coprecipitated OM resulted in a linear decrease in ferrihydrite transformation with increasing C/Fe ratios. The secondary mineral profiles upon Fe(II) reaction with OM-ferrihydrite coprecipitates depend on Fe(II) concentrations At 0.2 mM Fe(II), OM completely inhibited goethite formation and stimulated lepidocrocite formation. At 2 mM Fe(II), whereas goethite was formed in the presence of OM, OM reduced the amount of goethite and magnetite formation and increased the formation of lepidocrocite. The solid-phase C content remained unchanged after reaction, suggesting that OM remains associated with Fe minerals following ferrihydrite transformation to more stable Fe minerals. However, C desorbability by H2PO4(-) from the resulting Fe minerals following reaction was enhanced. The study indicates a "lepidocrocite favoring effect" by OM and suggests that Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite may decrease OM stability in natural environments under moderately reducing conditions.},

abstract = {The most important Eurasian sections, where the transitional Permian/Triassic boundary beds are characterized palaeontologically, are found in the Germanic Basin (West European platform), Moscow Basin (East European platform), Tungusska Basin (Siberian platform), Jimsar Basin, Dalongkou area (Tianshan Mountains), and Noyan Somon depression (Mongolia). Usually the Permian and Triassic continental formations formed under distinct palaeogeographic (especially climatic) and palaeotectonic conditions, so the lithological and sedimentological differences between them are pronounced. Difficult problems appear in those regions where the sedimentation at this level proceeded under very similar conditions (Tungusska Basin, Jimsar Basin) across the Permo-Triassic boundary (PTB). Among palaeontological data, the most important for correlation of these continental beds is the tetrapod fauna. Broad interchange between the tetrapod fauna of the Old World continents resulted in the wide distribution during the Late Permian and Early Triassic of common or closely related forms, which enables distant correlations. The PTB is marked by the change of the Late Permian tetrapod communities, dominated by the large herbivore Dicynodon (or closely allied forms), to assemblages that include Lystrosaurus as the most common form. This is recorded in Lower Triassic beds of Eastern Europe, China, Mongolia, India and Siberia. The Upper Permian sporomorph associations (sa) are dominated by striate bissacate pollen, whereas the early Lower Triassic ones are distinguished by the very important role of spores, primarily by cavate trilete (Lundbladispora, Densoisporites) and also by non-striate dissacate (Klausipollenites) and teniate pollen (Lunatisporites). In the oldest horizons of the Triassic, very distinctive species of conchostracans (Falsisca eotriassica Kozur or the closely related form F. verhojanica Molin) appear. The PTB is within a normal polarity zone, formerly considered the lowest palaeomagnetic zone of the Triassic. The boundary beds of two sections (Moscow Basin and Jimsar Basin) may be equally worthy as candidates for the PTB GSSP in the continental series. The preference should be given to the section better characterized and internationally accessible to scientists. The PTB generally accepted for the continental series coincides more or less with the base of the Otoceras concavum ammonite zone of the Boreal province, and with the base of the boundary clay in Tethys. At the same time, it lies clearly below the traditionally adopted PTB in marine sequences at the base of the Otoceras woodwardi zone and also below the First Appearance Datum (FAD) of I. parva in the Meishan section, proposed now as the PTB GSSP (Yin, 1996, The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic Boundary Candidate of Global Stratotype Section and Point of the Permian-Triassic Boundary, China University Geoscience Press, Wuhan, 137 pp.). This demonstrates that the FAD of I. parva can be asynchronous (see Baud, 1996, Albertiana 18, pp. 6-9). That is why in the choice of the PTB GSSP in the marine series it is necessary to take into consideration the generally accepted point of view on the position of PTB in the continental series.},

Protons constitute the critical link: Calcification generates protons, which plants and photosynthetic symbioses use to assimilate bicarbonate and nutrients. A calcium ATPase-based "trans" mechanism underlies most biological calcification. This permits high calcium carbonate supersaturations and rapid carbonate precipitation. The competitive advantages of calcification become especially apparent in light and nutrient-deficient alkaline environments. Calcareous plants often dominate the lower euphotic zone in both the benthos and the plankton. Geographically and seasonally, massive calcification concentrates in nutrient-deficient environments including alkaline soils, coral reefs, cyanobacterial mats and coccolithophorid blooms. Structural and defensive uses for calcareous skeletons are sometimes overrated.},

abstract = {The biogeochemical cycles of iron and organic carbon are strongly interlinked. In oceanic waters, organic ligands have been shown to control the concentration of dissolved iron1. In soils, solid iron phases shelter and preserve organic carbon2, but the role of iron in the preservation of organic matter in sediments has not been clearly established. Here we use an iron reduction method previously applied to soils3 to determine the amount of organic carbon associated with reactive iron phases in sediments of various mineralogies collected from a wide range of depositional environments. Our findings suggest that 21.5 ± 8.6 per cent of the organic carbon in sediments is directly bound to reactive iron phases. We further estimate that a global mass of (19–45) × 1015 grams of organic carbon is preserved in surface marine sediments as a result of its association with iron4. We propose that these associations between organic carbon and iron, which are formed primarily through co-precipitation and/or direct chelation, promote the preservation of organic carbon in sediments. Because reactive iron phases are metastable over geological timescales, we suggest that they serve as an efficient ‘rusty sink' for organic carbon, acting as a key factor in the long-term storage of organic carbon and thus contributing to the global cycles of carbon, oxygen and sulphur.},

Combined with results on delta(15)N of bulk sediment, organic carbon concentrations, and abundances of exoskeletons of Bosmina longispina maritima in the sediment, the data are used to evaluate significant sources of nitrogen in the food web over the past century. Nitrogen isotopic composition of bulk sediments ranges from 2.5 to 4.5 parts per thousand, that of exokeletons varies between 0.4 and 6.2 parts per thousand. The two are positively correlated. A marked increase in the abundance of Bosmina since 1965 (from less than 500 specimen to more than 5000 specimen cm(3) of sediment) is correlated with a significant increase in sedimentary organic carbon concentrations (from 4{\%} to more than 10{\%}). The isotopic data do not identify increased land-derived nitrate as the dominant nitrogen source fuelling the increase. Instead, we postulate that nitrogen fixation by diazotrophic bacteria has been one of the larger sources of nitrogen in the Bal tic Sea, as it is today},

abstract = {During Permian stage 6 (Wordian, Kazanian) the Pangaean supercontinent was surrounded by a superocean: Panthalassa. An ocean general circulation model has been coupled to an atmospheric energy balance model to simulate the sensitivity of the Wordian climate (鈭?65 million years ago) to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations, high-latitude geography, and Earth orbital configurations. The model simulates significantly different circulation features with different levels of greenhouse gas forcing, ranging from a strong meridional overturning circulation in the Southern Hemisphere at low CO2 concentration (present level) to more symmetric overturning circulation cells with deep water formation in polar latitudes of both hemispheres at high CO2 concentration (8 times present level). The simulated climate with 4 times present level CO2 concentration agrees generally well with climate-sensitive sediments and phytogeographic patterns. The model simulates strong subtropical gyres with similarities to the modern South Pacific circulation and moderate surface temperatures on the southern continent Gondwana, resulting from a strong poleward heat transport in the ocean. An even more moderate climate is generated if high-latitude land is removed from the southern continent so that ocean currents can penetrate into the polar regions of Gondwana.},

abstract = {About 75{\%} of extant sponge species use dissolved silicon (DSi) to build a siliceous skeleton. We show that silicon (Si) uptake by sublittoral Axinella demosponges follows an enzymatic kinetics. Interestingly, maximum uptake efficiency occurs at experimental DSi concentrations two orders of magnitude higher than those in the sponge habitats, being unachievable in coastal waters of modern oceans. Such uptake performance appears to be rooted in a former condition suitable to operate at the seemingly high DSi values characterizing the pre-Tertiary ({\textgreater}65 mya) habitats where this sponge lineage diversified. Persistence of ancestral uptake systems causes sponges to be outcompeted by the more efficient uptake of diatoms at the low ambient DSi levels characterizing Recent oceans. Yet, we show that sublittoral sponges consume substantial coastal DSi (0.01-0.90 mmol Si m(-2) day(-1)) at the expenses of the primary-production circuit. Neglect of that consumption hampers accurate understanding of Si cycling on continental margins.},

abstract = {One hundred fifty-six biogenic calcites and 96 whole rock carbonate samples of Paleozoic and Mesozoic age have been analysed for their sulfur isotopic composition. Recorded in structurally substituted sulfate (SSS) in the calcite lattice, the sulfur isotopic composition is thought to reflect the sulfur isotope value of ambient seawater sulfate. Possible alterations of the signal have been assessed, confirming the validity of this approach and the reliability of the resulting temporal record. The new sulfur isotope data substantially enhances our knowledge about secular variations of the global sulfur cycle during the Phanerozoic. Specifically for the Paleozoic, 177 new measurements of SSS in stratigraphically well-constrained samples provide a coherent and detailed dataset. This is extended through the entire Mesozoic via 75 measurements of delta34SSSS, largely for biogenic calcites. Long-term changes and short-term oscillations in the sulfur isotopic composition of seawater sulfate have been observed, which are thought to reflect changes in the fractional burial of sulfide sulfur. Our new sulfur isotope data measured for structurally substituted sulfate in carbonates, and additional data from Cenozoic foraminifera and marine barites, provide a new temporal record for the sulfur isotopic composition of Phanerozoic seawater sulfate. This new record is superior in its continuity and time resolution to currently available datasets and should replace them in future considerations of Earth System Evolution.},

abstract = {New biogeochemical data redefined the position of the Permian−Triassic boundary (PTB) in the Velebit Mt., Croatia, previously positioned at the lithological boundary, and indicate two stress events. Pronounced enrichment in REE concentrations, negative Ce anomaly, negative shift in $\delta$13Cker values and disappearance of microfossils coincide with the occurrence of ooids, marking the first stress event, most probably the Late Permian regression. The second event is the PTB, with the well known negative shift in $\delta$13Ccarb from +1.4 to −0.6‰ (VPDB; P: −0.8 to +2‰; Tr: −1.3 to +0.9‰) and biota impoverishment. The $\delta$13Cker values at PTB are ∼−27.1‰, P: −27.3 to −24.4‰, and Tr: −29.1 to −26.4‰. The $\delta$15Nker values show a preferential marine influence during the Late Permian ({\~{}}7‰) before the regression phase, and enhanced terrestrial influence towards the PTB with presence of cyanobacteria (−2 to +4‰), which seems to be the only surviving taxa. Long chained n-alkanes (C17−C31, max. C26), with even/odd predominance are probably derived from the freshwater green microalga Botryococcus braunii, indicating lagoonal-type environment. The C17/C18 ratios show a stronger algal influence during Early Triassic. Prystane and phytane are present in most samples and they can be derived from chlorophyll in algae and cyanobacteria. The distribution of n-alkylcyclohexanes (C17−C24, max. C21) with even/odd predominance indicate a bacterial biomass contribution. Values of Pr/Ph ratio are mostly {\textless}1, probably indicating anoxic conditions. Hopanes, the prokaryota biomarkers, have been identified in almost all samples (C29 to C32), while steranes, biomarkers of eukaryotic organisms, have been found mostly in small abundances, in the range dia-C27 to ste- C29, usually maximizing at ste-C27, indicating marine input.},

In this section changes in the sedimentary environment are most probably related to Upper Permian-Lower Triassic sea level changes. The carbonate and organic carbon negative peak anomaly could be explained by accelerated changes in the end Permian carbon cycle, due to some co-occurring events, such as pronounced erosion and oxidation of organic carbon, a possible release of methane from stored hydrates, and volcanic activity, as well as by a sudden reduction in primary productivity triggered by not yet completely satisfactorily explained mechanisms.},

The correlations on which the composite section is based show complete agreement between lake level cycles and independent magnetic polarity boundary isochrons. The main proxy of lake level and hence climate used to construct this lake level curve is a classification of water-depth related sedimentary structures and fabrics called depth ranks. We then use Fourier frequency analysis (both FFT and multitaper methods) and joint time-frequency approaches to resolve the periodic properties of the cyclicity and the secular drift in those properties. A consistent hierarchy in frequencies of the lake level cycles is present throughout the Late Triassic (and earliest Jurassic) portions of the cores, an interval of about 22 m.y.. Calibration of the sediment accumulation rate by a variety of methods shows that these thickness periodicities are consistent with an origin in changes in precipitation governed by celestial mechanics. The full range of precession-related periods of lake level change are present, including the two peaks of the {\~{}}20,000 year cycle of climatic precession, the two peaks of the {\~{}}100,000 year eccentricity cycle, the single peak of the 412,900 year eccentricity cycle, and the {\~{}}2,000,000 year eccentricity cycle. There is also good correspondence in the details of the joint-time frequency properties of lake level cycles and astronomical predictions as well. Even in an ice-free world, the tropical climate of Pangaea responded strongly to astronomical forcing, suggesting that precession-dominated climatic forcing probably always has been a prominent feature of tropical climate.},

abstract = {High precision oxygen isotope analyses were made of phosphate extracted from 17 samples of nektonic and benthic fish debris sampled across the stratigraphic Cretaceous—Tertiary boundary in northern Morocco. A refinement of the silver phosphate method was used to isolate phosphate from biogenic materials. Measured $\delta$18O values of 18.6–20.5‰ are interpreted as reflecting high-resolution thermal variations that affected the ocean water column of the western Tethys. The warm (27°C) water masses that characterized Maastrichtian times underwent rapid cooling and stabilized at an average temperature of 19°C during the Dano-Montian and Thanetian. This period of constant and cool temperature was followed by a relatively rapid but more gradual warming to about 25°C achieved in the Middle Ypresian. Significant small shifts in $\delta$18O values between nektonic and benthic fauna recorded only during the stages of rapid warming or cooling may correspond to averaged thermal differences within the water column that developed in response to global climatic changes. The indicated temperature distribution could have been caused by thermal changes in the atmosphere rather than some signal carried by deep ocean currents. The oxygen isotope data coupled with previous measurements of REE and ϵNd(T) on the same samples support the suggestion that paleo-Pacific westward currents progressed as far as the northwestern part of the African platform at the end of the Cretaceous period.},

@article{Kidder2010,
abstract = {The Phanerozoic consists of three mutually exclusive climate states: Icehouse, Greenhouse, and Hothouse. The Greenhouse is the default state, representing {\textgreater} 70{\%} of the Phanerozoic. It is characterized by a weak thermal mode (pole-driven deep-water formation), with little or no continental sea ice, and weakly oxic cool-water sinking near the poles. Nitrogen limitation characterizes Greenhouse oceans in which ammonium may be the dominant bioavailable form of nitrogen. The steady-state Greenhouse default must be forced to produce either of the other two states.Continent-continent collision produces the intense chemical weathering that draws down atmospheric CO2 and results in the Icehouse state that comprises 20-25{\%} of the Phanerozoic. Icehouses have ice caps in contact with the ocean that produce icebergs and foster sea-ice formation. Sea-ice formation fills the ocean with highly oxic phosphorus-limited icewater except for a thin layer of warm surface water in the tropics. Of the 23 most conspicuous mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic (including the late Ediacaran), 4 are associated with ice-volume-related regressions, and 3 are problematic. We suggest that the other 16 mass extinctions occurred when Greenhouse climate was forced to Hothouse climate.Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) can trigger the HEATT (Haline Euxinic Acidic Thermal Transgression) mechanism, which can force Greenhouse climate to a Hothouse climate state. The rapid, voluminous CO2 emissions of LIPs cause a series of events that result in very slow but pronounced haline-mode circulation (mid-latitude-driven deep-water formation) that produces warm saline bottom water at very dry, hot subtropical and middle latitudes. This water upwells at the poles, causing warm and moist equable climate. Hothouse development promotes deep-sea anoxia that is generated in concert with CO2 buildup and warming. The spread of anoxia favors reduced nitrogen over nitrate, and limited iron dust curtails nitrogen fixation. This leads to dominance of primary productivity by primitive green algae and/or cyanobacteria. Progression to euxinia that reaches the photic zone severely curtails primary productivity via poisoning, even as availability of usable nitrogen plummets. The result is eukaryotic mass extinction. We suggest that the 16 Phanerozoic mass extinctions referred to above resulted at least in part from the HEATT process. Evidence for this relationship at 11 of the most severe extinctions is convincing. Data sets for the other 5 are strongly suggestive of HEATT-related mass extinction, but do not yet have enough documentation to reliably characterize them as HEATT episodes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Several commonly used paleoproductivity proxies were compared to evaluate the validity of assumptions and limitations associated with each proxy. Export production fluxes (Cexport) over glacial-interglacial timescales were calculated from previously developed, proxy-specific algorithms at TTN013-pc72 and TTN013-pc114, both located in the equatorial Pacific. Comparison of data from the same core intervals yields conflicting results despite calibrations based on the same core top samples. The periodicity of marine barite, excess Ba, and excess Al-based Cexport records is similar. The relative magnitude of Cexport when calculated using excess Ba and algorithms based on sediment trap data is significantly different than records based on core top calibrations, particularly during glacial intervals. At both sites, bulk sedimentary Al/Ti and Ba/Ti ratios covary; however, these ratios do not correspond with the downcore records of their respective excess concentrations (and their accumulation rates), or with contemporaneous records based on marine barite, excess Ba, and excess Al accumulation. Although downcore records based on sediment mass accumulation rates may be compromised by sediment focusing, this process cannot explain all the differences observed among the various data sets presented here. This implies that some or all of these proxies do not exclusively respond to changes in export production. The contradictions among these data highlight the importance of addressing inconsistencies among paleoproxies and re-examining assumptions imbedded in proxy fundamentals, prior to applying paleoproductivity proxies and interpreting paleoceanographic records.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic extinction pattern in the peri-Gondwanan region is documented biostratigraphically, geochemically and sedimentologically based on three marine sequences deposited in southern Tibet and comparisons with the sections in the Salt Range, Pakistan and Kashmir. Results of biostratigraphical ranges for the marine faunas reveal an end-Permian event comparable in timing with that known at the Meishan section in low palaeolatitude as well as Spitsbergen and East Greenland in northern Boreal settings although biotic patterns earlier in the Permian vary. The previously interpreted delayed extinction (Late Griesbachian) at the Selong Xishan section is not supported by our analysis. The end-Permian event exhibits an abrupt marine faunal shift slightly beneath the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) from benthic taxa- to nektic taxa-dominated communities. The climate along the continental margin of Neo-Tethys was cold before the extinction event. However, a rapid climatic warming event as indicated by the southward invasion of abundant warm-water conodonts, warm-water brachiopods, calcareous sponges, and gastropods was associated with the extinction event. Stable isotopic values of $\delta$13Ccarb, $\delta$13Corg and $\delta$18O show a sharp negative drop slightly before and during the extinction interval. Sedimentological and microstratigraphical analysis reveals a Late Permian regression, as marked by a Caliche Bed at the Selong Xishan section and the micaceous siltstone in the topmost part of the Qubuerga Formation at the Qubu and Tulong sections. The regression was immediately followed by a rapid transgression beneath the PTB. The basal Triassic rocks fine upward, and are dominated by dolomitic packstone/wackestone containing pyritic cubes, bioturbation and numerous tiny foraminifers, suggesting that the studied sections were deposited during the initial stage of the transgression and hence may not have been deeply affected by the anoxic event that is widely believed to characterise the zenith of the transgression. {\textcopyright} 2006 Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS.},

abstract = {We have examined the relative affinity of Th, Pa and Be for sorption from seawater onto particles of variable composition (opal, carbonate, lithogenic particles and organic carbon). Nuclide concentrations in particles collected from time-series sediment traps were normalized by the dissolved nuclide concentration in the overlying water column in order to compute partition coefficients under conditions spanning a wide range of particle flux and particle composition. Our results suggest that the affinity of particles for Pa and Be increases with their increasing opal content and decreasing carbonate content, while the affinity of particles for Th increases with increasing carbonate content, and decreases with increasing opal content. We find no correlation between the aluminosilicate content of particles and their affinity for scavenging of any of these elements. Extrapolating to a pure CaCO3end member, the partition coefficient for Th (9.0 X 106g g-1) is ∼40 times greater than for Pa, and roughly 100 times greater than for Be, whereas for a pure opal end member, the partition coefficient for Th (3.9 X 105g g-1)is slightly less than that for Pa and Be. Partition coefficients decrease with increasing particle flux in open-ocean settings, but not in an ocean-margin region. This kinetic effect reflects the increasing contribution of unaltered surface material reaching the sediment traps as particle flux increases. The degree of fractionation between Pa and Th and between Be and Th depends on the opal:carbonate rain ratio. These results challenge the use of sedimentary231Pa/230Th and10Be/230Th ratios as simple proxies of particle flux. However, the strong dependence of nuclide scavenging on the opal:carbonate rain ratio may provide a needed tool for reconstructing past changes in planktonic community composition. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Measurements of Sr/Ca of benthic foraminifera show a linear decrease with water depth which is superimposed upon significant variability identified by analyses of individual foraminifera. New data for Cd/Ca support previous work in defining a contrast between waters shallower and deeper than similar to 2500 m. Measured element partition coefficients in foraminiferal calcium carbonate relative to sea water (D) have been described by means of a one-box model in which elements are extracted by Rayleigh distillation from a biomineralization reservoir that serves for calcification with a constant fractionation factor (alpha), such that D = (1 - f(alpha))/(1 - f), where f is the proportion of Ca remaining after precipitation. A modification to the model recognises differences in element speciation. The model is consistent with differences between D-Sr, D-Ba and D-Cd in benthic but not planktonic foraminifera. Depth variations in D for Sr and Ba are consistent with the model, as are differences in depth variation of D, in calcitic and aragonitic benthic foraminifera. The shallower depth variations may reflect increasing calcification rates with increasing water depth to an optimum of about 2500 m. Observations of unusually lower D-Cd for some deep waters, not accompanied by similar D-Sr or D-Ba, may be because of dissolution or a calcification response to a lower carbonate saturation state.},

abstract = {Calcium carbonate precipitation and microbialite formation at highly supersaturated mixing zones of thermal spring waters and alkaline lake water have been investigated at Pyramid Lake, Nevada. Without precipitation, pure mixing should lead to a nearly 100-fold supersaturation at 40°C. Physicochemical precipitation is modified or even inhibited by the properties of biofilms, dependent on the extent of biofilm development and the current precipitation rate. Mucus substances (extracellular polymeric substances, EPS, e.g., of cyanobacteria) serve as effective Ca2+-buffers, thus preventing seed crystal nucleation even in a highly supersaturated macroenvironment. Carbonate is then preferentially precipitated in mucus-free areas such as empty diatom tests or voids. After the buffer capacity of the EPS is surpassed, precipitation is observed at the margins of mucus areas. Hydrocarbon biomarkers extracted from (1) a calcifying Phormidium-biofilm, (2) the stromatolitic carbonate below, and (3) a fossil 'tufa' of the Pleistocene pinnacles, indicate that the cyanobacterial primary producers have been subject to significant temporal changes in their species distribution. Accordingly, the species composition of cyanobacterial biofilms does not appear to be relevant for the formation of microbial carbonates in Pyramid Lake. The results demonstrates the crucial influence of mucus substances on carbonate precipitation in highly supersaturated natural environments.},

abstract = {The mineralogy of terrestrial planets evolves as a consequence of a range of physical, chemical, and biological processes. In pre-stellar molecular clouds, widely dispersed microscopic dust particles contain approximately a dozen refractory minerals that represent the starting point of planetary mineral evolution. Gravitational clumping into a protoplanetary disk, star formation, and the resultant heating in the stellar nebula produce primary refractory constituents of chondritic meteorites, including chondrules and calcium-aluminum inclusions, with {\~{}}60 different mineral phases. Subsequent aqueous and thermal alteration of chondrites, asteroidal accretion and differentiation, and the consequent formation of achondrites results in a mineralogical repertoire limited to {\~{}}250 different minerals found in unweathered meteorite samples. Following planetary accretion and differentiation, the initial mineral evolution of Earth's crust depended on a sequence of geochemical and petrologic processes, including volcanism and degassing, fractional crystallization, crystal settling, assimilation reactions, regional and contact metamorphism, plate tectonics, and associated large-scale fluid-rock interactions. These processes produced the first continents with their associated granitoids and pegmatites, hydrothermal ore deposits, metamorphic terrains, evaporites, and zones of surface weathering, and resulted in an estimated 1500 different mineral species. According to some origin-of-life scenarios, a planet must progress through at least some of these stages of chemical processing as a prerequisite for life. Biological processes began to affect Earth's surface mineralogy by the Eoarchean Era ({\~{}}3.85-3.6 Ga), when large-scale surface mineral deposits, including banded iron formations, were precipitated under the influences of changing atmospheric and ocean chemistry. The Paleoproterozoic “Great Oxidation Event” ({\~{}}2.2 to 2.0 Ga), when atmospheric oxygen may have risen to {\textgreater}1{\%} of modern levels, and the Neoproterozoic increase in atmospheric oxygen, which followed several major glaciation events, ultimately gave rise to multicellular life and skeletal biomineralization and irreversibly transformed Earth's surface mineralogy. Biochemical processes may thus be responsible, directly or indirectly, for most of Earth's 4300 known mineral species. The stages of mineral evolution arise from three primary mechanisms: (1) the progressive separation and concentration of the elements from their original relatively uniform distribution in the pre-solar nebula; (2) an increase in range of intensive variables such as pressure, temperature, and the activities of H2O, CO2, and O2; and (3) the generation of far-from-equilibrium conditions by living systems. The sequential evolution of Earth's mineralogy from chondritic simplicity to Phanerozoic complexity introduces the dimension of geologic time to mineralogy and thus provides a dynamic alternate approach to framing, and to teaching, the mineral sciences.},

abstract = {A quantitative investigation of the ecological changes of shallow-marine benthos was undertaken at the Permian–Triassic boundary section at Zhongzhai, South China. The studied fossil material primarily included brachiopods and bivalves owing to their abundance throughout the section, but other subordinate taxonomic groups including ostracods and microgastropods were also integrated for discussion. Overall, a succession of three benthonic paleocommunities was recognized representing three connected ecological evolutionary stages across the Permian–Triassic transition. Both Stage 1 and Stage 2 paleocommunities predated the end-Permian boundary mass extinction, and were characterized by relatively high diversity of brachiopods and bivalves, with no or very rare other taxa. Approaching the end-Permian mass extinction and the PTB itself, the paleocommunity abruptly changed and was replaced by the Stage 2 paleocommunity that was characterized by a relatively low Shannon's diversity (H) coupled with a high Simpson's dominance index (D) and, most notably, a changeover from Neochonetes to Tethyochonetes (both are brachiopod genera) as the most significant ecological dominants. This Simpson's dominance index (D) shift correlates well with food shortage (i.e. much reduced terrestrial influx and acritarch abundance), and is therefore interpreted to signify, possibly, intensified interspecific competitions with Tethyochonetes seemingly outcompeting Neochonetes presumably due to its preadapted smaller body size. The post-extinction (Stage 3) paleocommunity is distinguished by a highly characteristic low-diversity and high-abundance fauna comprised mainly of lingulid brachiopods, Claraia bivalves, microgastropods and ostracods, suggesting a unique and highly stressful ecological regime. In this paleocommunity, Claraia might have acted like a “disaster taxon” and, as such, its ecological functional role in the paleocommunity was activated and elevated because of exceptional ecological conditions (e.g., anoxia, hyperthermal and/or severe food shortage). From the studied section, a number of ecological traits including species abundance distribution, Shannon's diversity (H), community dominance and body-size structure were identified as demonstrating significant changes accompanying community replacement prior to the end-Permian mass extinction. The fact that these changes preceded the mass extinction may suggest that these traits could represent some early warning signals for an impending ecological regime shift. This extended interpretation clearly has significant implications for modern ecological studies to predict future impending ecological regime shifts.},

abstract = {Sedimentary S cycling is usually conceptualized and interpreted within the context of steadily accreting (1-D) transport-reaction regimes. Unsteady processes, however, are common in many sedimentary systems and can result in dramatically different S reaction balances and diagenetic products than steady conditions. Globally important common examples include tropical deltaic topset and inner shelf muds such as those extending from the Amazon River ???1600km along the Guianas coast of South America. These deposits are characterized by episodic reworking of the surface seabed over vertical depths of ???0.1-3m. Reworked surface sediments act as unsteady, suboxic batch reactors, unconformably overlying relict anoxic, often methanic deposits, and have diagenetic properties largely decoupled from net accumulation of sediment. Despite well-oxygenated water and an abundant reactive organic matter supply, physical disturbance inhibits macrofauna, and benthic communities are dominated by microbial biomass across immense areas. In the surficial suboxic layer, molecular biological analyses, tracer experiments, sediment C/S/Fe compositions, and ??34S, ??18O of pore water SO42- indicate close coupling of anaerobic C, S, and Fe cycles ??18O-SO42- can increase by 2-3??? during anaerobic recycling without net change in ??34S-SO42-, demonstrating SO42- reduction coupled to complete anaerobic reoxidation to SO42- and a ??18O-SO42- reduction+reoxidation fractionation factor???12??? (summed magnitudes). S reoxidation must be coupled to Fe-oxide reduction, contributing to high dissolved Fe2+ (???1mM) and Fe mobilization-export. The reworking of Amazon-Guianas shelf muds alone may isotopically alter ??18O-SO42- equivalent in mass to???25{\%} of the annual riverine delivery of SO42- to the global ocean. Unsteady conditions result in preservation of unusually heavy ??34S isotopic compositions of residual Cr reducible S, ranging from 0??? to {\textgreater}30??? in physically reworked deposits. In contrast, bioturbated facies adjacent to physically reworked regions accumulate isotopically light S (??34S to -20???) in otherwise similar decomposition regimes. The isotopic patterns of both physically and biologically reworked regions can be simulated with simple diagenetic models. Heavy S isotopic signatures are largely a consequence of unsteady diffusion and progressive anaerobic burndown into underlying deposits, whereas isotopically depleted bioturbated deposits predominantly reflect biogenic diffusive scaling and isotopic distillation/diffusive pumping associated with reoxidation in burrow walls immediately adjacent to reduced zones. The S isotopic transition from unsteady physically controlled regions of the Amazon delta moving laterally into bioturbated facies mimics the transition of S isotopic patterns temporally in the geologic record during the rise of bioturbation. No special role for S disproportionation is required to explain these differences. The potential role of unsteady, suboxic diagenesis and dynamic reworking of sediments has been largely ignored in models of the evolution of surficial elemental cycling and interpretations of the geologic record. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition is characterized not only by the biggest Phanerozoic mass extinction, at the end of Permian, but also a prolonged period of recovery of the biota during the succeeding Early Triassic. The delayed recovery is generally attributed to the effects of extreme environmental conditions on the Early Triassic ecosystem. However, there has been very little study of the cause and mechanism of the environmental conditions that prevailed during the period of extinction and subsequent recovery. Research on the Permian-Triassic boundary and Lower Triassic, especially that on environmental events at the beginning of the Triassic in South China, indicates that the slowness of the recovery may be the result of three factors: (1) extreme environmental conditions that persisted through the transitional period and which were maintained by, for example, intermittent contemporary volcanism; (2) a passive evolutionary and ecologic strategy of the biota, in which r-selection taxa were dominant and K-selection forms insignificant; (3) an immature, poorly functioning ecosystem, which had difficulty in responding to and withstanding extreme environmental changes. According to data from South China, environmental changes were frequent during the Late Permian, and especially serious at the Permian-Triassic boundary. The Late Permian ecosystem was well structured and fully functioning as a result of a long period of steady development during the late Palaeozoic, and was capable of resisting general environmental changes. However, increasingly frequent and probably more extreme environmental events in the latest Permian may have led to a general collapse of this ecosystem and to the mass extinction at the end of the Permian. The Early Triassic ecosystem was immature, functioned poorly, and was unable to respond effectively to environmental changes, so that persisting extreme environmental conditions slowed ecosystem reconstruction considerably, and the recovery of the biota therefore took a relatively long time. The environmental events at the Permian-Triassic boundary might not be significantly different from those at other Phanerozoic transitions, but they consisted of a series of events that occurred at intervals during the transitional period. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The cause is still debated, but widespread marine anoxic to euxinic (H2S rich) conditions, from deep to shallow water environments, are commonly suggested. As a proxy for marine oxygen levels, we analyzed delta Mo-98/95 of two LPE sections that represent a gradient in water depth on the northwest margin of Pangea. Results from deep-water slope environments show a large shift in delta Mo-98/95 values from -2.02{\%} to +2.23{\%} at the extinction horizon, consistent with onset of euxinic conditions. In contrast, sub-storm wave base shelf environments show little change in the molybdenum isotopic composition (-1.34{\%} to +0.05{\%}), indicating ongoing oxic conditions across the LPE. These results indicate that areas of the continental shelf of northwest Pangea underwent mass extinction under oxic conditions throughout the LPE event, and that shallow-water anoxia was therefore not a global phenomenon.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria have played a significant role in the formation of past and modern carbonate deposits at the surface of the Earth using a biomineralization process that has been almost systematically considered induced and extracellular. Recently, a deep-branching cyanobacterial species, Candidatus Gloeomargarita lithophora, was reported to form intracellular amorphous Ca-rich carbonates. However, the significance and diversity of the cyanobacteria in which intracellular biomineralization occurs remain unknown. Here, we searched for intracellular Ca-carbonate inclusions in 68 cyanobacterial strains distributed throughout the phylogenetic tree of cyanobacteria. We discovered that diverse unicellular cyanobacterial taxa form intracellular amorphous Ca-carbonates with at least two different distribution patterns, suggesting the existence of at least two distinct mechanisms of biomineralization: (i) one with Ca-carbonate inclusions scattered within the cell cytoplasm such as in Ca. G. lithophora, and (ii) another one observed in strains belonging to the Thermosynechococcus elongatus BP-1 lineage, in which Ca-carbonate inclusions lie at the cell poles. This pattern seems to be linked with the nucleation of the inclusions at the septum of the cells, showing an intricate and original connection between cell division and biomineralization. These findings indicate that intracellular Ca-carbonate biomineralization by cyanobacteria has been overlooked by past studies and open new perspectives on the mechanisms and the evolutionary history of intra- and extracellular Ca-carbonate biomineralization by cyanobacteria.},

abstract = {The middle of the Cretaceous period (about 120 to 80 Myr ago) was a time of unusually warm polar temperatures, repeated reef-drowning in the tropics and a series of oceanic anoxic events (OAEs) that promoted both the widespread deposition of organic-carbon-rich marine sediments and high biological turnover. The cause of the warm temperatures is unproven but widely attributed to high levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. In contrast, there is no consensus on the climatic causes and effects of the OAEs, with both high biological productivity and ocean 'stagnation' being invoked as the cause of ocean anoxia. Here we show, using stable isotope records from multiple species of well-preserved foraminifera, that the thermal structure of surface waters in the western tropical Atlantic Ocean underwent pronounced variability about 100 Myr ago, with maximum sea surface temperatures 3-5 degrees C warmer than today. This variability culminated in a collapse of upper-ocean stratification during OAE-1d (the 'Breistroffer' event), a globally significant period of organic-carbon burial that we show to have fundamental, stratigraphically valuable, geochemical similarities to the main OAEs of the Mesozoic era. Our records are consistent with greenhouse forcing being responsible for the warm temperatures, but are inconsistent both with explanations for OAEs based on ocean stagnation, and with the traditional view (reviewed in ref. 12) that past warm periods were more stable than today's climate.},

abstract = {Widespread anoxic and dysoxic deposition in marine sediments has been associated with a stagnant ocean at the Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary. This P-Tr boundary is also associated with one of the largest mass extinctions of species of the Paleozoic, marking the transition to the Mesozoic. Here we review recent three-dimensional numerical model studies that have investigated possible circulation patterns at the P-Tr boundary. In addition, we conduct new sensitivity experiments with a coupled ocean-atmosphere model of intermediate complexity, including marine chemistry, to study changes of the deep-sea oxygen distribution associated with (1) a significant change in the hydrological cycle and (2) a massive release of methane gas hydrates from marine sediments. Freshening of sea surface water masses by a strong freshwater source along the west coast of south polar Pangea produces a significant local minimum in oxygen in the eastern tropical Panthalassa ocean at intermediate depth and at the sea floor. The methane release experiment with an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 18 times the preindustrial CO2 level simulates a strong increase in sea surface temperature (about 4.5??C) and a vigorous deep-sea circulation. In contrast to the conclusions drawn from previous studies, this reanalysis of the ocean circulation at the P-Tr boundary favors a strong ventilation in most parts of the deep-sea. Thus, a significant change in the oceanic carbon inventories and a reorganization of the marine productivity associated with a stronger biological pump may be required to explain the anoxic sedimentary deposits. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A variety of paleogeographic reconstructions have been published, with applications ranging from paleoclimate, ocean circulation and faunal radiation models to resource exploration; yet their uncertainties remain difficult to assess as they are generally presented as low-resolution static maps. We present a methodology for ground-truthing the digital Palaeogeographic Atlas of Australia by linking the GPlates plate reconstruction tool to the global Paleobiology Database and a Phanerozoic plate motion model. We develop a spatio-temporal data mining workflow to validate the Phanerozoic Palaeogeographic Atlas of Australia with paleoenvironments derived from fossil data. While there is general agreement between fossil data and the paleogeographic model, the methodology highlights key inconsistencies. The Early Devonian paleogeographic model of southeastern Australia insufficiently describes the Emsian inundation that may be refined using biofacies distributions. Additionally, the paleogeographic model and fossil data can be used to strengthen numerical models, such as the dynamic topography and the associated inundation of eastern Australia during the Cretaceous. Although paleobiology data provide constraints only for paleoenvironments with high preservation potential of organisms, our approach enables the use of additional proxy data to generate improved paleogeographic reconstructions.},

abstract = {The end Permian negative [delta]13C excursion is well known but its cause and chronology are still in question. In an attempt to decipher the timing and reasons for this strong decrease, we established high-resolution sedimentological, biostratigraphical and carbonate carbon isotopic studies in four sections in Iran (Abadeh, Shareeza, Zal and Djulfa) and two in Oman (Wadi Sahtan). The position of the sections on two different margins of the Neotethys has allowed us to distinguish between local and global signals. This high-resolution chemostratigraphy, tested for isochrony on the basis of an updated high-resolution conodont and ammonoid biostratigraphy, allows the discrimination of nine successive isotopic events (IE 0-8) for the Permian-Triassic Boundary Interval (PTBI). The negative excursion of the PTBI has been separated into four distinct parts. A first drop (IE 0) occurs in the Late Wuchiapingian with an amplitude of around 1.3[per mille sign]. A second decrease begins (IE 1-2) at the base of the Dzhulfites ammonoid beds (Changhsingian) and continues gradually until the extinction event (top jolfensis conodont interval, without important second-order variations. Its amplitude varies between 1.5[per mille sign] and 2.8[per mille sign] and its duration has been estimated around 2.2 Ma, revealing a non-catastrophic phenomenon. The lower meishanensis-praeparvus conodont Zone records stationary to slightly increasing values (IE 3). The interval of the curve after the extinction event, between the upper meishanensis-praeparvus Zone and the base of the I. isarcica Zone, records numerous second-order variations (IE 4-7). Its amplitude is of 1.2-3.1[per mille sign]. These second-order variations are correlatable in Iran but with some uncertainty with Oman. Poor correlation of these small peaks with others published sections might be due to a higher sensitivity to local perturbations and a lower buffer capacity of the whole ocean. We assume that the processes leading to the extinction event also caused the isotopic decrease before the extinction level with a maximal amplitude of only 2.8[per mille sign]. This allows consideration of some possible mechanisms that were rejected as unrealistic to cause a 4-6[per mille sign] excursion.},

abstract = {Studies of the end-Permian mass extinction have suggested a variety of patterns from a single catastrophic event to multiple phases. But most of these analyses have been based on fossil distributions from single localities. Although single sections may simplify the interpretation of species diversity, they are susceptible to bias from stratigraphic incompleteness and facies control of preservation. Here we use a data set of 1450 species from 18 fossiliferous sections in different paleoenvironmental settings across South China and the northern peri-Gondwanan region, and integrate it with high-precision geochronologic data to evaluate the rapidity of the largest Phanerozoic mass extinction. To reduce the Signor-Lipps effect, we applied constrained optimization (CONOP) to search for an optimal sequence of first and last occurrence datums for all species and generate a composite biodiversity pattern based on multiple sections. This analysis indicates that an abrupt extinction of 62{\%} of species took place within 200 Kyr. The onset of the sudden extinction is around 252.3 Ma, just below Bed 25 at the Meishan section. Taxon turnover and diversification rates suggest a deterioration of the living conditions nearly 1.2 Myr before the sudden extinction. The magnitude of the extinction was such that there was no immediate biotic recovery. Prior suggestions of highly variable, multi-phased extinction patterns reflect the impact of the Signor-Lipps effect and facies-dependent occurrences, and are not supported following appropriate statistical treatment of this larger data set.},

@article{Kump1999,
abstract = {Variations in the carbon isotopic compositions of marine carbonate and organic carbon provide a record of changes in the fraction of organic carbon buried through time and may provide clues to changes in rates of weathering and sources of organic carbon. Paired carbonate and organic carbon isotope determinations provide a possibility of interpreting not only changes in the global carbon cycle through time, but changes in atmospheric pCO(2) as well. Interpretations of these types of data are typically rather qualitative; a quantitative basis is required to develop a better understanding of changes in the carbon cycle. For this purpose, we employ a simple model of the global carbon cycle which is subjected to a number of different perturbations, each lasting 500 ky, i.e., much longer than the residence times of carbon and phosphorus in the ocean-atmosphere system. In addition to standard considerations of carbon mass and isotopic fluxes to the ocean-atmosphere system from weathering and volcanism and fluxes of organic carbon and carbonate-carbon to sediments, the model ;incorporates sensitivity of the photosynthetic carbon isotope effect to changes in pCO(2). The inclusion of this parameter leads to unexpected carbon isotope responses to forcing that causes increased rates of organic carbon burial. A series of simple to more complex simulations illustrates the significant effects of varying differences between the carbon isotopic composition of sedimented carbonate and organic carbon (Delta(B)). With constant Delta(B) a 50{\%} increase in organic carbon burial produces a parallel increase in carbonate and organic carbon isotopic compositions. However, the same simulation with Delta(B) responsive to pCO(2) changes produces an initial parallel delta(13)C increase, but this is followed by an even greater C-13-enrichment in organic carbon because pCO(2) falls in response to increased organic carbon burial. The counterintuitive overall result of the enhanced organic carbon burial event is that the carbonate carbon isotopic composition actually decreases because of the more substantial increase in delta(13)C(org). In addition, we illustrate the effects on carbon isotopic compositions of the oceanic inorganic carbon reservoir and buried organic matter of a 50{\%} increase in volcanic CO2 outgassing, a 50{\%} increase in weathering rate (with coupled phosphate and riverine carbon flux responses), a 50{\%} decrease in shale-associated organic carbon weathering, a 50{\%} decrease in silicate weathering rate, and the possible effects of the rise in abundance of C-4 plants in the late Miocene to Recent. We compare the model simulated carbon isotopic responses for some of these experiments to paired carbonate- and organic-carbon records to illustrate how these records might be interpreted in light of the model response.

abstract = {The biomass, phylogenetic composition, and photoautotrophic metabolism of green sulfur bacteria in the Black Sea was assessed in situ and in laboratory enrichments. In the center of the western basin, bacteriochlorophyll e (BChl e) was detected between depths of 90 and 120 m and reached maxima of 54 and 68 ng liter(-1). High-pressure liquid chromatography analysis revealed a dominance of farnesyl esters and the presence of four unusual geranyl ester homologs of BChl e. Only traces of BChl e (8 ng liter(-1)) were found at the northwestern slope of the Black Sea basin, where the chemocline was positioned at a significantly greater depth of 140 m. Stable carbon isotope fractionation values of farnesol indicated an autotrophic growth mode of the green sulfur bacteria. For the first time, light intensities in the Black Sea chemocline were determined employing an integrating quantum meter, which yielded maximum values between 0.0022 and 0.00075 micromol quanta m(-2) s(-1) at the top of the green sulfur bacterial layer around solar noon in December. These values represent by far the lowest values reported for any habitat of photosynthetic organisms. Only one 16S rRNA gene sequence type was detected in the chemocline using PCR primers specific for green sulfur bacteria. This previously unknown phylotype groups with the marine cluster of the Chlorobiaceae and was successfully enriched in a mineral medium containing sulfide, dithionite, and freshly prepared yeast extract. Under precisely controlled laboratory conditions, the enriched green sulfur bacterium proved to be capable of exploiting light intensities as low as 0.015 micromol quanta m(-2) s(-1) for photosynthetic 14CO2 fixation. Calculated in situ doubling times of the green sulfur bacterium range between 3.1 and 26 years depending on the season, and anoxygenic photosynthesis contributes only 0.002 to 0.01{\%} to total sulfide oxidation in the chemocline. The stable population of green sulfur bacteria in the Black Sea chemocline thus represents the most extremely low-light-adapted and slowest-growing type of phototroph known to date.},

abstract = {Pyrite framboids are densely packed, generally spherical aggregates of submicron-sized pyrite crystals. In this study, a survey was made of framboid size distributions in recently deposited sediments from euxinic (Black Sea; Framvaren Fjord, Norway; Pettaquamscutt River Estuary, Rhode Island, USA), dysoxic (Peru Margin), and oxic (Wallops Island, Virginia, USA; Great Salt Marsh, Delaware, USA) environments. Pyrite framboids in sediments of modern euxinic basins are on average smaller and less variable in size than those of sediments underlying dysoxic or oxic water columns. Down-core trends indicate framboid size distribution is a sediment property fixed very early during anoxic diagenesis, generally within the top few centimeters of burial. Size distributions in modern sediments are comparable with those in ancient sedimentary rocks, evidence that framboid size is preserved through advanced stages of diagenesis and lithification. It is proposed that where secondary pyrite growth is limited, as to preserve primary pyrite textures, framboid size distribution may be used to indicate whether fine-grained sedimentary rocks were deposited under oxic or anoxic conditions. The Crystal Size Distribution Theory relates framboid size to growth time and rate. On the basis of this theory, the characteristic smaller sizes of framboids in sediments of modem euxinic basins reflect shorter average growth times relative to oxic or dysoxic environments. In euxinic environments, framboid nucleation and growth occurs within anoxic water columns, and growth times are, on average, shorter because of hydrodynamic effects than when framboid nucleation and growth occurs within anoxic sediment porewaters underlying oxic water columns. A maximum framboid growth time of 0.4 years is indicated for framboids forming in the water columns of euxinic basins.},

abstract = {It has previously been thought that there was a steep Cretaceous and Cenozoic radiation of marine invertebrates. This pattern can be replicated with a new data set of fossil occurrences representing 3.5 million specimens, but only when older analytical protocols are used. Moreover, analyses that employ sampling standardization and more robust counting methods show a modest rise in diversity with no clear trend after the mid-Cretaceous. Globally, locally, and at both high and low latitudes, diversity was less than twice as high in the Neogene as in the mid-Paleozoic. The ratio of global to local richness has changed little, and a latitudinal diversity gradient was present in the early Paleozoic.},

abstract = {The biological extinction that occurred at the Permian-Triassic boundary represents the most extensive loss of species of any known event of the past 550 million years. There have been a wide variety of explanations offered for this extinction. In the present paper, a number of the more popular recent hypotheses are evaluated in terms of predictions that they make, or that they imply, concerning the global carbon cycle. For this purpose, a mass balance model is used that calculates atmospheric CO2 and oceanic delta13C as a function of time. Hypotheses considered include: (i) the release of massive amounts of CO2 from the ocean to the atmosphere resulting in mass poisoning; (ii) the release of large amounts of CO2 from volcanic degassing; (iii) the release of methane stored in methane hydrates; (iv) the decomposition and oxidation of dead organisms to CO2 after sudden mass mortality; and (v) the long-term reorganization of the global carbon cycle. The modeling indicates that measured short-term changes in delta13C at the boundary are best explained by methane release with mass mortality and volcanic degassing contributing in secondary roles. None of the processes result in excessively high levels of atmospheric CO2 if they occurred on time scales of more than about 1,000 years. The idea of poisoning by high levels of atmospheric CO2 depends on the absence of subthermocline calcium carbonate deposition during the latest Permian. The most far-reaching effect was found to be reorganization of the carbon cycle with major sedimentary burial of organic matter shifting from the land to the sea, resulting in less burial overall, decreased atmospheric O2, and higher atmospheric CO2 for the entire Triassic Period.},

abstract = {Stromatolites and wrinkle structures are often taken to be an important indicator for early life. While both may be shaped by microbial mat growth, this can be open to doubt, so that the contribution of abiotic processes in their construction always needs to be established (Grotzinger {\&} Knoll, 1999). We here report laboratory spray deposition experiments that can generate stromatolites and wrinkle structures in the absence of microbes. These minicolumnar and sometimes branched stromatolites are produced artificially by the aggregation of a synthetic colloid in a turbulent flow regime. They self-organize at the relatively low particle concentrations found in the outer parts of a spray beam. This contrasts with adjacent stratiform deposits that are produced by high rates of colloid deposition and relatively low sediment viscosities found in the centre of a spray beam. These stratiform laminae become subsequently wrinkled during hardening of the colloid. These results support numerical models that together suggest that physicochemical processes are capable of generating laminated sedimentary structures without the direct participation of biology. Geological environments where comparable abiogenic stromatolites and wrinkle structures may be found include: splash-zone silica sinters, desert varnish crusts and early Archean cherts formed from silica gel precursors.},

abstract = {Bulk carbonate and conodonts from three Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary sections at Guryul Ravine (Kashmir), Abadeh (central Iran) and Pufels/Bula/Bulla (Italy) were investigated for $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O. Carbon isotope data highlight environmental changes across the P-T boundary and show the following features: (1) a gradual decrease of ∼4‰ to more than 7‰ starting in the Late Permian (Changhsingian) C. bachmanni Zone, with two superimposed transient positive excursions in the C. meishanensis-H. praeparvus and the M. ultima-S. ? mostleri Zones; (2) two $\delta$13C minima, the first at the P-T boundary and a higher, occasionally double-minimum in the lower I. isarcica Zone. It is unlikely that the short-lived phenomena, such as a breakdown in biological productivity due to catastrophic mass extinction, a sudden release of oceanic methane hydrates or meteorite impact(s), could have been the main control on the latest Permian carbon isotope curve because of its prolonged (0.5 Ma) duration, gradual decrease and the existence of a {\textgreater}1‰ positive shift at the main extinction horizon. The P-T boundary $\delta$13C trend matches in time and magnitude the eruption of the Siberian Traps and other contemporaneous volcanism, suggesting that volcanogenic effects, such as outgassed CO2 from volcanism and, even more, thermal metamorphism of organic-rich sediments, as the likely cause of the negative trend. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Prominent negative delta13C excursions characterize several past intervals of abrupt (2.5per mille sign drop across the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) ca. 55.5 Ma, command our attention because they lack explanation with conventional models for global carbon cycling. Increasingly, Earth scientists have argued that they signify massive release of CH4 from marine gas hydrates, although typically without considering the underlying process or the ensuing ramifications of such an interpretation. At the most basic level, a large, dynamic `gas hydrate capacitor' stores and releases 13C-depleted carbon at rates linked to external conditions such as deep ocean temperature. The capacitor contains three internal reservoirs: dissolved gas, gas hydrate, and free gas. Carbon enters and leaves these reservoirs through microbial decomposition of organic matter, anaerobic oxidation of CH4 in shallow sediment, and seafloor gas venting; carbon cycles between these reservoirs through several processes, including fluid flow, precipitation and dissolution of gas hydrate, and burial. Numerical simulations show that simple gas hydrate capacitors driven by inferred changes in bottom water warming during the PETM can generate a global delta13C excursion that mimics observations. The same modeling extended over longer time demonstrates that variable CH4 fluxes to and from gas hydrates can partly explain other delta13C excursions, rapid and slow, large and small, negative and positive. Although such modeling is rudimentary (because processes and variables in modern and ancient gas hydrate systems remain poorly constrained), acceptance of a vast, externally regulated gas hydrate capacitor forces us to rethink delta13C records and the operation of the global carbon cycle throughout time.},

abstract = {Marine organisms have occupied hard substrates since the Archaean. Shells, rocks, wood and sedimentary hardgrounds offer relatively stable habitats compared to unconsolidated sediments, but the plants and animals which inhabit them must develop means to gain and defend this premium attachment space. Hard substrate communities are formed by organisms with a variety of strategies for adhering to and/or excavating the substrates they inhabit. While mobile grazers, organically attached and even soft-bodied organisms may leave evidence of their former presence in ancient hard substrate communities, a superior fossil record is left by sessile encrusters with mineralised skeletons and by borers which leave trace fossils. Furthermore, encrusters and borers are preserved in situ, retaining their spatial relationships to one another and to the substrate. Spatial competition, ecological succession, oriented growth, and differential utilisation of exposed vs. hidden substrate surfaces can all be observed or inferred. Hard substrate communities are thus excellent systems with which to study community evolution over hundreds of millions of years. Here we review the research on modern and ancient hard substrate communities, and point to some changes that have affected them over geological time scales. Such changes include a general increase in bioerosion of hard substrates, particularly carbonate surfaces, through the Phanerozoic. This is, at least in part, analogous to the infaunalisation trends seen in soft substrate communities. Encrusting forms show an increase in skeletalisation from the Palaeozoic into the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, which may be a response to increasing levels of predation. Hard substrate communities, considering borers and encrusters together, show a rough increase in tiering through the Phanerozoic which again parallels trends seen in soft substrate communities. This extensive review of the literature on living and fossil hard substrate organisms shows that many opportunities remain for large-scale studies of trends through time at the community and clade levels. Palaeontologists will especially benefit by closer integration of their work with that of neontologists, particularly in aspects of ecology such as larval recruitment, competition and succession. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Suspended sediments from 34 major rivers (geographically widespread)and 36 glacial meltwater streams have been examined for their variations in different operationally-defined iron fractions; FeHR (iron oxides soluble in dithionite), FePR (iron soluble in boiling HCl but not in dithionite) and FeU (total iron less that soluble in boiling HCl). River particulates show a close association between FeHR and total iron (FeT), reflecting the effects of chemical weathering which derive oxide iron$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfrom, and retain it in close association with, total iron. Consistent with this, continentalscale$\backslash$r$\backslash$naverage FeHR/FeT ratios vary with runoff ratios (average river runoff per unit$\backslash$r$\backslash$narea/average precipitation per unit area). By contrast, the diminished effects of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nchemical weathering produce no recognizable association of FeHR with FeT in glacial$\backslash$r$\backslash$nparticulates, and instead both FePR and FeU are closely correlated with FeT, reflecting$\backslash$r$\backslash$nessentially pristine mineralogy. A comparison of the globally-averaged compositions of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nriverine particulates and marine sediments reveals that the latter are depleted in FeHR,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nFePR and FeT but enriched in FeU. The river and glacial particulate data are combined$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwith estimates of authigenic, hydrothermal, atmospheric and coastal erosive iron$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfluxes from the literature to produce a global budget for FeHR, FePR, FeU and FeT.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThis budget suggests that the differences between riverine particulates and marine$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsediments can be explained by; (i) preferentially removing FeHR from the riverine$\backslash$r$\backslash$nparticulate flux by deposition into inner shore reservoirs such as floodplains, salt$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmarshes and estuaries; and (ii) mixing the resulting riverine particulates with FeHRdepleted$\backslash$r$\backslash$nglacial particulates. Preliminary measurements of inner shore sediments are$\backslash$r$\backslash$nconsistent with (i) above. Phanerozoic and modern normal marine sediments have$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsimilar iron speciation characteristics, which implies the existence of a long-term$\backslash$r$\backslash$nsteady state for the iron cycle. This steady state could be maintained by a glacioeustatic$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfeedback, where FeHR-enriched riverine particulates are either more effectively trapped$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwhen sealevel is high (small ice masses, diminished glacial erosion), or are mixed with$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngreater masses of FeHR-depleted glacial particulates when sealevel is low (large ice$\backslash$r$\backslash$nmasses, enhanced glacial erosion). Further important controls on the steady state for FeHR operate through the formation of euxinic sediments and ironstones, which also$\backslash$r$\backslash$nprovide sealevel-dependent sinks for FeHR-enriched sediment.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of 20 experiments in which mixes of two or three feldspars were reacted to produce coexisting plagioclase feldspar (PF) and alkali feldspar (AF). Experiments were carried out over the range 700 to 900 °C and 1 to 3 kbar under watersaturated conditions. The compositions of experimental products were determined using the electron microprobe. Starting materials with similar bulk compositions were prepared using different combinations of two and three minerals, and experiments were designed to produce similar AF and PF minerals in the experimental products from different starting binary and ternary compositions. The coexisting AF and PF compositions produced as products define compositional fields that are elongate parallel to the ternary solvus. In 11 experiments reaction was sufficient to produce fields of coexisting AF and PF, or AF, PF, and melt with a bulk composition close to that of the starting mixture. In six experiments significant reaction occurred in the form of reaction rim overgrowths on seeds of the starting materials, but a tie line connecting AF and PF products lies on the Ab-rich side of the starting bulk composition. In these six experiments some of the An-rich plagioclase starting material was removed from reaction by overgrowth of reaction rims. Three experiments produced AF, PF, and melt from a natural granite starting material. The experiments probably approached stable or metastable exchange equilibrium with respect to Na-K-Ca, but an equilibrium degree of AI-Si order in the rims was most likely not achieved. A thermodynamic model following the approach developed by Ghiorso (1984) and Fuhrman and Lindsley (1988) is applied to these new experimental results. A two-feldspar thermometer is presented in which temperature is constrained by equilibria among all three components-Albite, Orthoclase, and Anorthite-in coexisting ternary feldspars.},

abstract = {The carbon isotope ratio ($\delta$13C) of plant material is commonly used to reconstruct the relative distribution of C3 and C4 plants in ancient ecosystems. However, such estimates depend on the $\delta$13C of atmospheric CO2 ($\delta$13CCO2) at the time, which likely varied throughout Earth history. For this study, we use benthic and planktonic $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O records to reconstruct a long-term record of Cenozoic $\delta$13CCO2. Confidence intervals for $\delta$13CCO2 values are assigned after careful consideration of equilibrium and non-equilibrium isotope effects and processes, as well as resolution of the data. We find that benthic foraminifera better constrain $\delta$13CCO2 compared to planktonic foraminiferal records, which are influenced by photosymbiotes, depth of production, seasonal variability, and preservation. Furthermore, sensitivity analyses designed to quantify the effects of temperature uncertainty and diagenesis on benthic foraminifera $\delta$13C and $\delta$18O values indicate that these factors act to offset one another. Our reconstruction suggests that Cenozoic $\delta$13CCO2 averaged −6.1 ± 0.6‰ (1$\sigma$), while only 11.2 million of the last 65.5 million years correspond to the pre-Industrial value of −6.5‰ (with 90{\%} confidence). Here $\delta$13CCO2 also displays significant variations throughout the record, at times departing from the pre-Industrial value by more than 2‰. Thus, the observed variability in $\delta$13CCO2 should be considered in isotopic reconstructions of ancient terrestrial-plant ecosystems, especially during the Late and Middle Miocene, times of presumed C4 grassland expansion. },

abstract = {The best-documented example of rapid climate change that characterized the so-called 'greenhouse world' took place at the time of the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary: introduction of isotopically light carbon into the ocean-atmosphere system, accompanied by global warming of 5-8 degreesC across a range of latitudes, took place over a, few thousand years. Dissociation, release and oxidation of gas hydrates from continental-margin sites and the consequent rapid global warming from the input of greenhouses gases are generally credited with causing the abrupt negative excursions in carbon- and oxygen-isotope ratios. The isotopic anomalies, as recorded in foraminifera, propagated downwards from the shallowest levels of the ocean, implying that considerable quantities of methane survived upward transit through the water column to oxidize in the atmosphere. In the Mesozoic Era, a number of similar events have been recognized, of which those at the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, in the early Toarcian (Jurassic) and in the early Aptian (Cretaceous) currently carry the best documentation for dramatic rises in temperature. In these three examples, and in other less well-documented cases, the lack of a definitive time-scale for the intervals in question hinders calculation of the rate of environmental change. However, comparison with the Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) suggests that these older examples could have been similarly rapid. In both the early Toarcian and early Aptian cases, the negative carbon-isotope excursion precedes global excess carbon burial across a range of marine environments, a phenomenon that defines these intervals as oceanic anoxic events (OAEs). Osmium-isotope ratios (Os-187/Os-188) for both the early Toarcian OAE and the PETM show an excursion to more radiogenic values, demonstrating an increase in weathering and erosion of continental crust consonant with elevated temperatures. The more highly buffered strontium-isotope system (Sr-87/Sr-86) also shows relatively more radiogenic signatures during the early Toarcian OAE, but the early Aptian and Cenomanian-Turonian OAEs show the reverse effect, implying that increased rates of sea-floor spreading and hydrothermal activity dominated over continental weathering in governing sea-water chemistry. The Cretaceous climatic optimum (late Cenomanian to mid Turonian) also shows evidence for abrupt cooling episodes characterized by episodic invasion of boreal faunas into temperate and subtropical regions and changes in terrestrial vegetation, drawdown Of CO2 related to massive marine carbon burial (OAE) may be implicated here. The absence of a pronounced negative carbon-isotope excursion preceding the Cenomanian-Turonian OAE indicates that methane release is not necessarily connected to global deposition of marine organic carbon, but relative thermal maxima are common to all OAEs. 'Cold snaps' have also been identified from the Mesozoic record but their duration, causes and effects are poorly documented.},

abstract = {Nearly 2 km of Upper Permian to Lower Triassic limestones are exposed in the Hambast Mountain, Abadeh region, Iran. Lime mud matrix and most bioclasts of Permian age are recrystallized into large calcite crystals and contain 600-4000 ppm Sr, suggesting a probable aragonite precursor. Low bulk rock ??18O values (-7 to -10??? PDB) and recrystallized textures are also indicative of diagenetic alteration. Within the Murghabian and Abadehian, two gradual upward increases in carbonate and organic matter ??13C compositions (each roughly 3??? PDB in magnitude) are documented. Both are attributed to increased organic productivity and sequestration of organic matter in sediments. Within the Julfian and across the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary, two sharp upward decreases in carbonate and organic matter ??13C values (each 4??? PDB in magnitude) are observed. Both are best explained by mixing of a deep-water mass having low ??13C values and a shallow-water mass having high ??13C compositions. Early Triassic ??13C values, initially low (1??? PDB), increase to 3??? PDB within 100 m above the P-T boundary. Variations in ??13C compositions of carbonate and organic matter and changes in ??13C (=??13Ccar - ??13Corg) indicate that Early Triassic ??13C values were controlled by productivity cycles.

abstract = {The largest extinction of the Phanerozoic occurred near the Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary some 252 Ma ago. Several scenarios and drivers have been proposed for this event. Here we report for the first time an integrated study comprising sedimentological data, biomarker distributions/abundances and selected stable carbon and hydrogen isotopes along with bulk isotopes ([delta]34Spyrite, [delta]13Ccarb, [delta]13Corg) for a Late Permian section from Lusitaniadalen, Spitsbergen, Norway. Sedimentological and geochemical data support a marine transgression and collapse of the marine ecosystem in the Late Permian. Strong evidence for waxing and waning of photic zone euxinia throughout the Late Permian is provided by Chlorobiaceae-derived biomarkers (including [delta]13C data) and [delta]34Spyrite, implying multiple phases of H2S outgassing and potentially several pulses of extinction. A rapid decrease in abundance of various land-plant biomarkers prior to the marine collapse event indicates a dramatic decline of land-plants during the Late Permian and/or increasing distance from palaeoshoreline as a consequence of sea level rise. Changes in [delta]D of selected biomarkers also suggest a change in source of organic matter (OM) or sea level rise. We also found biomarker and isotopic evidence for a phytoplanktonic bloom triggered by eutrophication as a consequence of the marine collapse. Compound specific isotope analyses (CSIA) of algal and land-plant-derived biomarkers, as well as [delta]13C of carbonate and bulk OM provide strong evidence for synchronous changes in [delta]13C of marine and atmospheric CO2, attributed to a 13C-depleted source. The source could be associated with isotopically depleted methane released from the melting of gas clathrates and/or from respired OM, due to collapse of the marine ecosystem.},

abstract = {The Palaeocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM), a rapid global warming event and carbon-cycle perturbation of the early Palaeogene, provides a unique test of climate and carbon-cycle models as well as our understanding of sedimentary methane hydrate stability, albeit under conditions very different from the modern. The principal expression of the PETM in the geological record is a large and rapid negative excursion in the carbon isotopic composition of carbonates and organic matter from both marine and terrestrial environments. Palaeotemperature proxy data from across the PETM indicate a coincident increase in global surface temperatures of approximately 5-6 degrees C. Reliable estimates of atmospheric CO(2) changes and global warming through past transient climate events can provide an important test of the climate sensitivities reproduced by state-of-the-art atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. Here, we synthesize the available carbon-cycle model estimates of the magnitude of the carbon input to the ocean-atmosphere-biosphere system, and the consequent atmospheric pCO(2) perturbation, through the PETM. We also review the theoretical mass balance arguments and available sedimentary evidence for the role of massive methane hydrate dissociation in this event. The plausible range of carbon mass input, approximately 4000-7000 PgC, strongly suggests a major alternative source of carbon in addition to any contribution from methane hydrates. We find that the potential range of PETM atmospheric pCO(2) increase, combined with proxy estimates of the PETM temperature anomaly, does not necessarily imply climate sensitivities beyond the range of state-of-the-art climate models.},

abstract = {A general-purpose ion detector has been developed for fast pulse counting in mass spectrometry. It consists of a six-stage electron multiplier joined to part of a scintillator detector. This novel arrangement combines the virtually noiseless pulse-amplification response of an electron multiplier with the bipolar voltage flexibility of a scintillator detector. The resulting hybrid detector is superior in performance to either an electron multiplier or a conventional scintillator detector. It is designed to detect a beam of positive ions or negative ions focused to a line image or to a spot at the focal plane of a mass analyzer. Background counting noise is less than 1 count/min when the detector is used in either the positive ion or negative ion detecting mode. Mass-resolved ions are post-accelerated through an electric field to give them an additional kinetic energy of 10 keV before they strike the ion-to-electron converter in the electron multiplier. This allows low-energy ions to be detected with an efficiency close to unity, over a range of ion masses from 1 amu up to several hundred amu. Randomly spaced pulses can be counted at rates from 0 Hz to 10 MHz. The design of the detector and its operating characteristics are discussed.},

abstract = {Large perturbations to the global carbon cycle occurred during the Permian–Triassic boundary mass extinction, the largest extinction event of the Phanerozoic Eon (542 Ma to present). Controversy concerning the pattern and mechanism of variations in the marine carbonate carbon isotope record of the Permian– Triassic crisis interval (PTCI) and their relationship to the marine mass extinction has not been resolved to date. Herein, high-resolution carbonate carbon isotope profiles ($\delta$13Ccarb), accompanied by lithofacies, were generated for four sections with microbialite (Taiping, Zuodeng, Cili, and Chongyang) in South China to better constrain patterns and controls on $\delta$13Ccarb variation in the PTCI and to test hypotheses about the temporal relationship between perturbations to the global carbon cycle and the marine mass extinction event. All four study sections exhibit a stepwise negative shift in $\delta$13Ccarb during the Late Permian–Early Triassic, with the shift preceding the end-Permian crisis being larger (N3‰) than that following it (1–2‰). The pre-crisis shifts in $\delta$13Ccarb are widely correlatable and, hence, represent perturbations to the global carbon cycle. The comparatively smaller shifts following the crisis demonstrate that the marine mass extinction event itself had at most limited influence on the global carbon cycle, and that both Late Permian $\delta$13Ccarb shifts and the mass extinction must be attributed to some other cause. Their origin cannot be uniquely determined from C- isotopic data alone but appears to be most compatible with a mechanism based on episodic volcanism in combination with collapse of terrestrial ecosystems and soil erosion.},

abstract = {Mg-calcite-cemented bioturbation traces, glendonite aggregates of idiomorphic, bi-pyramidal crystals and porous, amber-colored carbonate concretions were recovered from a methane-dominated cold vent area in 380 m water depth at the northern Sakhalin Slope, Sea of Okhotsk. Bioturbation traces consist of Mg-calcite cemented sediment with $\delta$13C values between -37 and -46‰ PeeDee Belemnite (PDB), which implicate methane as the carbon source. Glendonite, a calcite pseudomorphosis after ikaite (CaCO3{\textperiodcentered}6H2O), and amber-colored concretions are both composed of varying amounts of calcite and Mg-calcite with $\delta$13C values between -19 and -34‰ PDB. Isotope analyses of an ikaite crystal recovered in the vicinity reveals $\delta$13C values between -20‰ and -22‰ PDB indicating organic matter as the carbon source. Microscopic investigations of glendonites and amber-colored concretions show a porous fabric of a primary calcite phase that is overgrown by a secondary Mg-calcite cement. As ikaite pseudomorphs to porous calcite and as carbon isotope values are the same for the ikaite and the high end member values of glendonite samples, the primary calcite phase is suggested to be a former ikaite phase. Because they share the equal color, fabric, mineral and isotopic composition with glendonites, the amber-colored concretions are also suggested to represent calcite that transformed from ikaite. A mixture of pseudomorph calcite ($\delta$13C -20‰ PDB), which originally formed as ikaite from degraded organic matter, and Mg-calcite ($\delta$13C -43‰ PDB), which crystallized due to the anaerobic oxidation of methane, can explain the varying carbon isotope data of the glendonites and the amber-colored concretions. The growth of ikaite, the transformation of ikaite to calcite, and the crystallization of Mg-calcite indicate changing geochemical conditions within a cold vent environment at different times. Ideal conditions for the ikaite formation are given during the establishment of a cold vent site when upward-migrating, methane-rich fluids enhance the anaerobe decomposition of organic matter, which again increases the phosphate and alkalinity concentrations near the sediment surface. Lower rates of organic matter decomposition during on-going venting decrease these high phosphate but also sulphate concentrations and allows other carbonate phases as Mg-calcite to form. This additional carbonate precipitation and the ikaite formation itself lower the high alkalinity and destabilize ikaite, which pseudomorphs to porous calcite. Triggered by the further upward-shifting SO4/H2S boundary and increasing methane oxidation rates, the typical cold vent methane-derived carbonate genesis takes place, which cements the sediment pore space and induces the secondary Mg-calcite crystallization within the glendonite fabric. Taking this scenario into account, ikaite formation should be a common process in the beginning of methane-dominated vent activity at cold bottom water temperatures; glendonite pseudomorphs can be assumed to represent a typical manifestation at fossil and recent cold vents at high latitudes. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Permian ended with the largest of known mass extinctions in the history of life. This signal event has been difficult to recognize in Antarctic non-marine rocks, because the boundary with the Triassic is defined by marine fossils at a stratotype section in China. Late Permian leaves (Glossopteris) and roots Vertebraria), and Early Triassic leaves (Dicroidium) and vertebrates (Lystrosaurus) roughly constrain the Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic boundary in Antarctica. Here we locate the boundary in Antarctica more precisely using carbon isotope chemostratigraphy and total organic carbon analyses in six measured sections from Allan Hills, Shapeless Mountain, Mount Crean, Portal Mountain, Coalsack Bluff and Graphite Peak. Palaeosols and root traces also are useful for recognizing the Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic boundary because there was a complete turnover in terrestrial ecosystems and their soils. A distinctive kind of palaeosol with berthierine nodules, the Dolores pedotype, is restricted to Early Triassic rocks. Late Permian and Middle Triassic root traces are carbonaceous, whereas those of the Early Triassic are replaced by claystone or silica. Antarctic Permian{\&}ndash;Triassic sequences are among the most complete known, judging from the fine structure and correlation of carbon isotope anomalies.},

abstract = {Molybdenum (Mo) is a popular paleoproxy for tracking the spatiotemporal pattern of euxinic (anoxic and sulfidic) conditions in the ancient ocean, yet surprisingly little is known about the processes leading to its fixation under sulfidic conditions. Pyrite has been proposed to be the main host phase for Mo sequestration. To clarify the role played by pyrite, and thus to refine the utility of this paleoproxy, modern and ancient samples from six different study sites were analyzed, all representing euxinic conditions, using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Although pyrite often shows substantial enrichments relative to average crust and even matrix samples of similar size, our results show that most of the Mo in euxinic muds and shales is found in the non-pyrite matrix (80-100{\%}) and not in the pyrite grains (0-20{\%})-simply because the volume of matrix dominates the bulk sediments/rocks. A relationship between the percent of Mo hosted by pyrite and the sulfur isotope composition of that pyrite is observed and can be linked to post-depositional alteration. Specifically, the oldest, typically most altered samples, show the highest ??34S values because of limited sulfate availability at the time of their formation in the early ocean. In these old samples, the relatively small amount of Mo sequestered initially within pyrite is more likely to have been released to the matrix during the strong recrystallization overprints that these rocks have disproportionately suffered. Despite the universal importance of appreciable H2S availability during Mo uptake, we conclude that pyrite should be viewed as a nontrivial sink for Mo but clearly not the primary host in most euxinic shales and rather suggest that other burial pathways should be emphasized in future studies of the mechanisms of Mo sequestration in such settings. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Gujo-Hachiman section in central Japan provides a rare window into environmental conditions within the Panthalassic Ocean, which encompassed more than half the Earth's surface at 251 Ma. The section is characterized by a sharp transition from green-gray organic-poor cherts to black siliceous shales in the uppermost Permian. Normalization to the clay fraction demonstrates that apparent increases in the concentrations of organic matter and trace metals above this transition were due primarily to the loss of a diluent biogenic (radiolarian) silica flux and only secondarily to a small shift toward more reducing bottom waters. In the black shale, pyrite abundance increases by a factor of ca 30x and is dominated by framboidal grains of probable syngenetic origin. These observations suggest that the expansion of low-oxygen conditions within the Panthalassic Ocean was focused within the oxygen-minimum zone rather than at the seafloor. Such a pattern implies that (1) changes in nutrient fluxes and primary productivity rates, rather than stagnation of oceanic circulation, were a key factor influencing oceanic redox conditions around the Permian-Triassic boundary, and (2) large regions of the Panthalassic Ocean underwent only limited redox changes, providing potential refugia for marine taxa that survived into the Triassic.},

abstract = {Middle to Upper Permian shallow marine carbonates in the Kamura area, Kyushu (SW Japan), were derived from a paleo-atoll complex developed on an ancient seamount in mid-Panthalassa. The Capitanian (Upper Guadalupian) Iwato Formation (19 m-thick dark gray limestone) and the conformably overlying Wuchiapingian (Lower Lopingian) Mitai Formation (17 m-thick light gray dolomitic limestone) are composed of bioclastic limestone of subtidal facies, yielding abundant fusulines. A secular change in stable carbon isotope ratio of carbonate carbon ([delta]13Ccarb) was analyzed in the Kamura section in order to document the oceanographic change in the superocean Panthalassa with respect to the mass extinction across the Guadalupian-Lopingian boundary (G-LB). The Iwato Formation is characterized mostly by unusually high positive [delta]13Ccarb values of + 4.9 to + 6.2[per mille sign], whereas the Mitai Formation by low positive values from + 1.9 to + 3.5[per mille sign]. The negative excursion occurred in three steps around the G-LB and the total amount of the negative shifts reached over 4[per mille sign]. A remarkably sharp drop in [delta]13Ccarb values, for 2.4[per mille sign] from 5.3 down to 2.9[per mille sign], occurs in a 2 m-thick interval of the topmost Iwato Formation, after all large-shelled fusulines and bivalves disappeared abruptly. Such a prominent high positive [delta]13Ccarb plateau interval in the end-Guadalupian followed by a large negative shift across the G-LB was detected for the first time, and this trend in the mid-superoceanic sequence is correlated chemostratigraphically in part with the GSSP (Global Stratotype Section and Point) candidate for the G-LB in S. China. The present results prove that the end-Guadalupian event was doubtlessly global in context, affecting circum-Pangean basins, Tethys, and Panthalassa. The end-Guadalupian interval of a high positive plateau in [delta]13Ccarb values over + 5[per mille sign] is particularly noteworthy because it recorded an unusually high bio-productivity period that has not been known in the Permian. This end-Guadalupian high-productivity event, newly named "Kamura event", suggests burial of a huge amount of organic carbon, draw-down of atmospheric CO2 and resultant global cooling at the end of Guadalupian, considerably after the Gondwana glaciation. The low temperatures during the Kamura event may have caused the end-Guadalupian extinction of large-shelled Tethyan fusulines and bivalves adapted to warm climate. On the other hand, the following event of ca. 4[per mille sign] negative shift in [delta]13Ccarb values across the G-LB indicates a global warming in the early Lopingian. This may have allowed radiation of the new Wuchiapingian fauna, and this trend appears to have continued into the Mesozoic. These observations are in good agreement with the global sea-level curve in the Middle-Late Permian. The smooth and gradual pattern of the negative shift suggests that the causal mechanism was not of catastrophic nature (e.g. bolide impact, sudden melting of methane hydrate) but was long and continuous.},

abstract = {Rhaetian fossil vertebrate faunas of Britain represent rich but biased samples of taxonomic diversity during uppermost Triassic time. Review of the Westbury Formation, Penarth Group, in particular, reveals a combination of marine, littoral, and terrestrial elements. Minimally, six species of shark are preserved along with a myriacanthid holocephalan, at least four actinopterygian taxa, a characteristic lungfish, ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, and potentially the earliest representative of the Choristodera. Rare mammalian occurrences in the Westbury beds are also possible. Severnichthys gen. nov. is a large osteichthyan, probably a palaeonisciform chondrostean, which historically has been mistaken for a labyrinthodont amphibian. At least two additional actinopterygian species and a holocephalan are known from die Lilstock Formation, and a mammal or mammallike reptile is recorded from the uppermost Blue Anchor Formation. Analysis of element abundance in the disarticulated Westbury Formation assemblage indicates that many parts of some taxa are never preserved while other elements of the same form are common. Such preservational bias suggests that many species may be missing entirely from this long‐studied but poorly understood taphocoenosis. Possibly contemporaneous cave faunas from nearby upland areas give a similarly biased picture of the terrestrial fauna during this time of widespread marine transgression.

abstract = {Bioturbation in aquatic sediments results from many different biological activities, inducing particle displacement over a variety of length and time scales. Despite this inherent complexity, empirical tracer studies show that bioturbational mixing is often well described by a simple diffusive model. To resolve this apparent contradiction between biological complexity and modeling simplicity, we present an investigation into the diffusive nature of bioturbation. To this end, we examine a stochastic description of bioturbation, where particle mixing is described as a sequence of random bioturbation events. Particle movement is governed by three basic variables: the direction of jumping, the jumping distance, and the waiting time between two bioturbation events. A set of gradually more complex random-walk models is constructed by treating these variables consecutively as stochastic. Each time, the conditions are determined under which these random walks generate diffusive behavior. One important criterion is that the tracer should experience a sufficient number of bioturbation events, and so the time scale of observation should be large enough. The full list of conditions needed to arrive at diffusive mixing is different and more extensive than in past examinations of the topic. This analysis clarifies the relation between the biodiffusion model and more sophisticated mixing models, revealing that the conventional distinction between local and nonlocal models is not entirely relevant. Instead, we propose a distinction between "normal" or "anomalous" mixing, which is based on the intrinsic nature of the faunal activities causing particle dispersal. Overall, our analysis provides insight into the conditions under which the biodiffusion model can be applied to tracer profiles, and also shows why it sometimes fails, as is the case of sediments dominated by head-down deposit feeders.},

To establish a more extensive, global calibration of the TEX86 paleothermometer, we analyzed GDGTs in 287 (in comparison with 44 in currently used calibration) core-top sediments distributed over the world oceans and deposited at different depths. Comparisons of TEX86 data with (depth-weighted) annual mean temperatures of the overlying waters between 0 m and 4000 m as well as with different seasonal mean temperatures at 0m water depth showed that the TEX86 proxy reflects mostly annual mean temperatures of the upper mixed layer. The relationship between TEX86 values and sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) was non-linear mainly because below 5 C the change in TEX86 values was minor with temperature. This suggests that the TEX86 proxy might not be directly applicable for the Polar Oceans. Nevertheless, between 5 C and 30 C, the TEX86 proxy has a strong linear relationship with SSTs. Here, we, therefore, propose a new linear calibration model (T = 10.78 + 56.2 * TEX86, r2 = 0.935, n = 223) for past SST reconstructions using the TEX86 palaeothermometer.},

abstract = {In order to make meaningful interpretations of trace element and isotopic information from geomaterials, prior characterization of the material of interest with respect to structural and chemical homogeneity, radiation damage, and microstructure is often required. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful analytical tool that may be used to fully characterise a wide range of synthetic and natural materials. The focused ion beam technique (FIB) is an ideal tool for TEM sample preparation that allows for the fabrication of electron-transparent foils with typical dimensions of 15 × 10 × 0.150 $\mu$m from any region of interest (i.e., site-specific) and in virtually any material. FIB sample preparation consumes only a small volume of material (approximately 2300 $\mu$m3 for a standard foil with the dimensions 15 × 10 × 0.150 $\mu$m), leaving most of the material essentially unaffected by the sampling process. Modern TEM facilitates the measurement of chemical composition with unsurpassed spatial resolution (e.g., nanometer scale). High-resolution imaging and electron diffraction provide important complimentary structural information. It is the combination of crystal structure information and chemical composition that allows for the complete characterization of the volume of interest. High-resolution elemental mapping, or line scans, may be used to acquire complete energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) spectra of a material pixel by pixel. Subsequent evaluation of the data allows for the correlation of the EDX spectrum with the respective elemental map or line scan with an image, thus illustrating spatially resolved chemical composition variations at the 0.5-1.0 wt.{\%} level. Frequently, minerals enclose sub micrometer- or even nanometre-sized inclusions of minerals, fluids, or silicate melt, which are of great interest to geoscientists. Nanoinclusions (e.g., in diamond or olivine) are of particular interest because they may have preserved their original crystal structure thus providing a geobarometer recording the pressure conditions at the time of formation of the inclusion. FIB/TEM are appropriate techniques to sample and subsequently define the chemical composition and the structural state of mineral inclusion on the nanometre scale. The combination of FIB with an SEM allows for 3D information to be obtained from samples including: 3D imaging (e.g., phase distribution and volume of the individual phases in symplectites); 3D distribution of elements in a specific volume (3D elemental maps); and three dimensional texture analysis using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed Ir, Ru, Rh, Pt and Pd in a set of samples from the global stratotype section and point (GSSP) of the Permian–Triassic boundary at Meishan, China, using isotope dilution inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ID-ICP-MS) and nickel sulfide fire assay (NiS-FA) combined with Te coprecipitation. The samples have no Ir anomaly (5–53 pg/g), and their PGE patterns normalized to chondrites are highly fractionated with Ir/Pd ratios of 0.02–0.03 × CI, distinct from most extraterrestrial materials. In contrast, these patterns are closely parallel to those of the Siberian and probably Emeishan flood basalts, suggestive of possible sources of PGEs from the basalts. The abundances of PGEs increase in order of the pyrite lamina on the top of bed 24, bed 25 and bed 26, and then decrease to bed 28, probably indicative of a maximum eruption of the flood basalts during deposition of bed 26. The new data favor massive volcanism, rather than extraterrestrial impact, as a major cause of the Permian–Triassic boundary mass extinction.},

abstract = {The precise interpretation of environmental sulfur isotope records requires a quantitative understanding of the biochemical controls on sulfur isotope fractionation by the principle isotope-fractionating process within the S cycle, microbial sulfate reduction (MSR). Here we provide the only direct observation of the major ((34)S/(32)S) and minor ((33)S/(32)S, (36)S/(32)S) sulfur isotope fractionations imparted by a central enzyme in the energy metabolism of sulfate reducers, dissimilatory sulfite reductase (DsrAB). Results from in vitro sulfite reduction experiments allow us to calculate the in vitro DsrAB isotope effect in (34)S/(32)S (hereafter, [Formula: see text]) to be 15.3 ± 2‰, 2$\sigma$. The accompanying minor isotope effect in (33)S, described as [Formula: see text], is calculated to be 0.5150 ± 0.0012, 2$\sigma$. These observations facilitate a rigorous evaluation of the isotopic fractionation associated with the dissimilatory MSR pathway, as well as of the environmental variables that govern the overall magnitude of fractionation by natural communities of sulfate reducers. The isotope effect induced by DsrAB upon sulfite reduction is a factor of 0.3-0.6 times prior indirect estimates, which have ranged from 25 to 53‰ in (34)$\epsilon$DsrAB. The minor isotope fractionation observed from DsrAB is consistent with a kinetic or equilibrium effect. Our in vitro constraints on the magnitude of [Formula: see text] is similar to the median value of experimental observations compiled from all known published work, where (34)$\epsilon$ r-p = 16.1‰ (r-p indicates reactant vs. product, n = 648). This value closely matches those of MSR operating at high sulfate reduction rates in both laboratory chemostat experiments ([Formula: see text] 17.3 ± 1.5‰, 2$\sigma$) and in modern marine sediments ([Formula: see text] 17.3 ± 3.8‰). Targeting the direct isotopic consequences of a specific enzymatic processes is a fundamental step toward a biochemical foundation for reinterpreting the biogeochemical and geobiological sulfur isotope records in modern and ancient environments.},

Understanding its cause and the controls on extinction/recovery dynamics depends on an accurate and precise age model. U-Pb zircon dates for five volcanic ash beds from the Global Stratotype Section and Point for the Permian-Triassic boundary at Meishan, China, define an age model for the extinction and allow exploration of the links between global environmental perturbation, carbon cycle disruption, mass extinction, and recovery at millennial timescales. The extinction occurred between 251.941 ± 0.037 and 251.880 ± 0.031 Mya, an interval of 60 ± 48 ka. Onset of a major reorganization of the carbon cycle immediately precedes the initiation of extinction and is punctuated by a sharp (3‰), short-lived negative spike in the isotopic composition of carbonate carbon. Carbon cycle volatility persists for ∼500 ka before a return to near preextinction values. Decamillenial to millennial level resolution of the mass extinction and its aftermath will permit a refined evaluation of the relative roles of rate-dependent processes contributing to the extinction, allowing insight into postextinction ecosystem expansion, and establish an accurate time point for evaluating the plausibility of trigger and kill mechanisms. },

abstract = {The earliest ammonite species of Jurassic type, Psiloceras spelae GUEX, was unknown till 1998. This species bridges the long gap between die latest Triassic and the earliest Jurassic ammonoids. It was discovered in North America, then in South America and finally in Europe. The species is proposed as boundary marker for the base of the Jurassic system. It is known in two forms which are regarded as subspecies. The European subspecies is here introduced as P. spelae tirolicum n. ssp. This taxon occurs in the Northern Calcareous Alps of Tyrol as the oldest European Jurassic type ammonite. Both subspecies characterize the first Jurassic ammonite biohorizon and are closely related. Their slight differences may be due to biogeographic separation. The preservation admits a complete diagnosis of the new subspecies. Besides psiloceratid characters still phylloceratid characters are present indicating the origin of the psiloceratids. Additionally, slightly younger psiloceratids are described which were known only from South and North America thus far. They are older than the oldest psiloceratids hitherto known from Europe. AU these forms are elements of the first biochronological ammonite unit of the Jurassic, the Tilmanni Chronozone which is situated below the Planorbis Chronozone. It is assumed that during the endTriassic biotic crisis only those ammonites survived which lived in the open parts of the oceans. A re-population of neritic shelf areas took place from the oceanic realms in line with the gradual Hettangian transgression. This may explain the global similarity of the first Jurassic ammonites and their later biogeographic diversification. A time calculation based on the sedimentation rate of the P. spelae tirolicum n. ssp. bearing sections leads to the conclusion that the earlier Triassic-Jurassic ammonite gap of about 250 to 300 ka now can be reduced to approximately 100 ka. {\textcopyright}2009 E.

abstract = {Models of mass extinctions caused by greenhouse warming depend on the ability of warming to affect the oxygenation of the ocean, either through slowing circulation or changes in biological productivity and the organic carbon budget. Opal Creek, Alberta, Canada is a biostratigraphically continuous Permian-Triassic Boundary (PTB) section deposited in deep water on an outer shelf setting in the vast and understudied Panthalassic Ocean, along the western margin of Pangaea. The latest-Permian extinction is here represented as the disappearance of the previously dominant benthic fauna (siliceous sponges). On the basis of nitrogen and reduced sulfur isotopes as well as productivity-sensitive trace elements, the Middle Permian at Opal Creek is interpreted as a highly productive coastal upwelling zone where vigorous denitrification and sulfate reduction occurred in a mid-water oxygen minimum. Similar conditions appear to have continued into the latest Permian until the onset of a euxinic episode represented by a discrete pyrite bed and several trace element indicators of high productivity. This euxinic pulse is followed by the extinction of benthic fauna and a shift in nitrogen and sulfur isotopes to more normal marine values, suggesting the cessation of coastal upwelling and the consequent weakening of the mid-water oxygen minimum. The Lower Triassic appears to be a dysoxic, relatively unproductive environment with a bottom water oxygen minimum. Rhenium-osmium isotope systematics show a minimum of radiogenic Os near the main extinction event, which may be due to volcanic input, and increasingly radiogenic values approaching the PTB, possibly due to increased continental erosion. The Opal Creek system demonstrates that, while the biogeochemical crisis in the latest Permian was capable of impacting the coastal upwelling modality of ocean circulation, a transient increase in productivity likely drove the system toward euxinia and, ultimately, extinction. 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of the catastrophic end-Permian mass extinction, the Early Triassic records recurrent perturbations in the carbon isotope signal, most notably during the Smithian and through the Smithian/Spathian Boundary (SSB; {\~{}} 1.5 myr after the Permian/Triassic boundary), which show some of the largest excursions of the Phanerozoic. The late Smithian also corresponds to major biotic turnovers and environmental changes, such as temperature fluctuations, that deeply impacted the recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction. Here we document the paired carbon isotope signal along with an analysis of the trace and major elements at the long-known Hot Springs section (southeastern Idaho, USA). This section records Early Triassic sediments from the Griesbachian-Dienerian up to the lower Spathian. We show that the organic and carbonate $\delta$13C variations mirror the signals identified at a global scale. Particularly, the middle Smithian-SSB event represented by a negative-positive isotopic couplet is well identified and is not of diagenetic origin. We also document a positive excursion potentially corresponding to the Dienerian/Smithian Boundary. Observed Smithian-Spathian excursions are recorded similarly in both the organic and carbonate reservoirs, but the organic matter signal systematically shows unexpectedly dampened variations compared to its carbonate counterpart. Additionally, we show that variations in the net isotopic effect (i.e., $\Delta$13C) probably resulted from a complex set of forcing parameters including either a mixing between terrestrial and marine organic matter depending on the evolution of the depositional setting, or variations in the biological fractionation. We establish that the $\Delta$13C signal cannot be directly related to CO2-driven temperature variations at Hot Springs. Even though the carbon isotope signal mirrors the Early Triassic variations known at the global scale, the Hot Springs signal probably also reflects local influences on the carbon isotopes that are neither diagenetic nor representative of the global exogenic carbon cycle.},

abstract = {The concept of oxygen- and capacity-dependent thermal tolerance in aquatic ectotherms has successfully explained climate-induced effects of rising temperatures on species abundance in the field. Oxygen supply to tissues and the resulting aerobic performance characters thus form a primary link between organismal fitness and its role and functioning at the ecosystem level. The thermal window of performance in water breathers matches their window of aerobic scope. Loss of performance reflects the earliest level of thermal stress, caused by hypoxaemia and the progressive mismatch of oxygen supply and demand at the borders of the thermal envelope. Oxygen deficiency elicits the transition to passive tolerance and associated systemic and cellular stress signals like hormonal responses or oxidative stress as well as the use of protection mechanisms like heat shock proteins at thermal extremes. Thermal acclimatization between seasons or adaptation to a climate regime involves shifting thermal windows and adjusting window widths. The need to specialize on a limited temperature range results from temperature-dependent trade-offs at several hierarchical levels, from molecular structure to whole-organism functioning, and may also support maximized energy efficiency. Various environmental factors like CO(2) (ocean acidification) and hypoxia interact with these principal relationships. Existing knowledge suggests that these factors elicit metabolic depression supporting passive tolerance to thermal extremes. However, they also exacerbate hypoxaemia, causing a narrowing of thermal performance windows and prematurely leading the organism to the limits of its thermal acclimation capacity. The conceptual analysis suggests that the relationships between energy turnover, the capacities of activity and other functions and the width of thermal windows may lead to an integrative understanding of specialization on climate and, as a thermal matrix, of sensitivity to climate change and the factors involved. Such functional relationships might also relate to climate-induced changes in species interactions and, thus, community responses at the ecosystem level.},

abstract = {The bulk phosphorus (P) distribution in sediment samples from the oxygen minimum zone of the northern Arabian Sea was determined using two methods: sequential chemical extraction (the 'SEDEX' procedure) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy of the phosphorus K-edge. Our results show good agreement between iron (Fe-)associated P and calcium phosphate minerals (Ca-P) determined by both methods. Furthermore, we find that SEDEX exchangeable P likely represents loosely Fe-bound P, and that the SEDEX detrital fraction may consist partly of polyphosphate, i.e. microbially synthesized intracellular phosphate. Below productive waters with relatively high sedimentary organic matter and P contents, polyphosphates may represent an important P sink that is not easily identified by chemical sequential extraction. This study highlights the value of SEDEX as a generally accurate and fast P speciation technique (especially for Fe- and Ca-P) and, for the first time, demonstrates the possibilities of P K-edge XANES as a bulk P speciation tool for marine sediments.},

abstract = {Stromatolites date back some 3.5 billion years and constitute the most common and conspicuous fossils through the Proterozoic. These organosedimentary structures decreased dramatically in diversity and abundance by the late Neoproterozoic, a phenomenon often ascribed to destructive grazing by newly evolved metazoans. We investigated the concurrent processes of microbial calcification and metazoan bioerosion in one of the few locations (Rio Mesquites, Cuatro Ci{\'{e}}negas, Coahuila, Mexico) where living freshwater stromatolites, formed by cyanobacteria and diatoms, coexist with significant populations of metazoan grazers. We used microsensor chemical profiling and monitoring of bulk water Ca2+ concentrations to determine calcification rates and their dependence on microbial metabolism. The bioerosive impact resulting from grazing by endemic hydrobiid gastropods was assessed by gravimetric quantification of carbonaceous faecal pellet production. Calcification was clearly light-dependent, reaching maximal rates (saturation) at low incident light intensity, and was surprisingly efficient, with O2/Ca2+ exchange ratios well above unity, and with absolute rates similar to those found in corals. However, the erosive action of grazing snails removed most of these carbonate inputs from the oncolites. Thus, a precarious balance between constructive and destructive geobiological processes was at play in the system. The fact that accretion barely exceeded bioerosion in an environment highly conducive to calcification supports the potential impact of faunal grazing as causal agent in the demise of stromatolites in the late Proterozoic. Our findings indicate that a search for fossil evidence of bioerosive grazing in the form of carbonaceous faecal pellets associated with fossil stromatolites may provide a means to test that hypothesis directly.},

abstract = {The oxidation of sulfide, generated by bacterial sulfate reduction, is a key process in the biogeochemistry of marine sediments, yet the pathways and oxidants are poorly known. By the use of (35)S-tracer studies of the S cycle in marine and freshwater sediments, a novel shunt function of thiosulfate (S(2)O(3)(2-)) was identified. The S(2)O(3)(2-) constituted 68 to 78 percent of the immediate HS(-)-oxidation products and was concurrently (i) reduced back to HS(-), (ii) oxidized to SO(4)(2-), and (iii) disproportionated to HS(-) + SO(4)(2-). The small thiosulfate pool is thus involved in a dynamic HS(-) - S(2)O(3)(2-) cycle in anoxic sediments. The disproportionation of thiosulfate may help account for the large difference in isotopic composition ((34)S/(32)S) of sulfate and sulfides in sediments and sedimentary rocks.},

abstract = {Abstract. Fractionations of carbon and oxygen isotopes and magnesium between coexisting dolomite and calcite have been determined for marbles and calcareous schists of a wide variety of metamorphic environments from Vermont and the Grenville Province of Ontario. Concordant equilibrium fractionations are given by 83 {\%} of the samples. Calibration of the isotopic thermometers using the Mg-calcite solvus thermometer gave in the temperature range: 650{\~{}}176 100{\~{}} 1,000 In eDOl-Se t = 0.45 (10{\~{}} -2) -- 0.40 1,000 1n {\~{}}DC1-{\~{}}C t = 0.18 (106T- 2) -{\{}- 0.17. These isotopic fractionation expressions differ significantly from the experimentally derived relations, including the dolomite-Mg-calcite C TM partial exchange experiments of this study. Temperature ranges obtained for the metamorphic zones of Vermont are: chlorite zone, 210 {\~{}} to 295 {\~{}} C; biotite zone, 255 {\~{}} to 400 {\~{}} C; staurolite-kyanite zone, 110 {\~{}} to 550 {\~{}} C. In amphibolite- faeies rocks the quenched partition relations can be complex. The temperature of quench or recrystallization may be as large as 400 {\~{}} C below the inferred metamorphic maximum. Oxygen isotope disequilibrium in high grade rocks, particularly from the Chester dome area, Vermont, is characterized by large negative 80 Dis -- dOcist values. The size of the equilibrium exchange system for carbon and oxygen isotopes and magnesium is small, less than a few inches across the inferred relict bedding. This is attributed to the lack of a mobile pore fluid except in systems undergoing decarbonation. C13/C12 ratios in Grenville and Vermont marbles and 01s/01{\~{}} ratios in Grenville and greenschist-facies Vermont carbonates span the range of ancient limestones. Staurolite-kyanite zone calcareous schists and marbles from the Chester dome area, Vermont are depleted in Ols({\~{}}ols:12 to 200/0o) due to equilibrium or disequilibrium decarbonation and some partial exchange. Extrapolation of the dolomite-calcite fractionation expressions to 20{\~{}} indicates that dolomite is enriched in 0 TM by about 4.90/oo and in C 13 by about 2.43/06 .}},

abstract = {The Baltoscandian epeiric sea was characterised by relatively slow but continuous carbonate deposition from the Middle Ordovician up to the Silurian. Relatively good preservation of Ordovician and Silurian carbonate rocks in Baltoscandia makes this region unique for chemostratigraphical and palaeoenvironmental studies. Previous Palaeozoic carbon isotope studies have revealed isotopic events in different lithologies over the Baltoscandian palaeobasin and some of them on different palaeocontinents. We propose a composite carbon isotope curve for the Baltoscandian region, a new subdivision of the Middle and Upper Ordovician succession into seventeen chemostratigraphic zones, and an improved nomenclature of isotopic excursions, based on analyses of $\delta$13Ccarb data from 25 drillcore and outcrop sections of Estonia, Latvia and Sweden. The composite carbon isotope curve is compared with biostratigraphical data on conodont and chitinozoan distribution. The Katian-Hirnantian interval with highly fluctuating isotopic values shows climatic cyclicity of about two million years in Baltoscandia. No abrupt changes occur in the Dapingian-Sandbian part of the Baltoscandian isotope curve, but the mid-Darriwilian Excursion nearly coincides with the onset of cooler temperatures similar to modern-like equatorial sea surface temperatures and related global biodiversification increase, suggesting a climatic background for this event. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Late Devonian mass extinction was unusually protracted and ecologically selective, with preferential diversity losses among reef-building organisms and tropical, shallow-water faunas in general. We have investigated the link between the extinction's unique characteristics and changes in biogeochemical cycling through analyses of the delta13C and C:N:P atomic ratios of organic matter buried across the Kellwasser Horizons in western New York State. Each horizon is characterized by (1) a long-term, +4per thousand-5per thousand excursion in delta13C, {\~{}}3per thousand of which occurs within the horizon, and (2) a dramatic increase in the burial ratios of C:N:P, from values of {\~{}}100:15:1 to an average of {\~{}}5000:170:1. On the basis of these results, we propose that (1) increased efficiency of biolimiting nutrient recycling, resulting from cyclic water column stratification and mixing, promoted eutrophication during Kellwasser deposition in New York, and (2) the isotope excursions represent the composite effect of long-term, global organic C burial, and local changes in photosynthetic C isotope fractionation related to nutrient availability. This eutrophication model forges a mechanistic link between proposed Late Devonian climatic cooling and the selective demise of taxa likely to have been narrowly adapted to oligotrophic conditions.},

abstract = {Two hundred sixty-four delta(18)O and delta(13)C values of Permian articulate brachiopod shells were analyzed and 81 of these values were characterized as well preserved and biostratigraphically well defined. These were then utilized for construction of baseline oxygen and carbon isotope curves for the Permian interval. In addition, 21 delta(13)C whole rock values are reported for the Wordian and Capitanian. The early Permian, Asselian to Artinskian, times are characterized by similar to 2.5 parts per thousand decrease in oxygen isotope values, from similar to-0.7 parts per thousand to -3.3 parts per thousand (V-PDB). This is attributed to a similar to 4-7 degrees C increase in temperature in the Southern Urals, concomitant with the retreat of the Permo-Carboniferous ice sheets and return of the O-18-depleted melt water into the oceans. The Late Permian samples from Iran (Jolfa at Kuh-e-Ali-Bashi) and China (Meishan) yield delta(18)O values, and presumably temperatures, similar to those that followed the termination of the large-scale glaciation in the Lower Permian. In between, the upper Kungurian to Capitanian samples from the Delaware Basin (Guadalupe Mountains) are enriched in O-18, at -1.5 parts per thousand to -3 parts per thousand. We have no definitive explanation for these data, but tentatively suggest that the "anomaly" can potentially be a result of evaporative enrichment of seawater in O-18, due to intracratonic, and setting of the basin. The O-18-enriched nature of the Zechstein samples (-1.2 parts per thousand to +2.5 parts per thousand), on the other hand, is in all probability a reflection of the high evaporation rates in the Zechstein sea. The Permian interval is characterized by a relatively constant delta(13)C, at about 4 parts per thousand. The exceptions are again the brachiopods from the Delaware Basin (Guadalupe Mountains), which show similar to 1.6 parts per thousand increase in the Guadalupian, to values of up to 5.9 parts per thousand in the Wordian. A tentative explanation, as in the case of oxygen, is based on the proposition that the semi-enclosed Delaware Basin was likely stratified, with sequestration of the C-13-depleted carbon to the deeper water layers and a complementary C-13 enrichment in the upper oxygenated layer. The coeval open ocean water DIC may have been similar to that of the remainder of the Permian interval, at similar to 4 parts per thousand, as indicated by whole rock carbonate samples from Oman, Sicily, and Iran. In the latest Permian, the trend mimics the well-known delta(13)C drop at the Permian/Triassic boundary. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We report here a test of the hypothesis that the extent of organic matter preservation in continental margin sediments is controlled by the average period accumulating particles reside in oxic porewater immediately beneath the water/sediment interface. Oxygen penetration depths, organic element compositions, and mineral surface areas were determined for 16 sediment cores collected along an offshore transect across the Washington continental shelf, slope, and adjacent Cascadia Basin. Individual amino acid, sugar, and pollen distributions were analyzed for a 11 to 12 cm horizon from each core, and C-14-based sediment accumulation rates and stable carbon isotope compositions were determined from depth profiles within a subset of six cores from representative sites. Sediment accumulation rates decreased, and dissolved O-2 penetration depths increased offshore along the sampling transect. As a result, oxygen exposure times (OET) increased seaward from decades (mid-shelf and upper slope) to more than a thousand years (outer Cascadia Basin). Organic contents and compositions were essentially constant within individual sediment cores but varied consistently with location. In particular, organic carbon/surface area ratios decreased progressively offshore and with increasing OET. Three independent compositional parameters demonstrated that the remnant organic matter in farther offshore sediments is more degraded. Both concentration and compositional patterns indicated that sedimentary organic matter exhibits a distinct and reproducible "oxic effect" OET helps integrate and explain organic matter preservation in accumulating continental margin sediments and hence provides a useful tool for assessing transfer of organic matter from the biosphere to the geosphere.},

abstract = {Modern low-oxygen marine systems exhibit patterns of molybdenum-uranium covariation that can be linked to specific attributes and processes of the depositional system, including (1) variation in benthic redox conditions, (2) the operation of particulate shuttles within the water column, and (3) the evolution of watermass chemistry. The importance of these factors in each depositional system can be assessed both from the degree of enrichment of authigenic molybdenum (Moauth) and uranium (Uauth) and from the (Mo/U)auth ratio of the sediment relative to the seawater Mo/U molar ratio of {\~{}} 7.5-7.9. In open-ocean systems with suboxic bottomwaters, Uauth enrichment tends to exceed that of Moauth owing to onset of Uauth accumulation at the Fe(II)-Fe(III) redox boundary, resulting in sediment (Mo/U)auth ratios less than that of seawater. As bottomwaters become increasingly reducing and at least occasionally sulfidic, the rate of accumulation of Moauth increases relative to that of Uauth, and sediment (Mo/U)auth ratios equal or exceed that of seawater. In restricted marine systems with permanently sulfidic deepwaters, the relative enrichment of Moauth and Uauth depends on additional factors. In the Cariaco Basin, which has an aqueous Mo/U ratio similar to that of seawater, the operation of a particulate Mn-Fe-oxyhydroxide shuttle serves to accelerate the transfer of Mo to the seafloor, leading to strong enrichments in Moauth relative to Uauth. In the Black Sea, the chemistry of the deep watermass has evolved to the point where its aqueous Mo/U ratio is only {\~{}} 0.04 that of seawater, as a consequence of which sediments deposited under deepwater influence are depleted in Moauth relative to Uauth. These Mo-U covariation patterns can be used to gain a better understanding of the watermass attributes and processes of ancient low-oxygen marine systems. Analysis of anoxic facies from two North American paleomarine systems, the Late Pennsylvanian Midcontinent Sea (LPMS) and the Late Devonian Seaway (LDS), reveals authigenic Mo-U relationships similar to those of the modern marine environments above, implying similar redox and hydrographic controls. The observed patterns are consistent with laterally unconfined circulation and strong watermass exchange within the LPMS, and with markedly restricted deepwater circulation in silled basins of the LDS. Patterns of authigenic Mo-U covariation may prove useful in analysis of other paleoceanographic systems to reveal aspects of watermass composition and environmental dynamics.},

abstract = {Marine carbonate precipitation occurs in three basic modes: abiotic (or quasi-abiotic), biotically induced, and biotically controlled. On a geologic scale, these precipitation modes combine to form three carbonate production systems, or "factories" in the benthic environment: (1) tropical shallow-water factory, dominated by biotically controlled (mainly photo-autotrophic) and abiotic precipitates; (2) cool-water factory, dominated by biotically controlled (mainly heterotrophic) precipitates; and (3) mud-mound factory, dominated by biotically induced (mainly microbial) and abiotic precipitates. Sediment accumulations of the factories differ in composition, geometry, and facies patterns, and some of these differences appear prominently in seismic data, thus facilitating subsurface prediction. The characteristic accumulation of the tropical factory is the flat-topped, often reef-rimmed platform. In cool-water systems, reefs in high-energy settings are scarce and hydrodynamic influence dominates, producing seaward-sloping shelves and deep-water sediment drifts often armored by skeletal framework. The typical accumulation of the mud-mound factory is groups of mounds in deeper water. Where the mud-mound factory expands into shallow water, it forms rimmed platforms similar to the tropical factory. The tropical factory is most productive; the mud-mound factory reaches 80-90{\%}, and the cool-water factory 20-30{\%} of the tropical growth rate. The three factories represent end members connected by transitions in space. Transitions in time are linked to biotic evolution.},

abstract = {In this study the sulfur cycle in the organic-rich mud belt underlying the highly productive upwelling waters of the Namibian shelf is quantified using a 1D reaction-transport model. The model calculates vertical concentration and reaction rate profiles in the top 500 cm of sediment which are compared to a comprehensive dataset which includes carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and iron compounds as well as sulfate reduction (SR) rates and stable sulfur isotopes (32S, 34S). The sulfur dynamics in the well-mixed surface sediments are strongly influenced by the activity of the large sulfur bacteria Thiomargarita namibiensis which oxidize sulfide (H2S) to sulfate (SO42 -) using sea water nitrate (NO3-) as the terminal electron acceptor. Microbial sulfide oxidation (SOx) is highly efficient, and the model predicts intense cycling between SO42 - and H2S driven by coupled SR and SOx at rates exceeding 6.0 mol S m-2 y-1. More than 96{\%} of the SR is supported by SOx, and only 2-3{\%} of the SO42 - pool diffuses directly into the sediment from the sea water. A fraction of the SO42 - produced by Thiomargarita is drawn down deeper into the sediment where it is used to oxidize methane anaerobically, thus preventing high methane concentrations close to the sediment surface. Only a small fraction of total H2S production is trapped as sedimentary sulfide, mainly pyrite (FeS2) and organic sulfur (Sorg) (∼0.3 wt.{\%}), with a sulfur burial efficiency which is amongst the lowest values reported for marine sediments ({\textless}1{\%}). Yet, despite intense SR, FeS2 and Sorg show an isotope composition of ∼5 ‰ at 500 cm depth. These heavy values were simulated by assuming that a fraction of the solid phase sulfur exchanges isotopes with the dissolved sulfide pool. An enrichment in H2S of 34S towards the sediment-water interface suggests that Thiomargarita preferentially remove H232S from the pore water. A fractionation of 20-30‰ was estimated for SOx ($\epsilon$SOx) with the model, along with a maximum fractionation for SR ($\epsilon$SR-max) of 100‰. These values are far higher than previous laboratory-based estimates for these processes. Mass balance calculations indicate negligible disproportionation of autochthonous elemental sulfur; an explanation routinely cited in the literature to account for the large fractionations in SR. Instead, the model indicates that repeated multi-stepped sulfide oxidation and intracellular disproportionation by Thiomargarita could, in principle, allow the measured isotope data to be simulated using much lower fractionations for $\epsilon$SOx (5‰) and $\epsilon$SR (78‰). {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Topic 6 summarises the major robust findings and remain- ing key uncertainties in this assessment. A schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of and responses to climate change, and their linkages, is shown in Figure I.1. At the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages clockwise, i.e. to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased under- standing of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages also counterclockwise, i.e. to evaluate possible development path- ways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.},

abstract = {A newly studied Permian-Triassic (P-Tr) boundary section in Jameson Land, East Greenland, contains an abundant and well-preserved marine fauna as well as terrestrial palynomorphs. For the first time it is possible to compare the biotic crises of the marine and terrestrial realms using the same samples from the same section. The sediments record a negative excursion in $\delta$13Ccarb values of 8‰–9‰, and in $\delta$13Corg values of 10‰–11‰. The presence of the conodont Hindeodus parvus, combined with the $\delta$13Ccarb record, enables correlation with the proposed global stratotype section at Meishan. This shows that the Greenland section is the most expanded P-Tr section known. Collapse of the marine and terrestrial ecosystems took between 10 and 60 k.y. It took a further few hundred thousand years for the final disappearance of Permian floral elements. Collapse of the terrestrial and marine ecosystems began at the same stratigraphic level and preceded the sharp negative excursion in the $\delta$13C record.},

abstract = {The uppermost Permian strata of the Abadeh section in Iran consist of 56 m of skeletal limestone (Abadehian), that grades upward into 18 m of grey, bioturbated lime mudstone (Djulfian), which in turn grades upward to 18 m of red, nodular wackestone (Dorashamian) containing an abundant pelagic fauna. The overlying lowermost Triassic includes two enigmatic layers at its base. Immediately above the boundary is a 1-m-thick layer of inorganically precipitated synsedimentary carbonate cement. The cement is composed of 10-20-cm-long crystals oriented either perpendicular to the bedding or as dome-shaped features resembling botryoids. About 0.5 m of wackestone overlies the cement layer. The second layer is a 1.5-m-thick grainstone overlying the cement horizon and consists of recrystallised spherical grains (ooids or peloids). The remainder of unit [`]A' is composed of 100+ m of grey, bioturbated to nodular lime mudstone. The lithofacies succession of the uppermost Permian is interpreted to represent deposition under increasing water depth, related to rising of relative sea level, which led to drowning of the carbonate platform to below storm wave base. Sedimentologic characteristics, lithology, wide distribution, and slow sedimentation rates indicate that strata immediately below the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary (Dorashamian interval) were deposited in deep, oxygenated waters. The enigmatic lowermost Triassic synsedimentary carbonate cement and grainstone layers are interpreted to have been deposited in shallow waters, indicating a rapid and major drop in relative sea level at the end of Permian time in this area, followed by a relative sea-level rise during the earliest Triassic. Precipitation of synsedimentary cement immediately above the P-T boundary in Iran and elsewhere (South China) suggests a global change in ocean chemistry. One possible explanation is that dissolved calcium and bicarbonate concentrations in seawater increased sufficiently to promote spontaneous carbonate precipitation, a rare event in the Phanerozoic but common during Precambrian time. Alternatively, a massive heating event could have resulted in CO2 degassing and decreases in oceanic carbonate solubility, both leading to inorganic, synsedimentary carbonate precipitation. Inorganic precipitation of synsedimentary carbonate cement may indicate that biochemical production of carbonate was halted due to the P-T boundary events. Our study indicates that shallow and moderately deep waters during the latest Permian were well oxygenated in the open ocean setting of the central Tethys Sea in Iran. Therefore, P-T mass extinction scenarios that invoke upon widespread marine anoxia should be viewed with caution.},

abstract = {The Permian-Triassic mass extinction was the most severe biotic crisis in the past 500 million years. Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the crisis, but few account for the spectrum of extinction selectivity and subsequent recovery. Here we show that selective losses are best accounted for by a combination of lethally warm, shallow waters and anoxic deep waters that acted to severely restrict the habitable area to a narrow mid-water refuge zone. The relative tolerance of groups to this double whammy provides the first clear explanation for the selective extinction losses during this double-pulsed crisis and also the fitful recovery. Thus, high temperature intolerant shallow-water dwellers, such as corals, large foraminifers and radiolarians were eliminated first whilst high temperature tolerant ostracods thrived except in anoxic deeper-waters. In contrast, hypoxia tolerant but temperature intolerant small foraminifers were driven from shallow-waters but thrived on dysoxic slopes margins. Only those mollusc groups, which are tolerant of both hypoxia and high temperatures, were able to thrive in the immediate aftermath of the extinction. Limited Early Triassic benthic recovery was restricted to mid-water depths and coincided with intervals of cooling and deepening of water column anoxia that expanded the habitable mid-water refuge zone.},

@article{Worsley2004,
abstract = {Permian waning of the low-latitude Alleghenian/Variscan/Hercynian orogenesis led to a long collisional orogeny gap that cut down the availability of chemically weatherable fresh silicate rock resulting in a high-CO2 atmosphere and global warming. The correspondingly reduced delivery of nutrients to the biosphere caused further increases in CO2 and warming. Melting of polar ice curtailed sinking of O2- and nutrient-rich cold brines while pole-to-equator thermal gradients weakened. Wind shear and associated wind-driven upwelling lessened, further diminishing productivity and carbon burial. As the Earth warmed, dry climates expanded to mid-latitudes, causing latitudinal expansion of the Ferrel circulation cell at the expense of the polar cell. Increased coastal evaporation generated O2- and nutrient-deficient warm saline bottom water (WSBW) and delivered it to a weakly circulating deep ocean. Warm, deep currents delivered ever more heat to high latitudes until polar sinking of cold water was replaced by upwelling WSBW. With the loss of polar sinking, the ocean was rapidly filled with WSBW that became increasingly anoxic and finally euxinic by the end of the Permian. Rapid incursion of WSBW could have produced {\~{}}20 m of thermal expansion of the oceans, generating the well-documented marine transgression that flooded embayments in dry, hot Pangaean mid-latitudes. The flooding further increased WSBW production and anoxia, and brought that anoxic water onto the shelves. Release of CO2 from the Siberian traps and methane from clathrates below the warming ocean bottom sharply enhanced the already strong greenhouse. Increasingly frequent and powerful cyclonic storms mined upwelling high-latitude heat and released it to the atmosphere. That heat, trapped by overlying clouds of its own making, suggests complete breakdown of the dry polar cell. Resulting rapid and intense polar warming caused or contributed to extinction of the remaining latest Permian coal forests that could not migrate any farther poleward because of light limitations. Loss of water stored by the forests led to aquifer drainage, adding another {\~{}}5 m to the transgression. Non-peat-forming vegetation survived at the newly moist poles. Climate feedback from the coal-forest extinction further intensified warmth, contributing to delayed biotic recovery that generally did not begin until mid-Triassic, but appears to have resumed first at high latitudes late in the Early Triassic. Current quantitative models fail to generate high-latitude warmth and so do not produce the chain of events we outline in this paper. Future quantitative modeling addressing factors such as polar cloudiness, increased poleward heat transport by deep water and its upwelling by cyclonic storms, and sustainable mid-latitude sinking of warm brines to promote anoxia, warming, and thermal expansion of deep water may more closely simulate conditions indicated by geological and paleontological data.},

abstract = {In a bog deposit containing siderite and vivianite, both minerals consist of a solid solution with Mn2+and Ca2+. It is found that Mn is preferentially concentrated in the carbonate and also that the compositional variation within single samples is large. High Fe2+concentrations are found in the pore water, while H2S is absent in agreement with thermodynamic predictions. Calculated saturation states for pure end-member minerals show near equilibrium with respect to rhodochrosite while with siderite up to a magnitude of supersaturation is found. Also strong supersaturation is found with respect to vivianite while with Mn3(PO4)2strong subsaturation prevails. Supersaturation with both siderite and vivianite cannot be explained by solid solution alone, and it is shown that their saturation states are largely controlled by pH variations. Processes which may cause the precipitation of siderite within and not outside the bog are reduction of ferric oxyhydroxides and dissolution of CaCO3from the solid carbonate. The present data do not allow a quantitative expression for the importance of these processes. In a particular case, however, it could be shown that equilibrium with calcite controls the saturation state for siderite. {\textcopyright} 1980.},

abstract = {To better constrain the spatial and stratigraphic distribution of the depositional facies, a synthesis of outcrop and subsurface data for the depositional system of the Upper Dalan Member and Kangan Formation in the Zagros to the offshore Fars area was carried out. The areas that were studied in detail are the Kuh-e Surmeh and Kuh-e Dena sections of the Zagros Mountains, Iran, and their equivalent in the offshore Fars subsurface. The observations and interpretations based on these sections were then integrated with the regional subsurface descriptions, interpretations and models, and related to the Upper Khuff system across the region. The synthesis of the core descriptions and the Zagros outcrop facies data, together with integration of published data resulted in the definition and characterisation of 16 principal facies associations that were used to interpret the depositional environment. Qualitative comparisons of Upper Khuff sections and subsurface cores across the Zagros area, offshore Fars and Middle East Gulf region, showed that this classification of depositional facies is applicable at a larger regional scale and useful in rapid regional comparisons and correlations of the Upper Khuff depositional systems. The large range in documented facies types reflects the great variety in depositional systems and sub-systems that were present across the Khuff platform. The range also shows the temporal evolution of the Khuff environments and palaeoecological conditions from the Permian to the Triassic. The general importance of microbial facies is highlighted and a variety of microbial facies are defined. These microbial events provide reservoir and regional scale isochronous marker horizons that are correlatable over large distances. These microbial facies are associated with periods of poor oxygenation and restriction, but nevertheless can occupy a range of environments from intertidal to mid-to outer-ramp settings. Several significant stratigraphic surfaces were picked and correlated based on the detailed core descriptions, the bio- and ecostratigraphic analysis, wireline logs, stratigraphic stacking patterns and the regional understanding of other Upper Dalan-Kangan/Upper Khuff sections in the region. The correlations in cored wells for the Upper Dalan cycles are supported by a well-constrained biostratigraphic framework. Four large third-order stacking cycles (Cycle IV to Cycle I) were defined on the basis of cycles bounded by surfaces representing base-level and accommodation potential minima. The correlations and stratigraphic analysis suggest that the major stratigraphic trends and large-scale stratigraphic architecture are relatively isopachous ("layer-cake") at the production scales, a function of the almost flat platform geometry. At a larger scale, significant changes in thickness occur: either thickening towards palaeodepocentres or thinning with onlap towards palaeohighs. At this large-scale, progradation of the oolite shoals occurred during the late highstands in the large accommodation areas. However, on the topographic palaeohighs and platform tops, the main stratigraphic locations of the oolite shoal are in the trangressive and maximum accommodation zones of the cycles. Integrating the facies and stratigraphic interpretations, conceptual depositional models have been constructed for the main stratigraphic intervals. From these interpretations and models it is evident that there were significant changes in platform type/geometry, facies organisation and climate from Cycle VI through to Cycle I. At a large scale the Late Permian depositional setting of the Upper Khuff was organised into a platform profile that gently deepened from the south with a platform-top interior zone, a platform-top edge zone, an intrashelf low, and then rose again in the north with palaeohighs around Kuh-e Surmeh and Kuh-e Dena (structurally-controlled basement highs). There was however a major change in the platform profile in the Early Triassic which had a monoclinal ramp platform geometry which opened to the north to deeper-marine conditions with the absence of effective palaeohigh barriers. These two large-scale palaeogeographic profiles controlled the overall distribution of facies belts across the platform. This change in platform profile was coincident with other events within the lowest part of the Kangan Formation (Triassic Khuff Formation of the Arabian Plate) at the Permian-Triassic Boundary, including: (1) major facies changes on the platform tops with the appearance of thrombolites and associated microbial grainstones; (2) major facies changes in the northern shelf edge areas where there is a change from shallow-water high-energy grainy facies to deeper-water mid-ramp muddy facies; (3) change in pattern of relative stratigraphic thickness; and (4) appearance of high gamma-ray shales in the eastern Zagros subsurface area. These events are all consistent with a major flooding across the Permian-Triassic Boundary causing: (1) drowning of palaeohighs; (2) encroachment of anoxic waters into the intrashelf lows; (3) termination of bioaccumulations at the shelf edges; (4) flooding the platform tops with more grainy facies, and developing microbial facies across the shelf; and (5) the quasi-synchronous end-Permian mass extinction. Based on the stratigraphic distributions of the biostratigraphically significant fauna and flora, age determinations are interpreted for the main stratigraphic intervals between the Lower Dalan to top Dalan (Lower Khuff to Permian Upper Khuff). Palaeoecologically, five biofacies types have been defined based on the faunal and algal content, the foraminiferal diversity, their sedimentological context and palaeoenvironmental interpretation. This generalised classification is applied to the depositional models developed from the sedimentological analysis and has enabled a validation of the depositional schemes by identifying palaeoenvironmental trends which are not always clear from the sedimentological analysis alone. The analysis of the biofacies distribution has allowed the subdivision of the Upper Dalan Member (Permian Upper Khuff) into six different 'palaeoecological systems' that correspond to characteristic faunal assemblages and biofacies sets. The main characteristics of the six palaeoecological systems, and their lateral variability, have been documented. The limits of the defined intervals correspond to important sequence stratigraphic events and markers at various stratigraphic scales. This relationship allowed the integration of ecostratigraphic events to the previously defined sequence stratigraphical framework based on the sedimentological and stratigraphic analysis, and hence confirms and refines the stratigraphic correlations. A synthesis of stratigraphic, depositional and diagenetic facies, lithological, isotopic, spectral gamma-ray wireline logs and palaeoecological data suggests that there is no major stratigraphic gap between the KS3 and the KS2 stratigraphic intervals, and hence between the Permian and Triassic periods. In the numerous subsurface sections, and outcrop investigations in the Zagros, no evidence for a major unconformity/disconformity or stratigraphic surface is associated with the Permian-Triassic Boundary; furthermore the extinction of Permian fauna occurs within a grainstone body. The faunistic analysis shows that the Permian Fauna Extinction (PFE) event generally occurs within a strongly calcite-cemented and microbially mediated ooid grainstone rich in intraclasts in the lower part of the KS2 sequence. Above the PFE event is a thin Permian azoic interval, followed by the Triassic faunal recovery and associated with the Early Triassic thrombolitic microbial event. In the Zagros area the PFE occurs within pyrite-bearing muds under poorly oxygenated conditions. The outcrop data also show a similar pattern with a thin azoic interval occurring between the last Permian taxa and the first Triassic taxa. In the Zagros outcrops there is a general muddying (deepening-upwards) from the Upper Permian to the Lower Triassic. The analysis suggests there is a low (third) order transgression between upper KS3 stratigraphic interval (Upper Permian) and the KS2 stratigraphic interval (Lower Triassic), and that the 'Permian-Triassic oceanic event' is located in the late third-order TST.},

Ikaite precipitation in the marine environment requires near-freezing temperatures (not higher than 4°C), high alkalinity, increased levels of orthophosphate, and high P(CO2).

Data previously reported as 11 to 16°C (assuming $\delta$(w) = 0.0‰SMOW) yield paleotemperatures ranging from -1 to 5°C, squarely in the range of ikaite stability.

abstract = {Abstract Anthropogenic rise in the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere leads to global warming and acidification of the oceans. Ocean acidification (OA) is harmful to many organisms but especially to those that build massive skeletons of calcium carbonate, such as reef corals. Here, we test the recent suggestion that OA leads not only to declining calcification of reef corals and reduced growth rates of reefs but may also have been a trigger of ancient reef crises and mass extinctions in the sea. We analyse the fossil record of biogenic reefs and marine organisms to (1) assess the timing and intensity of ancient reef crises, (2) check which reef crises were concurrent with inferred pulses of carbon dioxide concentrations and (3) evaluate the correlation between reef crises and mass extinctions and their selectivity in terms of inferred physiological buffering. We conclude that four of five global metazoan reef crises in the last 500 Myr were probably at least partially governed by OA and rapid global warming. However, only two of the big five mass extinctions show geological evidence of OA.},

abstract = {Many aspects of the carbon cycle can be assessed from temporal changes in the (13)C/(12)C ratio of oceanic bicarbonate. (13)C/(12)C can temporarily rise when large amounts of (13)C-depleted photosynthetic organic matter are buried at enhanced rates, and can decrease if phytomass is rapidly oxidized or if low (13)C is rapidly released from methane clathrates. Assuming that variations of the marine (13)C/(12)C ratio are directly recorded in carbonate rocks, thousands of carbon isotope analyses of late Precambrian examples have been published to correlate these otherwise undatable strata and to document perturbations to the carbon cycle just before the great expansion of metazoan life. Low (13)C/(12)C in some Neoproterozoic carbonates is considered evidence of carbon cycle perturbations unique to the Precambrian. These include complete oxidation of all organic matter in the ocean and complete productivity collapse such that low-(13)C/(12)C hydrothermal CO(2) becomes the main input of carbon. Here we compile all published oxygen and carbon isotope data for Neoproterozoic marine carbonates, and consider them in terms of processes known to alter the isotopic composition during transformation of the initial precipitate into limestone/dolostone. We show that the combined oxygen and carbon isotope systematics are identical to those of well-understood Phanerozoic examples that lithified in coastal pore fluids, receiving a large groundwater influx of photosynthetic carbon from terrestrial phytomass. Rather than being perturbations to the carbon cycle, widely reported decreases in (13)C/(12)C in Neoproterozoic carbonates are more easily interpreted in the same way as is done for Phanerozoic examples. This influx of terrestrial carbon is not apparent in carbonates older than approximately 850 Myr, so we infer an explosion of photosynthesizing communities on late Precambrian land surfaces. As a result, biotically enhanced weathering generated carbon-bearing soils on a large scale and their detrital sedimentation sequestered carbon. This facilitated a rise in O(2) necessary for the expansion of multicellular life.},

Driftwood and large floating algae are eliminated as possible rafts because fossil wood is found mainly concentrated in nearshore areas of the basins and large algal masses have not been observed. Rafting by icebergs is considered unlikely in view of the global lack of tillites and related glacial deposits of this age. Our interpretation is that seasonal ice, formed in winter along stream courses and strandlines, incorporated clasts which, during the melt season, were dropped into muddy sediments in both basins. Eromanga fine-sediment and lonestone clasts in places were reworked subsequently by storm activity, producing lag concentrations of large clasts and associated sand lenses, both lying above local erosion surfaces. In the Carpentaria Basin, local dumping of sediment from raft surfaces resulted in accumulation of pods of small clasts. {\textless}br /{\textgreater}{\textless}br /{\textgreater}Three zones can be identified for the Early Cretaceous climate of eastern Australia: (1) a very cold southern region, at latitudes above about 72 {\^{A}}° S, characterized by meteoric waters possibly originating as Antarctic glacial meltwaters; (2) a zone of strongly seasonal climates, with freezing winters and warm summers, between about 72{\^{A}}° and 53{\^{A}}° S. Lat.; and (3) a mid-latitude zone (below about 50{\^{A}}° S. Lat.), where freezing temperatures were not common. However, owing to scant biostratigraphic control on the successions, the time span of specific climates in both the cold and the seasonal zones cannot be determined and probably existed only for short intervals.},

abstract = {Stromatolites may be Earth's oldest macroscopic fossils; however, it remains controversial what, if any, biological processes are recorded in their morphology. Although the biological interpretation of many stromatolite morphologies is confounded by the influence of sedimentation, conical stromatolites form in the absence of sedimentation and are, therefore, considered to be the most robust records of biophysical processes. A qualitative similarity between conical stromatolites and some modern microbial mats suggests a photosynthetic origin for ancient stromatolites. To better understand and interpret ancient fossils, we seek a quantitative relationship between the geometry of conical stromatolites and the biophysical processes that control their growth. We note that all modern conical stromatolites and many that formed in the last 2.8 billion years display a characteristic centimeter-scale spacing between neighboring structures. To understand this prominent-but hitherto uninterpreted-organization, we consider the role of diffusion in mediating competition between stromatolites. Having confirmed this model through laboratory experiments and field observation, we find that organization of a field of stromatolites is set by a diffusive time scale over which individual structures compete for nutrients, thus linking form to physiology. The centimeter-scale spacing between modern and ancient stromatolites corresponds to a rhythmically fluctuating metabolism with a period of approximately 20 hr. The correspondence between the observed spacing and the day length provides quantitative support for the photosynthetic origin of conical stromatolites throughout geologic time.},

abstract = {The black shale submember of core shales of Pennsylvanian Kansas-type cyclothems is highly enriched in redox-sensitive trace elements (TEs) relative to the overlying gray shale submember as well as to many other modern and ancient organic-rich deposits. Controls on trace-element behavior in the black shale can be inferred from trace-element enrichment factors (EFs, relative to gray shale) and the relationship of TEs to total organic carbon (TOC). Most TEs conformed to one of two patterns: (1) Mo, U, V, Zn, and Pb exhibited moderate EFs and strong covariation with TOC in samples having {\textless}10 wt.{\%} TOC but large EFs and weak covariation with TOC in samples having {\textgreater}10 wt.{\%} TOC; and (2) Cu, Ni, Cr, and Co exhibited low EFs and moderate to strong covariation with TOC in all samples. These patterns are inferred to represent different responses to benthic redox conditions. The first pattern is characteristic of TEs of "strong euxinic affinity", i.e., those taken up in solid solution by Fe-sulfide or involved in other reactions catalyzed by free H2S, and resident mainly in authigenic phases, whereas the second pattern is characteristic of TEs of "weak euxinic affinity", i.e., those not strongly influenced by the presence of free H2S and resident mainly in the organic carbon or detrital fractions of the sediment. These inferences allowed development of a multiproxy technique for assessing redox facies in black shale samples: euxinic conditions were considered to have existed if at least two of four "redox-indicator" trace elements (Mo, U, V, Zn) showed euxinic levels of enrichment, and nonsulfidic anoxic conditions were inferred otherwise. The validity of the procedure is indicated by (1) agreement among all four "redox indicators" for a large majority of samples (69{\%} of 185); (2) among samples yielding a mixed redox signal, a systematic sequence of TE enrichment (V???Zn???Mo???U); and (3) for TEs of "weak euxinic affinity", reduced variance among samples representing each redox facies. Sequential enrichment may be a response to differential redox thresholds for accumulation (e.g., V) or postdepositional remobilization of trace elements (e.g., U) and may provide a basis for finer assessment of redox conditions in low-oxygen paleoenvironments than permitted by simple classification schemes. The multiproxy procedure for redox-facies analysis developed in this study is likely to be more reliable than widely used single-proxy indicators based on trace elements (e.g., Mo, authigenic U, or V/(V+Ni)) or C-S-Fe systematics (e.g., S/TOC or DOP). ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The end-Triassic extinction (ETE), one of the five largest Phanerozoic mass extinctions, is associated with rapid and severe environmental change, but existing data permit alternative models of causation. Volcanism in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) has been proposed as the main trigger, but direct evidence for this linkage is scarce. To help constrain scenarios for the ETE and other Triassic-Jurassic boundary (TJB) events, we obtained a temporally highly resolved, multidisciplinary dataset from the Kendlbachgraben section in the Northern Calcareous Alps in Austria. The section belongs to the same paleogeographic unit (Eiberg Basin) and share similar stratigraphy with the recently selected base Jurassic Global Stratotype Section and Point at Kuhjoch. Micromineralogic study of the topmost bed of the Rhaetian K{\"{o}}ssen Formation revealed pseudomorphs of altered, euhedral pyroxene and amphibole crystals. Their well-faceted morphology is consistent with their origin from distal mafic volcanic ash fallout. Spherical grains were also observed in the same bed, likely representing clay-altered volcanic glass. Clay minerals of this bed include low- to medium-charged smectite and Mg-vermiculite, both typical alteration products of mafic rocks. The same bed yielded a rare earth element pattern that differs from all other levels in an enrichment of heavy REEs, hinting at some minor contribution from mafic magmatic material. These features from a layer that was deposited very near to the TJB are interpreted as direct evidence of CAMP volcanism, coeval or immediately preceding the ETE and the initial negative carbon isotope anomaly. The kaolinite-dominated clay mineral spectrum of the overlying boundary mudstone records intensive weathering under hot and humid greenhouse conditions. Redox-sensitive minor and trace elements do not support the development of widespread anoxia in the studied section. Although pyrite is common in several layers, framboid size indicates formation within a reductive zone, below the sediment/water interface, rather than in an anoxic water column. Our data provide a direct link between uppermost Triassic marine strata and CAMP-derived material. They support scenarios where CAMP volcanism induced climate and other environmental change, which in turn triggered the ETE and that is also reflected in the carbon isotope anomalies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

A large compilation of Ca isotope ratios for modern carbonates, incorporating more than 50 new measurements, represents the quantitatively important components of the system. With this data set, distinct Ca isotope ratios are identified for different types of marine carbonate, the balance of which has changed over time with shifts between calcite and aragonite seas and with the development of pelagic calcification during the Mesozoic. It is suggested that large-scale changes in the Ca isotope ratio of seawater, as exemplified by that in the Carboniferous, were no longer possible after Jurassic time because of the generation of a deep-sea calcite sink expressed by deposition of foraminiferal–coccolith ooze across the world ocean.

abstract = {New delta(13)C(org) analyses of two boundary sections between the late Permian Kapp Starostin Formation and the early Triassic Vardebukta Formation of western Spitsbergen confirm field evidence that their contact is a conformable one. Thus, contrary to previous reports, some Spitsbergen sections contain a complete record of the environmental and faunal changes during the crisis interval of the end Permian mass extinction. No environmental deterioration is recorded in the late Permian until near the end of the terminal Changxingian Stage, whereupon the abundant siliceous sponge fauna of the Kapp Starostin Formation disappears along with the deep-burrowing fauna responsible for the Zoophycus trace fossil. A low diversity dysaerobic trace fossil assemblage is briefly developed before a transition to finely laminated, pyritic facies immediately beneath the Permo-Triassic boundary. Analysis of the S/C ratios from the laminated strata suggests that free H2S was present in the water column (euxinic conditions) even in relatively nearshore settings subject to storm sandstone deposition. The mass extinction crisis in Spitsbergen is therefore coincident with the extensive development of oxygen-poor conditions in the water column and compares closely, both in timing and nature, with the crisis seen in lower latitude Tethyan settings. However, the subsequent aftermath and recovery in the Boreal sections of Spitsbergen was more rapid than in Tethys. Thus, a shoreface sandstone body within the Dienerian Stage contains an appreciable diversity of fauna (by the standards of the early Triassic), including bryozoans, calcareous algae and deep infaunal bivalves, that suggests the marine ecosystem recovery began earliest in higher palaeolatitudes.},

abstract = {Secondary marine adaptation is a major pattern in amniote evolution, accompanied by specific bone histological adaptations. In the aftermath of the end-Permian extinction, diverse marine reptiles evolved early in the Triassic. Plesiosauria is the most diverse and one of the longest-lived clades of marine reptiles, but its bone histology is least known among the major marine amniote clades. Plesiosaurians had a unique and puzzling body plan, sporting four evenly shaped pointed flippers and (in most clades) a small head on a long, stiffened neck. The flippers were used as hydrofoils in underwater flight. A wide temporal, morphological, and morphometric gap separates plesiosaurians from their closest relatives (basal pistosaurs, Bobosaurus ). For nearly two centuries, plesiosaurians were thought to appear suddenly in the earliest Jurassic after the end-Triassic extinctions. We describe the first Triassic plesiosaurian, from the Rhaetian of Germany, and compare its long bone histology to that of later plesiosaurians sampled for this study. The new taxon is recovered as a basal member of the Pliosauridae, revealing that diversification of plesiosaurians was a Triassic event and that several lineages must have crossed into the Jurassic. Plesiosaurian histology is strikingly uniform and different from stem sauropterygians. Histology suggests the concurrent evolution of fast growth and an elevated metabolic rate as an adaptation to cruising and efficient foraging in the open sea. The new specimen corroborates the hypothesis that open ocean life of plesiosaurians facilitated their survival of the end-Triassic extinctions.},

abstract = {Studies of authigenic phosphorus (P) minerals in marine sediments typically focus on authigenic carbonate fluorapatite, which is considered to be the major sink for P in marine sediments and can easily be semi-quantitatively extracted with the SEDEX sequential extraction method. The role of other potentially important authigenic P phases, such as the reduced iron (Fe) phosphate mineral vivianite (Fe(II)3(PO4)*8H2O) has so far largely been ignored in marine systems. This is, in part, likely due to the fact that the SEDEX method does not distinguish between vivianite and P associated with Fe-oxides. Here, we show that vivianite can be quantified in marine sediments by combining the SEDEX method with microscopic and spectroscopic techniques such as micro X-ray fluorescence ($\mu$XRF) elemental mapping of resin-embedded sediments, as well as scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). We further demonstrate that resin embedding of vertically intact sediment sub-cores enables the use of synchrotron-based microanalysis (X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy) to differentiate between different P burial phases in aquatic sediments. Our results reveal that vivianite represents a major burial sink for P below a shallow sulfate/methane transition zone in Bothnian Sea sediments, accounting for 40-50{\%} of total P burial. We further show that anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) drives a sink-switching from Fe-oxide bound P to vivianite by driving the release of both phosphate (AOM with sulfate and Fe-oxides) and ferrous Fe (AOM with Fe-oxides) to the pore water allowing supersaturation with respect to vivianite to be reached. The vivianite in the sediment contains significant amounts of manganese ({\~{}}4-8wt.{\%}), similar to vivianite obtained from freshwater sediments. Our results indicate that methane dynamics play a key role in providing conditions that allow for vivianite authigenesis in coastal surface sediments. We suggest that vivianite may act as an important burial sink for P in brackish coastal environments worldwide.},

abstract = {Late Paleocene and Early Eocene climates and ecosystems underwent significant change during several transient global warming phases, associated with rapidly increasing atmospheric carbon concentrations, of which the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; similar to 55.5 Ma) is best studied. While biotic response to the PETM as a whole (similar to 170 kyrs) has been relatively well documented, variations during the PETM have been neglected. Here we present organic dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) distribution patterns across two stratigraphically expanded PETM sections from the New Jersey Shelf, Bass River and Wilson Lake. Many previously studied sites show a uniform abundance of the thermophilic and presumably heterotrophic taxon Apectodinium that spans the entire carbon isotope excursion (CIE) of the PETM. In contrast, the New Jersey sections show large variations in abundances of many taxa. during the PETM, including the new species Florentinia reichartii that we formally propose. We infer paleoecological preferences of taxa that show temporal abundance peaks, both qualitative and absolute quantitative, from empirical as well as statistical information, i.e., principle (PCA) and canonical correspondence analyses (CCA). In the CCAs, we combine the dinocyst data with previously published environmental proxy data from these locations, such as TEX86 paleothermometry, magnetic susceptibility and sedimentary size fraction. The combined information supports previous inferences that sea level rose during the PETM, but also indicates a (regional) increase in fresh-water runoff that started similar to 10 kyr after the onset of the CIE, and perhaps precession-paced cycles in sea surface productivity. The highly variable dinocyst assemblages of the PETM contrast with rather stable Upper Paleocene assemblages, which suggests that carbon input caused a dynamic climate state, at least regionally.},

abstract = {Human and industrial development over the past hundred years has led to a huge increase in fossil fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, causing a dramatic increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. This increased CO2 is believed to be responsible for a significant rise in global temperature over the past several decades. Global-scale climate modeling suggests that the temperature increase will continue, at least over the next few hundred years, leading to glacial melting and rising sea levels. Increased atmospheric CO2 also leads to ocean acidification, which will have drastic consequences for marine ecosystems. In an attempt to solve these problems, many have proposed the large-scale sequestration of CO2 from our atmosphere. This introductory article presents a summary of some of the evidence linking increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration to global warming and ocean acidification and our efforts to stem this rise though CO2 sequestration.},

abstract = {Several phosphate minerals have been investigated for their usefulness in geochronology and thermochronology by the fission track method. Of these, apatite [Ca5(PO4)3(F,Cl,OH)], has proved pre-eminently suitable for this purpose for reasons discussed below. Apatite was one of the first minerals, amongst many others, to be investigated for fission track dating by Fleischer and Price (1964) and has subsequently become by far the most important of all the minerals used for dating by this method. The usefulness of apatites for fission track dating arises from their near-universal tendency to concentrate uranium within their structure at the time of crystallization and their widespread occurrence in all of the major rock groups. Price and Walker (1963) first recognized the possibility that the accumulation of radiation damage tracks in natural minerals from the spontaneous nuclear fission of 238U within their lattices could be used for geological dating. They also demonstrated that a simple chemical etching procedure served to enlarge these fission tracks to optical dimensions so that they could be observed and measured under an ordinary optical microscope (Price and Walker 1962b, 1963). This simple procedure quickly opened the way for a wide range of nuclear particle track studies in natural minerals and glasses (e.g., Fleischer et al 1975), the most important of which was fission track dating. Fleischer et al. (1964) also showed that spontaneous, or fossil, fission tracks provided an explanation for various ‘anomalous' etch pits in apatite which had puzzled crystal- lographers over many years. The essence of a fission track age determination involves measuring the number of tracks that have accumulated over the lifetime of the mineral along with an estimate of the amount of uranium that is present. Knowing the rate of spontaneous fission decay, a geological age can be calculated. Detailed studies on apatite for routine geological dating applications began with the pioneering work of Naeser (1967) and Wagner (1968, 1969). These studies established basic procedures that enabled the rapid and widespread adoption of apatite for a variety of fission track dating applications. It was realized very early that fission tracks in minerals displayed only limited stability under exposure to elevated temperatures and that apatite was one of the most sensitive minerals to thermal annealing of fission tracks (Fleischer and Price 1964). Later studies have greatly refined our understanding of track annealing behavior in apatite providing a basis for many of the applications of the method which are discussed below. A comprehensive overview of the general field of fission track dating and its applications has been provided by Wagner and Van den Haute (1992), and a very useful review of methods and interpretive strategies by Gallagher et al. (1998). Here we will focus specifically on the fundamental mineralogical aspects fission of track dating, specifically as applied to apatite and other phosphate minerals, and emphasize the more recent applications and future directions for this field. 1529-6466/00/0048-0016{\{}{\$}{\}}05.00},

abstract = {Accelerated biotic turnover during the Late Triassic has led to the perception of an end-Triassic mass extinction event, now regarded as one of the "big five" extinctions. Close examination of the fossil record reveals that many groups thought to be affected severely by this event, such as ammonoids, bivalves and conodonts, instead were in decline throughout the Late Triassic, and that other groups were relatively unaffected or subject to only regional effects. Explanations for the biotic turnover have included both gradualistic and catastrophic mechanisms. Regression during the Rhaetian, with consequent habitat loss, is compatible with the disappearance of some marine faunal groups, but may be regional, not global in scale, and cannot explain apparent synchronous decline in the terrestrial realm. Gradual, widespread aridification of the Pangaean supercontinent could explain a decline in terrestrial diversity during the Late Triassic. Although evidence for an impact precisely at the boundary is lacking, the presence of impact structures with Late Triassic ages suggests the possibility of bolide impact-induced environmental degradation prior to the end-Triassic. Widespread eruptions of flood basalts of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) were synchronous with or slightly postdate the system boundary; emissions of CO2and SO2during these eruptions were substantial, but the contradictory evidence for the environmental effects of outgassing of these lavas remains to be resolved. A substantial excursion in the marine carbon-isotope record of both carbonate and organic matter suggests a significant disturbance of the global carbon cycle at the system boundary. Release of methane hydrates from seafloor sediments is a possible cause for this isotope excursion, although the triggering mechanism and climatic effects of such a release remain uncertain. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The nature of the early shells in the core genus Bellerophon demonstrates that the Amphigastropoda does not belong to the subclass Archaeogastropoda and that it forms a long-lived (Cambrian through Triassic), independent molluscan group. The very small size of the bilaterally symmetrical early shell of Bellerophon (Amphigastropoda) indicates the presence of a planktotrophic larval stage. The higher taxonomic position of the Cambro-Devonian Mimospirina, uniting the Paleozoic gastropods with sinistrally coiled shells bearing a large sinistrally coiled, non-archaeogastropod protoconch, is still open. The discovery of archaeogastropod-type protoconchs in Early Devonian gastropods indicates that the Archaeogastropoda have had the same early ontogenetic pattern for at least 400 Ma (Devonian to Recent) and represent a very old, independent gastropod group. The Early Ordovician-Late Permian members of the order Cyrtoneritimorpha (Neritimorpha) with their characteristic fish hook-like protoconch probably gave rise to the modern Cycloneritimorpha (Neritimorpha). The Euomphalomorpha with a cyrtoconic and planispiral openly coiled protoconch form an independent gastropod group, known only from the Paleozoic (Cambrian-Permian). The Early Ordovician-Early Devonian members of the order Perunelomorpha, with an open, trochospiral protoconch, evolved larvae which secreted their typical larval shell. The Perunelomorpha may represent an ancestral group of the Caenogastropoda and Heterostropha. The uncoiled protoconchs found in Cyrtoneritimorpha, Euomphalomorpha and Perunelomorpha represent a very old shell feature. The higher gastropods (Caenogastropoda, Heterostropha, and Neritimorpha), as well as the extinct Euomphalomorpha, may have evolved from a common ancestor with an uncoiled tubular shell, and thus, not directly from the Paleozoic Archaeogastropoda and/or Amphigastropoda.},

abstract = {1 . Although there has been a sustained effort to reconstruct the dynamics of the phosphorus cycle over the past 3.5 billion years 2–5 , it remains uncertain whether phosphorus limitation persisted throughout Earth's history and therefore whether the phosphorus cycle has consistently modulated biospheric productivity and ocean– atmosphere oxygen levels over time. Here we present a compilation of phosphorus abundances in marine sedimentary rocks spanning the past 3.5 billion years. We find evidence for relatively low authigenic phosphorus burial in shallow marine environments until about 800 to 700 million years ago. Our interpretation of the database leads us to propose that limited marginal phosphorus burial before that time was linked to phosphorus biolimitation, resulting in elemental stoichiometries in primary producers that diverged strongly from the Redfield ratio (the atomic ratio of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus found in phytoplankton). We place our phosphorus record in a quantitative biogeochemical model framework and find that a combination of enhanced phosphorus scavenging in anoxic, iron-rich oceans 6,7 and a nutrient-based bistability in atmospheric oxygen levels could have resulted in a stable low-oxygen world. The combination of these factors may explain the protracted oxygenation of Earth's surface over the last 3.5 billion years of Earth history 8 . However, our analysis also suggests that a fundamental shift in the phosphorus cycle may have occurred during the late Proterozoic eon (between 800 and 635 million years ago), coincident with a previously inferred shift in marine redox states 9 , severe perturbations to Earth's climate system 10 , and the emergence of animals 11,12 . Phosphorus (P) has only one stable isotope, making it impossible to track mass fluxes directly with traditional isotope mass balance approaches. Inverting for P budgets, therefore, relies heavily on the development of techniques for estimating ancient seawater phosphate concentrations and P burial fluxes 2 . With the goal of tracking the secular evolution of marginal marine P burial—the largest sink in the modern P cycle 13 —we present a compilation of new and published geochemical data from fine-grained siliciclastic sedimentary rocks (referred to here as 'shales'; see Supplementary Table 1). The marine shale record is a particularly useful archive for constraining element budgets within the oceans because this lithology is ubiqui-tous in the stratigraphic record and, taken in aggregate, records the large-scale sediment geochemistry of marine continental margin environments 14},

abstract = {Ecological traits of reefs across the Permian-Triassic boundary interval coincide with a modeled decline of atmospheric oxygen throughout the Permian Period. Selective extinction and recovery patterns within the reef system are observed both at the end of the middle Permian (end-Guadalupian) and at the Permian-Triassic boundary. The end-Guadalupian event selectively affected corals and broke down the cool-water carbonate factory. Sponges, however, were largely unaffected and bloomed in reefs toward the end of the Permian. The end-Permian total destruction of the metazoan reef system only left behind poorly diverse microbial communities. The temporal reef patterns are thus similar to spatial patterns of modern benthic communities approaching oxygen minimum zones. This observation suggests that a decline in oxygen concentrations was at least partly involved in the destruction of reefs, even where there is no direct evidence of oceanic anoxia.},

abstract = {Coeval records of ocean, atmosphere, and terrestrial change are crucial to understanding the pattern and causes of global mass extinction across the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). However, relationships among changes in different settings remain largely unclear, primarily due to the challenges associated with the correlation among disparate records. Here we compare marine carbon isotopic records with marine and terrestrial environmental and biotic events recorded in sediments from the Meishan PTB section of south China. Time-scaled carbonate carbon isotopes exhibit two gradual major shifts across the PTB at Meishan, and these are duplicable elsewhere around the Tethys Ocean. The two shifts are associated with two episodes of enhanced terrestrial weathering indicated by an increased abundance of 13C-enriched moretanes relative to hopanes and an elevated abundance of black carbon fragments. Key marine events previously reported for the PTB, including photic zone euxinia, faunal mass extinction, and cyanobacterial expansion, also occur as two episodes, coinciding with both of the progressive shifts to negative 13C values and enhanced weathering. The temporal sequence of the duplicable events suggests that the biotic crisis was a consequence of prolonged and episodic changes in the marine and continental systems, and argues against an extraterrestrial impact as the main cause. 2007 The Geological Society of America.},

abstract = {The end-Permian mass extinction represents the most severe biotic crisis for the last 540 million years, and the marine ecosystem recovery from this extinction was protracted, spanning the entirety of the Early Triassic and possibly longer. Numerous studies from the low-latitude Paleotethys and high-latitude Boreal oceans have examined the possible link between ocean chemistry changes and the end-Permian mass extinction. However, redox chemistry changes in the Panthalassic Ocean, comprising ∼85-90{\%} of the global ocean area, remain under debate. Here, we report multiple S-isotopic data of pyrite from Upper Permian-Lower Triassic deep-sea sediments of the Panthalassic Ocean, now present in outcrops of western Canada and Japan. We find a sulfur isotope signal of negative $\Delta$(33)S with either positive $\delta$(34)S or negative $\delta$(34)S that implies mixing of sulfide sulfur with different $\delta$(34)S before, during, and after the end-Permian mass extinction. The precise coincidence of the negative $\Delta$(33)S anomaly with the extinction horizon in western Canada suggests that shoaling of H2S-rich waters may have driven the end-Permian mass extinction. Our data also imply episodic euxinia and oscillations between sulfidic and oxic conditions during the earliest Triassic, providing evidence of a causal link between incursion of sulfidic waters and the delayed recovery of the marine ecosystem.},

abstract = {The Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary interval coincides with enhanced extinction rates in the marine realm and pronounced changes in terrestrial ecosystems on the continents. It is further marked by distinct negative excursions in the $\delta$13Corg and $\delta$13Ccarb signature that may represent strong perturbations of the global carbon cycle. We present integrated geochemical, stable-isotope and palynological data from the Kuhjoch section, the Global boundary Stratotype Section and Point (GSSP) for the base of the Jurassic (Northern Calcareous Alps, Austria). We show that the initial carbon isotope excursion (CIE), coinciding with the marine extinction interval and the formation of black shales in the western Tethys Eiberg Basin, is marked by only minor changes in kerogen type, which is mainly of terrestrial origin. Increased Total Organic Carbon (TOC) concentrations of 9{\%} at the first half of the initial CIE coincide with Hydrogen Index (HI) values of over 600 mg HC/g TOC. The high correlation (with R2 = 0.93) between HI values and terrestrial Cheirolepidiaceaen conifer pollen suggests a terrestrial source for the hydrogen enriched organic compounds. The lack of major changes in source of the sedimentary organic matter suggests that changes in the $\delta$13Corg composition are genuine and represent true disturbances of the global C-cycle. The sudden decrease in total inorganic carbon (TIC) concentrations likely represents the onset of a biocalcification crisis. It coincides with a 4.5‰ negative shift in $\delta$13Corg values and possibly corresponds to the onset of CAMP related volcanic activity. The second half of the initial CIE is marked by the dramatic increase of green algae remains in the sediment. The simultaneous increase of the Corg/Ntot ratio suggests increased marine primary production at the final stage of black shale formation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Santa Barbara Basin sediments host a complex network of abiotic and metabolic chemical reactions that knit together the carbon, sulfur, and iron cycles. From a 2.1-m sediment core collected in the center of the basin, we present high-resolution profiles of the concentrations and isotopic compositions of all the major species in this system: sulfate, sulfide (∑H2S), elemental sulfur (S0), pyrite, extractable organic sulfur (OS), proto-kerogen S, total organic and dissolved inorganic carbon, and total and reducible iron. Below 10 cm depth, the core is characterized by low apparent sulfate reduction rates ({\textless}0.01 mM/yr) except near the sulfate-methane transition zone. Surprisingly, pyrite forming in shallow sediments is ∼30‰ more 34S-depleted than coexisting ∑H2S in porewater. S0 has the same strongly 34S-depleted composition as pyrite where it forms near the sediment–water interface, though not at depth. This pattern is not easily explained by conventional hypotheses in which sedimentary pyrite derives from abiotic reactions with porewater ∑H2S or from the products of S0 disproportionation. Instead, we propose that pyrite formation in this environment occurs within sulfate reducing microbial aggregates or biofilms, where it reflects the isotopic composition of the immediate products of bacterial sulfate reduction. Porewater ∑H2S in Santa Barbara Basin may be more 34S-enriched than pyrite due to equilibration with relatively 34S-enriched OS. The difference between OS and pyrite $\delta$34S values would then reflect the balance between microbial sulfide formation and the abundance of exchangeable OS. Both OS and pyrite $\delta$34S records thus have the potential to provide valuable information about biogeochemical cycles and redox structure in sedimentary paleoenvironments.},

We analyzed {\~{}}100 samples over a 12-m-thick interval, generating palynological, paleobiological, and geochemical datasets to investigate the nature and causes of environmental changes. The section records at least two major volcanic episodes that culminated in deposition of approximately 25- to 35-cm-thick ash layers (bentonites) and that had profound effects on conditions in both the Dongpan marine environment and adjacent land areas. Intensification of eruptive activity during each volcanic cycle resulted in a shift toward conifer forests, increased wildfire intensity, and elevated subaerial weathering fluxes. The resulting increase in nutrient fluxes stimulated marine productivity in the short term but led to a negative feedback on productivity in the longer term as the OMZ of the Nanpanjiang Basin expanded, putting both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities under severe stress. Radiolarians exhibit large declines in diversity and abundance well before the global mass extinction horizon, demonstrating the diachroneity of the marine biotic crisis. The latest Permian crisis, which was probably triggered by the Siberian Traps flood basalts, intensified the destructive effects of the earlier local eruptions on terrestrial and marine ecosystems of the South China craton.},

abstract = {The Permo-Triassic crisis was a major turning point in geological history. Following the end-Guadalupian extinction phase, the Palaeozoic biota underwent a steady decline through the Lopingian (Late Permian), resulting in their decimation at the level that is adopted as the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB). This trend coincided with the greatest Phanerozoic regression. The extinction at the end of the Guadalupian and that marking the end of the Permian are therefore related. The subsequent recovery of the biota occupied the whole of the Early Triassic. Several phases of perturbations in ??13Ccarb occurred through a similar period, from the late Wuchiapingian to the end of the Early Triassic. Therefore, the Permian-Triassic crisis was protracted, and spanned Late Permian and Early Triassic time. The extinction associated with the PTB occurred in two episodes, the main act with a prelude and the epilogue. The prelude commenced prior to beds 25 and 26 at Meishan and coincided with the end-Permian regression. The main act itself happened in beds 25 and 26 at Meishan. The epilogue occurred in the late Griesbachian and coincided with the second volcanogenic layer (bed 28) at Meishan. The temporal distribution of these episodes constrains the interpretation of mechanisms responsible for the greatest Phanerozoic mass extinction, particularly the significance of a postulated bolide impact that to our view may have occurred about 50,000??Myr after the prelude. The prolonged and multi-phase nature of the Permo-Triassic crisis favours the mechanisms of the Earth's intrinsic evolution rather than extraterrestrial catastrophe. The most significant regression in the Phanerozoic, the palaeomagnetic disturbance of the Permo-Triassic Mixed Superchron, widespread extensive volcanism, and other events, may all be related, through deep-seated processes that occurred during the integration of Pangea. These combined processes could be responsible for the profound changes in marine, terrestrial and atmospheric environments that resulted in the end-Permian mass extinction. Bolide impact is possible but is neither an adequate nor a necessary explanation for these changes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Triassic-Jurassic boundary sections on the shore of Lake Williston, British Columbia record a spectrum of depositional environments from the western Canadian continental margin. A primarily deep-water, anoxic record of deposition, indicated by V/V + Ni, V/Cr, Th/U indices and pyrite framboid and facies data, is seen throughout the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic (Norian-Hettangian) interval in a section at Black Bear Ridge. Abundant Monotis bivalve populations in Norian strata are interpreted to have lived on the seabed during transient oxygenation events that punctuated the background anoxic conditions. Monotis went extinct around the Norian/Rhaetian boundary and the deep-water assemblages are subsequently dominated by thin-shelled pectinids. An intra-Rhaetian sea-level fall generated a major hiatus in the proximal Black Bear Ridge section whilst distinctive lowstand strata were developed in the more distal and more complete Ne Parle Pas Point and Pardonet Creek sections. These consist of shallow-water, phosphatic ooid sand facies that contain diverse bivalves. The majority of the infaunal bivalves (but not the epifaunal ones) disappeared at the acme of the regression. This is the end-Triassic mass extinction event and it occurred shortly before a terminal Triassic flooding event. This transgressive event is associated with a rapid negative shift of $\delta$13Corg values interpreted to be the Initial Isotope Excursion of Hesselbo et al.

The Rhaetian record of Williston Lake thus records an extinction of shallow-water infaunal bivalves during a lowstand prior to the development of a transgressive record that is associated with a major, negative C isotope. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Enrichment of alkylphenol entities occurs just below the main marine mass extinction horizon and prior to the characteristic end-Permian ??13C decline.

abstract = {An abrupt transition from oxic to anoxic-sulfidic (euxinic) marine bottom waters occurred in the Cariaco Basin in response to increasing productivity resulting from the late Pleistocene post-glacial rise in sea level and corresponding increase in surface-water nutrient availability. The microlaminated sediments of the euxinic interval, which span the last ???14.5 ky, suggest a predominance of water-column (syngenetic) pyrite formation based on (1) high pyrite sulfur (Spy) concentrations in the surficial sediment layers, (2) values for degree-of-pyritization (DOP) that generally do not increase appreciably with increasing burial, (3) ratios of total iron (FeT) to Al that are elevated above the continental baseline recorded in the underlying oxic sediments, and (4) Spy isotope trends that largely mimic the ??34SHS- of the modern water column. Intermediate DOP values in the microlaminated deposits and FeT/Al ratios that are slightly above continental levels indicate an iron reservoir controlled by scavenging during syngenetic pyrite formation in combination with intermediate rates of Fe-bearing siliciclastic accumulation. As predicted from the relative rates of siliciclastic delivery, FeT/Al and DOP data lie between end-member values observed in the modern Black Sea. As viewed broadly, FeT/Al and DOP relationships in euxinic sediments reflect the balance between syngenetic Fe scavenging and temporal and spatial gradients in siliciclastic input. Pyrite concentrations are generally low in the underlying oxic marine deposits because of limitations in the supply of organic carbon (Corg). However, the upper 80 cm of the Fe-rich, Corg-poor, bioturbated sediment show evidence for a strong diffusional HS- overprint from the overlying, Fe-limited euxinic marine environment. This post-glacial transition manifests in pyrite overprints that are strongly 34S-depleted relative to those in restricted, presently euxinic marine settings elsewhere in the world, such as the Black Sea, where the sedimentary sequence spanning the last glacial-interglacial transition begins with a shift from freshwater to Corg-poor oxic marine deposition and thus dominantly sulfate diffusion. Trends for Mo/Al ratios in the microlaminated sediments suggest that Mo is enriched by roughly two orders of magnitude above the continental levels recorded in the oxic deposits. Organic matter plays a role by enhancing HS- production and/or by providing a substrate for Mo scavenging. Significant Mo enrichment via diffusion into the upper portion of the bioturbated zone was not observed despite HS--rich pore waters as recorded in the heavy iron sulfide overprint. We have not, however, proven that high sulfide concentrations within the water column are required for enhanced Mo sequestration in sediments. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Conodont, C isotope and fossil and facies data are presented for the Capitanian (Middle Permian) mass extinction record seen in platform carbonates (Maokou and Wuchiaping formations) of South China, where limestones interdigitate with the volcanic succession of the Emeishan large igneous province. The Maokou Formation provides an extinction record marked by the loss of keriothecal-walled fusulinaceans and a turnover in calcareous algae. In sections within the Emeishan province this crisis occurs at the base of the oldest record of volcanism from the Jinogondolella altudaensis conodont zone (of mid-Capitanian age). Around the periphery of the Emeishan province this extinction level lies within the upper part of the Maokou Formation at a level where platform carbonate deposition was frequently interrupted by thick volcanic ash depositional events. The assemblages of the uppermost Maokou Formation are characterised by typical “Late Permian” taxa although these levels still lie within the Middle Permian (Guadalupian Series). “Disaster” taxa, such as Earlandia and Diplosphaerina are locally prolifically abundant in the aftermath of the mass extinction. The crisis is particularly noteworthy amongst photosynthetic taxa such as calcareous algae and fusulinaceans that probably harboured photosymbionts. Therefore, a kill mechanism involving cooling from explosive volcanism and potentially acid rain from sulphate aerosols appears appropriate. A composite $\delta$13Ccarb curve, calibrated against a high-resolution conodont biostratigraphy reveals a major intra-Capitanian negative excursion (of {\textgreater} 5‰) superimposed on typically heavy (4–5‰) Middle Permian values. This curve can also be recognised in Panthalassan seamount carbonates of Japan although this requires reassignment of apparently Upper Permian limestones to the Middle Permian. In both China and Japan the Capitanian mass extinction occurs during the early stage of this major, intra-Capitanian negative excursion. Assuming typical platform carbonate accumulation rates, the records of the Maokou Formation suggest $\delta$13Ccarb values fell at ∼ 0.01‰/kyr suggesting a catastrophic origin (such as gas hydrate destabilisation) is unlikely, although a volcanic source is possible.},

The formation of dead zones has been exacerbated by the increase in primary production and consequent worldwide coastal eutrophication fueled by riverine runoff of fertilizers and the burning of fossil fuels. Enhanced primary production results in an accumulation of particulate organic matter, which encourages microbial activity and the consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters. Dead zones have now been reported from more than 400 systems, affecting a total area of more than 245,000 square kilometers, and are probably a key stressor on marine ecosystems.},

This suggests reduced oxygen conditions, and the presence of H2S, is the cause of the end-Permian extinction. The Bulla section also shows three troughs in $\delta$34Ssulfate, of which the latter two coincide with the dysoxic–euxinic intervals. This suggests that the latter two $\delta$34Ssulfate troughs are the result of H2S oxidation in surface waters, but the first trough is the result of a different mechanism. We propose that H2S was oxidized in another region, either to low $\delta$34Ssulfate water or elemental S, which then moved to the Bulla area. At the Balvany section, Hungary, there are two $\delta$34Ssulfate troughs near the extinction and no evidence of euxinia. A similar mechanism to the first Bulla $\delta$34Ssulfate trough is proposed, with the suggestion that these waters were also depleted in oxygen in order to effect the extinction at Balvany.},

abstract = {C-, O- and Sr-isotopes have been analysed for three sections of the Cantabrian Zone (northern Spain) and the southern Montagne Noire (France) that cross the Lower-Middle Cambrian transition, or Bilbilian-Leonian transition in its Iberian sense. The base of the Leonian (Middle Cambrian) is regionally defined by the first appearance of the trilobite Acadoparadoxides mureroensis, which is well constrained in the Cantabrian Zone but absent in the Montagne Noire. In the Bilbilian parts of the three sections, nearshore to peritidal strata are capped by erosive unconformities. The succeeding Leonian relative sea-level rise is recorded in similar fashion in both environments, leading to the deposition of aggradational bioclastic limestones and/or transgressive limestone/shale couplets (the so-called griotte facies) overlain by offshore shales, which relate to platform drowning and coastal smothering during the Leonian-Caesaraugustan transition. Bilbilian-Leonian carbonates show a long-term trend to higher $\delta$13C values that was punctuated by a succession of positive excursions. In Cr{\'{e}}menes-Valdor{\'{e}} (Cantabrian Zone) and Ferrals-les-Montagnes (Montagne Noire), two Bilbilian $\delta$13C shifts (an older uncertain peak at + 0.1‰/+ 0.01‰ and a younger certain shift at + 0.6‰/+ 1.7‰), and two Leonian shifts (peaking at + 1.1‰/+ 1.2‰ and + 1.3‰, respectively) are apparent; at Genestosa (Cantabrian Zone) a fifth early-middle Caesaraugustan shift is identified (peaking at + 2.1‰). These positive excursions and increasing trend are similar to published trends from the Lower-Middle Cambrian transition in Siberia and Australia, although in those areas only two $\delta$13C excursions have been reported so far. The marked negative $\delta$13C excursion reported from the Lower-Middle Cambrian boundary of Laurentia and China is not recorded in our dataset. Oxygen isotope and trace element (Ca, Mn and Sr) data indicate that our $\delta$13C trends are unlikely to be diagenetic features, while the lack of correlation with relative sea-level fluctuations, facies changes, or benthic community dynamics means that they could be of potential for global stratigraphic correlation. Sr isotope compositions for the Cantabrian Zone succession exhibit consistent values upsection, which suggests that seawater87Sr/86Sr remained around 0.7089-0.7090. Our more limited dataset for the Montagne Noire region confirms this value, and both are consistent with published constraints from Laurentia for seawater87Sr/86Sr across the Lower-Middle Cambrian boundary. The only other87Sr/86Sr study to cover the boundary interval reported significantly lower87Sr/86Sr values ∼0.7087-0.7088, indicating perhaps that the Lower-Middle Cambrian boundary in Siberia lies stratigraphically below its equivalent levels in Europe and Laurentia. However, we consider it more likely that these Siberian samples have been diagenetically altered to less radiogenic values. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The latest Permian was a time of major change in ocean chemistry, accompanying the greatest mass extinction of the Phanerozoic. To examine the nature of these changes, samples from two well-studied marine sections that span the Permian-Triassic boundary have been analyzed: the Meishan and Shangsi sections located in Southern China. Isotopic analysis of the carbonate-associated sulfate in these samples provides a detailed record of several isotopic shifts in delta34SCAS approaching and across the PTB, ranging from +30 to -15per mille sign (VCDT), with repeated asynchronous fluctuations at the two locations. We interpret the patterns of isotopic shifts, in conjunction with other data, to indicate a shallow unstable chemocline overlying euxinic deep-water which periodically upwelled into the photic zone. These chemocline upward excursion events introduced sulfide to the photic zone stimulating a bloom of phototrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria. We hypothesize that elemental sulfur globules produced by these organisms and 34S-depleted pyrite produced in the euxinic water column were deposited in the sediment; later oxidation led to incorporation as CAS. This created the large changes to the delta34SCAS observed in the latest Permian at these locations.},

abstract = {Temnospondyls are a group of basal tetrapods that existed from the Early Carboniferous to the Early Cretaceous. They were characteristic members of Permian and Triassic continental faunas around the globe. Only one clade, the Brachyopoidea (Brachyopidae and Chigutisauridae), is found as relics in the Jurassic of eastern Asia and the Cretaceous of Australia. The other Late Triassic clades, such as Plagiosauridae, Metoposauridae, and Cyclotsauridae, are generally believed to have gone extinct gradually before the end of the Triassic and putative Rhaetian records are stratigraphically poorly constrained. Temnospondyl humeri all show a similar morphological pattern, being stout, short, with widened ends, and with a typical torsion between the proximal and distal heads. Based on these characters, a humerus found in a Rhaetic-type bonebed in unequivocally Rhaetian sediments (marine Exter Formation) in a clay pit at Bonenburg (eastern Westphalia, Germany) was identified as pertaining to the temnospondyl cf. Cyclotosaurus sp. The humeral midshaft histology also supports temnospondyl affinities and serves to exclude plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs from consideration. This find is the geologically youngest record of a non-brachyopoid temnospondyl, indicating that cyclotosaurids survived well into the Rhaetian, likely falling victim to the end-Triassic extinction.},

Thus, these oil samples represent a wide range of source paleoenvironments from thirteen age divisions (Riphean to Neogene). The stable carbon isotopic compositions of both fractions become enriched in 13C with decreasing geologic age. Three major, abrupt shifts toward 13C enrichment occurred at the Precambrian-Cambrian/Ordovician, Triassic/Jurassic and Paleogene/neogene boundaries. Analysis of smaller scale isotopic shifts reveals four distinct groups of oils, generally independent of organic facies and secondary alteration processes. Comparison of evolutionary changes in the biosphere to episodic changes in stable carbon isotopic compositions throughout the Phanerozoic indicates that isotopic shifts of crude oils may generally be related to the diversity of preserved phytoplankton.},

Steady-state and non-steady-state models suggest that these fundamental changes are best explained by a combination of evolving burial fluxes and a secular decrease in the size of the marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) reservoir. The DIC reservoir size affects the sensitivity of the isotopic system to biogeochemical perturbation. Major rearrangements of carbon cycling during the Proterozoic, in part related to the evolving marine carbon reservoir, permit elevated 13 C values to be sustained for geologically long time spans. Recognition of this dependence on DIC reservoir size provides, for the first time, a direct link between changing carbonate precipitation styles and the marine C isotope record and may help constrain estimates of Proterozoic pCO 2 .},

To date, the marine distributions of these elements have been understood primarily in terms of biological assimilation by growing phytoplankton and regeneration of sinking biological material. Initial studies of Zn and Cd concentrations and stable isotope ratios (??66Zn and ??114Cd) have therefore focused on their use as simple tracers of assimilation and regeneration in the oceans. However, these two processes are insufficient to explain new data on the marine distribution of Zn and ??66Zn. Here, using the first high-resolution paired marine depth profiles of Zn, Cd, ??66Zn and ??114Cd, we suggest that scavenging of Zn onto organic matter plays a major, yet largely unconsidered, role in the marine cycling of Zn. This hypothesis is supported by culture experiments, which show that Zn released from degrading phytoplankton is rapidly scavenged back onto organic matter, and that adsorbed Zn is isotopically heavier than the dissolved phase by 0.58???. In contrast, very little Cd or phosphate was scavenged and Cd isotopes were not significantly fractionated during degradation. Our hypothesis is further supported by one-dimensional modeling, which reproduces observed marine ??66Zn profiles with {\textless}1{\%} of Zn adsorbed to particles. Understanding how Zn cycling in the oceans is a balance between assimilation, scavenging, and regeneration is necessary in order to investigate ??66Zn as a tracer of marine productivity. We anticipate that paired analyses of ??66Zn and ??114Cd will prove to be valuable new tools in constraining patterns of global primary productivity, providing key information for the marine carbon cycle during periods of past and present global climate change. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in mammalian tooth enamel are commonly used to understand the diets and environments of modern and fossil animals. Isotope variation during the period of enamel formation can be recovered by intra-tooth microsampling along the direction of growth. However, conventional sampling of the enamel surface provides highly time-averaged records in part due to amelogenesis. We use backscattered electron imaging in the scanning electron microscope (BSE-SEM) to evaluate enamel mineralization in developing teeth from one rodent and two ungulates. Gray levels from BSE-SEM images suggest that the innermost enamel layer, {\textless}20$\mu$m from the enamel-dentine junction, is highly mineralized early in enamel maturation and therefore may record a less attenuated isotopic signal than other layers. We sampled the right maxillary incisor from a woodrat subjected to an experimentally induced water-switch during the period of tooth development, and demonstrate that secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) can be used to obtain $\delta$18O values with 4-5-$\mu$m spots from mammalian tooth enamel. We also demonstrate that SIMS can be used to discretely sample the innermost enamel layer, which is too narrow for conventional microdrilling or laser ablation. An abrupt $\delta$18O switch of 16.0{\%} was captured in breath CO2, a proxy for body water, while a laser ablation enamel surface intra-tooth profile of the left incisor captured a $\delta$18O range of 12.1{\%}. The innermost enamel profile captured a $\delta$18O range of 15.7{\%}, which approaches the full magnitude of $\delta$18O variation in the input signal. This approach will likely be most beneficial in taxa such as large mammalian herbivores, whose teeth are characterized by less rapid mineralization and therefore greater attenuation of the enamel isotope signal. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

@misc{Adams2010a,
abstract = {During the Cretaceous period ({\~{}}145–65 million years ago), there were several periods of global ocean anoxia, each lasting less than one million years. These events, known as ocean anoxic events, were marked by significant increases in organic carbon burial, and are generally attributed to increased primary productivity in surface waters. The details underpinning the initiation, maintenance and termination of these events, however, remain equivocal. Here we present sulphur isotope data spanning the Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (about 94.5 million years ago) from sedimentary rocks in Colorado that were formed in the Western Interior Seaway; this seaway ran north–south, splitting North America during the Cretaceous. Sulphate levels increased rapidly from relatively low background levels at the onset of the event, most likely from the release of sulphur by massive volcanism, and fell during the anoxic event. We infer that the input of sulphate facilitated increased carbon remineralization, which enhanced nutrient recycling and increased global primary productivity, eventually resulting in widespread ocean anoxia. Our scenario indicates that Ocean Anoxic Event 2 may have persisted until sulphate levels were stabilized by the formation and burial of the sulphur mineral pyrite, which returned primary productivity to background levels. We suggest that fluctuations in sulphate levels may have regulated the marine carbon cycle during past periods of low oceanic sulphate concentration.},

abstract = { The investigation of the trace element and organic geochemistry of the Frasnian-Famennian boundary section at Kowala (Holy Cross Mountains/Poland) shows that the lower water column was oxygen-deficient during late Frasnian and early Famennian times. The abundance and carbon isotopic composition of diaryl isoprenoids, biomarkers indicative for green sulfur bacteria, prove that euxinic waters reached into the photic zone, at least episodically. Total organic carbon (TOC) contents show two maxima that are time-equivalent to the Kellwasser horizons deposited in shallower water settings. Enhanced TOC concentrations are explained by a higher primary productivity, presumably as a consequence of an enhanced nutrient supply from the continent. The increase in the abundance of hopanes and bituminite suggests that the bacterial contribution to TOC increased at the Frasnian-Famennian transition. The sulfur isotopic composition of pyritic- and organically bound sulfur shows a +27 per mil excursion across the boundary. The observation that the delta (super 34) S values of organic-bound sulfur closely resemble that of pyrite sulfur indicates a common sulfur source, likely early diagenetic sulfide. A change in the delta (super 13) C of total dissolved inorganic carbon as a consequence of an enhanced burial of (super 12) C-enriched organic carbon is indicated by a +3 per mil excursion measured for TOC as well as for individual n-alkanes and isoprenoids. The burial of large amounts of organic carbon is expected to result in a decrease in pCO (sub 2) and should affect the photosynthetic carbon isotope fractionation (epsilon (sub p) ). The fact that we observe no change in epsilon (sub p) can be explained by the circumstance that epsilon (sub p) was most probably at maximum values, as a consequence of high atmospheric and oceanic-dissolved CO (sub 2) concentrations during the Devonian.},

abstract = {Large carbon isotope fluctuations have been systematically reported for Ediacaran carbonate rocks, the meaning of which remains controversial. In order to better understand the mechanisms behind such variations, we present new paired $\delta$13C data on carbonates ($\delta$13Ccarb) and their associated organic matter ($\delta$13Corg) from a shelf-margin section (Yangjiaping) of the Doushantuo Formation. In this section, the Doushantuo Formation starts with cap dolostones presenting $\delta$13Ccarbvalues around - 5‰ and $\delta$13Corgvalues between - 30.3 and - 27.6‰. Up-section, phased variations in $\delta$13Ccarband $\delta$13Corgdescribe positive and negative excursions, while their difference ($\Delta$13Cdol-org= $\delta$13Ccarb- $\delta$13Corg) remains around + 29.2‰. These new data allow the first reconstruction of lateral variations of $\delta$13Ccarb, $\delta$13Corgand $\Delta$13Ccarb-orgfor a shelf-to-basin cross-section of the Yangtze platform (South China) after integration with results reported previously for two other sections. Across the Yangtze platform, the isotope signals reveal strong lateral heterogeneities, with complex variations of $\delta$13Ccarband $\Delta$13Cdol-orgin the inner-shelf section, phased variations in the shelf-margin section with positive $\delta$13Ccarband $\Delta$13Cdol-orgclose to 29‰, and dominantly negative $\delta$13Ccarbwith $\delta$13Corgas low as - 35‰ in the basin. These variations are incompatible with the idea that the $\delta$13Ccarbcan systematically be used as a proxy of ocean surface waters. Assuming that $\delta$13Ccarbare acquired in bottom waters and/or upper sediments, we show that the heterogeneous $\delta$13Ccarband $\Delta$13Cdol-orgare compatible with a stratified water column composed of up to three layers: (i) an oxic surface layer, where dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) is probably in isotope equilibrium with the atmosphere; (ii) an intermediate euxinic layer with a lower $\delta$13CDICdue to organic matter oxidation by ongoing sulphate reduction; (iii) a bottom euxinic layer that seems to be restricted to the inner-shelf lagoonal facies, lacking sulphate, containing methane and with a higher $\delta$13CDICdue to DIC production by methanogenesis. If our model holds true, it suggests that not only negative but also positive Ediacaran carbon isotope excursions may reflect ocean stratification, the positive excursion possibly recording a sulphate-free methanogenic layer at the bottom of restricted basins. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although the Cretaceous is generally considered as a greenhouse period in Earth's history, a number of significant cooling events based on an array of climatic proxies have been identified. Here we present the first data on Berriasian (Ryazanian) glendonite findings from the paleontologically well dated Lower Cretaceous succession of northeastern Siberia. Based on well calibrated Buchia and ammonite biostratigraphy, the stratigraphic interval across which the glendonites occur is restricted to the late Berriasian. Stable carbon isotope ($\delta$13C) values of the studied glendonites clearly suggest the precipitation of ikaite from marine water without any significant contamination from biogenic methane. Our results, when integrated with other available paleoclimatic proxies from elsewhere in the high latitudes, suggest a revision of the initiation of Early Cretaceous cooling in the high latitudes from the Valanginian to the late Berriasian. All known occurrences of Lower Cretaceous glendonites in both the northern and southern hemispheres are reviewed.},

Although distribution, morphology and ultrastructure of the spores indicate that they are derived from terrestrial plants, possibly early relatives of the bryophytes, this interpretation remains controversial as there is little in the way of direct evidence for the parent plants. An additional complicating factor is that there is a significant hiatus between the appearance of the first dispersed spores and fossils of relatively complete land plants (megafossils): spores predate the earliest megafossils (Late Silurian, 425 million year ago) by some 50 million years. Here we report the description of spore-containing plant fragments from Ordovician rocks of Oman. These fossils provide direct evidence for the nature of the spore-producing plants. They confirm that the earliest spores developed in large numbers within sporangia, providing strong evidence that they are the fossilized remains of bona fide land plants.

This isotopic composition is consistent with remobilization of biogenic barite triggered by sulfate reduction, and subsequent reprecipitation as a diagenetic barite front. The high levels of barium sulfate in these deposits (10-50{\%}) cannot be explained by a diffusive transport model in sediments experiencing a constant rate of sedimentation. When sedimentation rates change radically, the barite front will remain at a given depth interval leading to large accumulations of barium sulfate. Such conditions may have generated the barite deposits at Site 799. At Site 684, on the other hand, there is evidence that the barite deposits are a result of the tectonically-driven advection of sulfate-bearing fluids through the sediment column.},

Global resolution ≤. 100. kyr is commonly available when evaluating events from the Cenozoic Era, but such resolution is less common for older portions of Earth history. The introduction of High-Resolution Event Stratigraphy (HiRES) more than two decades ago revolutionized the ability to resolve the Mesozoic and Cenozoic stratigraphic records of global change, and a similar revolution is currently underway for the Paleozoic as well. Here, we review the application of the principles of HiRES to the Paleozoic stratigraphic record with examples from the Silurian System, discuss the quantification of chronostratigraphic uncertainty, and highlight the current deep-time Earth history revolution that has the potential to open the entire Phanerozoic record to the evaluation of short time scale global climate dynamics.},

abstract = {The Permian/Triassic (P/Tr) boundary beds of the Meishan section, South China, have been re-studied in detail based on complete samples across the P/Tr transition. Under the microscope, the end-Permian mass extinction horizon is calibrated to a 12-mm stratal interval, the top being 19 mm below the top of Bed 24e of the Changhsing Formation. This abrupt disappearance of skeletal fragments of major benthos characterizes the end-Permian extinction event, suggesting a catastrophic event. An abrupt decrease in the 34S/32S ratios of seawater sulfate is confirmed to coincide with the end-Permian event horizon. The sulfur isotope event is thought to have been caused by an overturn of a stratified ocean dominated by H2S, implying coincidence of the oceanic mixing and the mass extinction. Coincident Siberian flood volcanism may have triggered a long-term ({\textgreater} 103 years) cooling leading an ocean mixing. A presumed comet impact to the ocean could have directly caused ocean mixing and the mass extinction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Assemblages of acritarchs, prasinophytes, and miospores were recovered from the uppermost Iquiri and lower portion of the Itacua formations in southeast Bolivia. Analysis of the diverse and somewhat abundant well-preserved palynomorph assemblage indicates a Late Devonian (late Famennian) age for both formations, and further subdivision in ascending stratigraphic order into the ?VCo, LL, LE, and LN miospore biozones of Western Europe. The presence of age-diagnostic miospore taxa from South America and North America indicates contemporaneous glaciation events between these two regions. The results from close sampling of the diamictite facies of the Itacua Formation at the Bermejo West section, Bolivia, correlate the latest Famennian spore inceptions used to define the Euramerica miospore biozone sequence (LL, LE, and LN zones). The Itacua Formation diamictite sequence examined is relatively thin compared to other diamictite sequences in Bolivia. Furthermore, the miospore biozones represent an estimated duration of three million years, whereas orbitally-forced glacial-interglacial events (e.g., Ruddiman, 2001) are of the Milankovitch frequency range of between 20,000 and 400,000. years. Therefore, it seems most likely that a number of glacial/interglacial events are represented, rather than a single glacial episode. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Throughout most of the Phanerozoic, reef rigidity resulted as much, or more, from early lithification by microbial carbonates and biologically induced cements (non-enzymatic carbonates) than from biological encrustation of, or by, large, enzymatically secreted metazoan skeletons. Reef framework is divided into four categories: (1) skeletal metazoan; (2) non-skeletal microbialite (stromatolite and thrombolite); (3) calcimicrobe; and (4) biocementstone, in which small or delicate organisms serve as scaffolds for rigid cement crusts. The last three categories are dominated by non-enzymatic carbonates. Skeletal framework and non-skeletal microbialite framework were the most abundant framework types through the Phanerozoic. The composition and abundance of skeletal framework was controlled largely by mass extinction events, but most reefs consisted of both microbialite and skeletal organisms in a mutually beneficial relationship. Microbialite framework was abundant throughout the Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic, but declined after the Jurassic. Calcimicrobe framework was important during the Cambrian-Early Ordovician and Devonian and biocementstone framework was important from the late Mississippian to the Late Triassic.The Phanerozoic history of reefs does not correlate well with the stratigraphic distribution of large, skeletal 'reef builders', or with a variety of physicochemical parameters, including sea-level history, Wilson Cycle or global climate cycles. Because non-enzymatic carbonates result from induction by non-obligate calcifiers, and not enzymatic precipitation by obligate calcifiers, the distribution of these carbonates was controlled to a larger extent by temporal changes in physicochemical parameters affecting the saturation state of sea water with respect to carbonate minerals. Changes in pCO(2), Ca/Mg ratios, cation concentrations and temperature may have affected the abundance of non-enzymatic carbonates and, hence, reefs, independently from the effects of these same parameters and mass extinction events on skeletal reef biota. The decline in abundance of reefal microbialite and absence of calcimicrobe and biocementstone reef framework after the Jurassic may be a result of relatively low saturation states of sea water owing to increased removal and sequestration of finite marine carbonate resources by calcareous plankton since the Jurassic. Reef history is difficult to correlate with temporal changes in specific global parameters because these parameters affect skeletal biota and biologically induced carbonate precipitation independently. Hence, reef history was regulated not just by skeletal reef biota, but by parameters governing non-enzymatic carbonates.},

abstract = {As illustrated by the broad range of topics presented in this volume, the mineral apatite, Ca5(PO4)3(F,OH,Cl), is of importance in a greater variety of fields than virtually any other mineral. It is of particular significance in Earth science, life science, and material science; the foundation of this significance is the apatite atomic arrangement.  Apatite is the most abundant naturally occurring phosphate on Earth. Consequently, it is the major source of phosphorous, both as an ore and the base of the global phosphorous cycle. As the major ore mineral of phosphorous, apatite is critical for the production of huge quantities of fertilizers, detergents and phosphoric acid; the extracted phosphorous is also used in many other applications such as phosphors, rust removers, motor fuels, and insecticides to name but a few (McConnell 1973). The global biogeochemical cycling of phosphorous starts by its release from apatite at the Earth's surface and ultimately leads to the formation of other geological apatites through sedimentary processes or tectonic recycling. Along the way, however, it is an essential element to all life on Earth (Filippelli, this volume).  The structure and chemistry of apatite allow for numerous substitutions, including a multitude of metal cations (i.e., K, Na, Mn, Ni, Cu, Co, Zn, Sr, Ba, Pb, Cd, Sb, Y, REEs, U) that substitute for Ca in the structure, and anionic complexes (i.e., AsO43−, SO42−, CO32−, SiO44−, etc.) that replace PO43− (Pan and Fleet, this volume). Indeed, apatite incorporates half the periodic chart in its atomic arrangement. These substitutions are usually in trace concentrations, but large concentrations and even complete solid solutions exist for certain substituents. This complex and variable chemistry has great implications, and is utilized in all areas ...},

abstract = {Many aspects of deep-time Earth System models, including mantle convection, paleoclimatology, paleobiogeography and the deep Earth carbon cycle, require high-resolution plate motion models that include the evolution of the mosaic of plate boundaries through time. We present the first continuous late Paleozoic to present-day global plate model with evolving plate boundaries, building on and extending two previously published models for the late Paleozoic (410–250 Ma) and Mesozoic-Cenozoic (230–0 Ma). We ensure continuity during the 250–230 Ma transition period between the two models, update the absolute reference frame of the Mesozoic-Cenozoic model and add a new Paleozoic reconstruction for the Baltica-derived Alexander Terrane, now accreted to western North America. This 410–0 Ma open access model provides a framework for deep-time whole Earth modelling and acts as a base for future extensions and refinement. We analyse the model in terms of the number of plates, predicted plate size distribution, plate and continental root mean square (RMS) speeds, plate velocities and trench migration through time. Overall model trends share many similarities to those for recent times, which we use as a first order benchmark against which to compare the model and identify targets for future model refinement. Except for during the period {\~{}} 260–160 Ma, the number of plates (16–46) and ratio of “large” plates (≥ 107.5km2) to smaller plates ({\~{}} 2.7–6.6) are fairly similar to present-day values (46 and 6.6, respectively), with lower values occurring during late Paleozoic assembly and growth of Pangea. This temporal pattern may also reflect difficulties in reconstructing small, now subducted oceanic plates further back in time, as well as whether a supercontinent is assembling or breaking up. During the {\~{}} 260–160 Ma timeframe the model reaches a minima in the number of plates, in contrast to what we would expect during initial Pangea breakup and thus highlighting the need for refinement of the relative plate motion model. Continental and plate RMS speeds show an overall increase backwards through time from {\~{}} 200 to 365 Ma, reaching a peak at 365 Ma of {\textgreater} 14 and {\textgreater} 16 cm/yr, respectively, compared to {\~{}} 3 and {\~{}} 5 cm/yr, respectively, at present-day. The median value of trench motion remains close to, yet above 0 cm/yr for most of the model timeframe, with a dominance in positive values reflecting a prevalence of trench retreat over advance. Trench advance speeds are excessive during the 370–160 Ma period, reaching more than four times that observed at present-day. Extended periods of trench advance and global continental and plate RMS speeds that far exceed present-day values warrant further investigation. Future work should test whether alternative absolute reference frames or relative motions would mitigate these high speeds, while still being consistent with geologic and geophysical observations, or alternatively focus on identifying potential driving mechanisms to account for such rapid motions.},

@article{Eyles2004,
abstract = {The 'Snowball Earth' model of Hoffman et al. [Science 281 (1998) 1342] has stimulated renewed interest in the causes of glaciation in Earth history and the sedimentary, stratigraphic and geochemical response. The model invokes catastrophic global Neoproterozoic refrigerations when oceans froze, ice sheets covered the tropics and global temperatures plummeted to -50 °C. Each event is argued to be recorded by tillites and have lasted up to 10 million years. Planetary biological activity was arrested only to resume in the aftermath of abrupt and brutal volcanically generated 'greenhouse' deglaciations when global temperatures reached +50 °C. The 'Cambrian explosion' is regarded by some as a consequence of post-Snowball glacioeustatic flooding of continental shelves. We shall show by a systematic review of the model that it is based on many long standing assumptions of the character and origin of the Neoproterozoic glacial record, in particular, 'tillites', that are no longer valid. This paper focusses on the sedimentological and stratigraphic evidence for glaciation in the light of current knowledge of glacial depositional systems. By integrating this analysis with recent understanding of the tectonic setting of Neoproterozoic sedimentary basins, an alternative 'Zipper-rift' hypothesis for Neoproterozoic glaciations is developed. The 'Zipper-rift' model emphasises the strong linkage between the first-order reorganisation of the Earth's surface created by diachronous rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia, the climatic effects of uplifted rift flanks and the resulting sedimentary record deposited in newly formed rift basins. Initial fragmentation of Rodinia commenced after about 750 Ma (when the paleo-Pacific Ocean started to form along the western margin of Laurentia) and culminated sometime after 610 Ma (with the opening of the paleo-Atlantic Ocean on the eastern margin of Laurentia). Breakup is recorded by well-defined 'tectonostratigraphic' successions that were deposited in marine rift basins. The base of each succession is characterised by coarse-grained synrift strata consisting of mass flow diamictites and conglomerates (many of the 'tillites' of the older literature). These facies are interbedded with large olistostromes and contain clastic carbonate debris derived from landsliding of fault scarps along rifted carbonate platforms. Diamictites and conglomerates are dominantly the product of subaqueous mass flow and mixing of coarse and fine sediment populations (the term mixtite has been used in the past). These facies are not uniquely glacial and are produced regardless of climate and latitude. Synrift deposits commonly pass up into thick slope turbidites recording enhanced subsidence and are capped by uppermost shallow marine strata that record a reduction in subsidence rates and overall basin shallowing. Tectonostratigraphic 'cycles' can attain thicknesses of several kilometres, but have been commonly misinterpreted as recording globally synchronous 'glacioeustatic', falls and rises in sea level. In fact, eustatic sea-level changes in rift basins are suppressed as a result of a strong tectonic control on relative water depths. The great length of newly formed rifted margins around the long perimeter of Laurentia ({\textless}20,000 km) ensured that deposition of tectonostratigraphic successions occurred diachronously as in the manner of a zipper between approximately 740 and 610 Ma. Some successions show a definite glacial influence on sedimentation as a consequence of latitude or strong tectonic uplift, but many do not. Regardless, all deposits record a fully functioning hydrological cycle entirely at odds with a supposed fully permafrozen planet. Mapping of those deposits where a definite glacial imprint is apparent indicates that Neoproterozoic glaciation(s) were likely regional or hemispheric in scope and latitudinally constrained. They were perhaps no more severe than other glaciations recorded in Earth history. The regional distribution of ice centres is argued to have been influenced by tectonic topography created by large mantle plumes and by rift shoulder uplift. Paleomagnetic data indicative of tropical glaciation are, in our view, ambiguous because of uncertainty as to when such paleomagnetic characteristics were acquired. A lower solar luminosity may have played a role in lowering snow line elevations and displacing glaciation into latitudes lower than those of Phanerozoic glaciations. Global tectonic and volcanic activity, especially the rapid burial or organic carbon in new rift basins, may explain extreme shifts in C-isotopic values evident in late Neoproterozoic strata. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding the changes in, and drivers of, isotopic variability of sulfur in seawater sulfate ($\delta$34SSO4-sw) over geological time remains a long-standing goal, particularly because of the coupling between the biogeochemical sulfur and carbon cycles. The early Cenozoic has remained enigmatic in this regard, as the existing seawater sulfate isotopic records appear to be decoupled from the well-defined carbon isotope composition of the ocean. Here, we present a new Cenozoic record of sulfur isotopes, using carbonate-associated sulfate hosted in the calcite lattice of single-species foraminifera. The vastly improved stratigraphy afforded by this record demonstrates that carbon and sulfur cycles, as recorded by their isotopes, are not fully decoupled in the early Cenozoic. With a model driven by partial coupling of the carbon and sulfur cycles, we demonstrate that a change in sulfur isotopic fractionation of the pyrite burial flux best explains the large increase in $\delta$34SSO4-sw {\~{}}53 million years ago (Ma) and the subsequent long steady state. We suggest that the locus of pyrite burial changed from shallow epicontinental seas and shelf environments to more open-ocean sediments around 53 Ma. Loss of extensive shelf environments corresponds to Cretaceous–Palaeogene sea-level changes and tectonic reorganization, occurring as the Himalayan arc first collided with Asia.},

abstract = {Throughout the Phanerozoic, the primary inorganic marine calcium carbonate mineralogy oscillated between calcite and aragonite, reflecting changes in seawater chemistry. These variations in seawater composition also appear to have influenced the evolution of calcifying organisms. However, the processes controlling these mineralogical and biological changes are poorly constrained. Previous work has focused mainly on the Mg/Ca ratio in seawater as the primary driver. Here, we examine the role of dissolved SO4 in these processes by performing controlled laboratory precipitation experiments and geochemical modeling of evaporite formation. We show that an increase in dissolved SO4 decreases the Mg/Ca ratio at which calcite is destabilized and aragonite becomes the dominant CaCO3 polymorph. Our data suggest that the Mg/Ca and SO4 thresholds for formation of calcite seas are significantly lower than previous estimates and are mutually dependent. This shows that our understanding of Phanerozoic changes in seawater chemistry and the models relating this to primary CaCO3 mineralogy need reevaluation.},

abstract = {New Late Ordovician and Triassic palaeomagnetic data from Iran are presented. These data, in conjunction with data from the literature, provide insights on the drift history of Iran as part of Cimmeria during the Ordovician–Triassic. A robust agreement of palaeomagnetic poles of Iran and West Gondwana is observed for the Late Ordovician–earliest Carboniferous, indicating that Iran was part of Gondwana during that time. Data for the Late Permian–early Early Triassic indicate that Iran resided on subequatorial palaeolatitudes, clearly disengaged from the parental Gondwanan margin in the southern hemisphere. Since the late Early Triassic, Iran has been located in the northern hemisphere close to the Eurasian margin. This northward drift brought Iran to cover much of the Palaeotethys in approximately 35 Ma, at an average plate speed of c. 7–8 cm year−1, and was in part coeval to the transformation of Pangaea from an Irvingian B to a Wegenerian A-type configuration.},

abstract = {The fossil record of modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) provides no evidence for major extinction or radiation episodes throughout most of the Mesozoic and early Tertiary. However, long-term gradual diversification is difficult to reconcile with the sensitivity of present-day amphibian faunas to rapid ecological changes and the incidence of similar environmental perturbations in the past that have been associated with high turnover rates in other land vertebrates. To provide a comprehensive overview of the history of amphibian diversification, we constructed a phylogenetic timetree based on a multigene data set of 3.75 kb for 171 species. Our analyses reveal several episodes of accelerated amphibian diversification, which do not fit models of gradual lineage accumulation. Global turning points in the phylogenetic and ecological diversification occurred after the end-Permian mass extinction and in the late Cretaceous. Fluctuations in amphibian diversification show strong temporal correlation with turnover rates in amniotes and the rise of angiosperm-dominated forests. Approximately 86{\%} of modern frog species and {\textgreater}81{\%} of salamander species descended from only five ancestral lineages that produced major radiations in the late Cretaceous and early Tertiary. This proportionally late accumulation of extant lineage diversity contrasts with the long evolutionary history of amphibians but is in line with the Tertiary increase in fossil abundance toward the present.},

abstract = {The 3.43 billion-year-old Strelley Pool Chert, Pilbara Craton, Western Australia, contains compelling evidence of Early Archaean life in the form of kilometre-sized remnants of an ancient stromatolitic carbonate platform. Reviewing and building on earlier studies, we examine the fossilized remains of the platform to seek ecosystem-scale insights to Earth's early biosphere, examining the evidence for biosedimentation, and the importance and effect of different environmental processes on biological activity. Both vertical and lateral trends show that stromatolite abundance and diversity are greatest in the area interpreted as an isolated, partially restricted, peritidal marine carbonate platform, or reef, where there is virtually no trace of hydrothermal or terrigenous clastic input. In contrast, stromatolites are poorly developed or absent among hydrothermal, volcaniclastic or terrigenous clastic sedimentary facies, and are absent in deeper marine settings that are laterally equivalent to shallow marine stromatolitic facies. Hydrothermal veins, some of which were previously interpreted as vents that exhaled fluids from which the stromatolitic structures precipitated, are shown to postdate the stromatolites. On the platform, stromatolite facies associations varied between different palaeoenvironments, but some stromatolite types occurred across different palaeoenvironments, highlighting the combined influence of biological and environmental processes on stromatolite formation. The regional distribution of stromatolites in the palaeoenvironment suggests a biological response to variations in water depth, sediment influx and hydrothermal activity with stromatolite formation favoured by relatively 'normal' shallow marine environments with low clastic/chemical sedimentation rates and no direct input from high temperature hydrothermal systems. The lithology, structure and fabrics of the stromatolites, and their close association with abundant evaporite crystal pseudomorphs, indicate that evaporitic precipitation was probably the dominant non-biological process that contributed to stromatolite formation. The study supports a biological interpretation for the origin of the stromatolites, and reveals compelling evidence for the conditions that favoured biological activity on the early Earth and formation of macroscopic biosignatures that could be preserved for most of Earth's history. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The new dataset of the carbon and oxygen stable isotope values across the sedimentary sequence of the Changhsingian Stage at Meishan, south China documents the carbon biogeochemical cycle in detail. The cycle began with storage of organic carbon (Corg), mainly as biogenic carbon dioxide in clathrates, and carbon dioxide from anaeorobic methane oxidation (AMO) in the stratified sea water masses, which is reflected by a rapid increase in the $\delta$13C values. Storage of Corg demanded a large biomass productivity, and thus consumption of a vast amount of carbon dioxide, which would have been associated with climatic oceanic water cooling. Oceanic water cooling and enhanced volcanism is actually reflected by a gradual increase in the $\delta$18O values. The longterm stasis between Corg burial and reburial was then achieved, as reflected by the stable course of the $\delta$13C curve. At the same time, cool water circulation caused a continuous increase in the $\delta$18O values. At the end of the cycle, several factors including earthquakes and other tectonic movements marking the onset of major Siberian volcanism, together with a local temperature increase resulted in a change of ocean circulation, caused mixing of stratified sea water masses. This was followed by destruction of the existing clathrates, degassing of carbon dioxide, oxidation of organic matter, and a rapid decrease in the oceanic $\delta$13C values. Apart from the carbon dioxide that was released to the atmosphere, part of the methane must have been oxidised, creating additional carbon dioxide as well as water vapour. The carbon dioxide and water vapour must have initiated a greenhouse effect and caused thermal stratification of seawater which, in turn, initiated reconstruction of the redox in the Early Triassic. The end of the cycle was associated with the end-Permian mass extinction. The global warming associated with methane release from clathrates led to collapse of terrestrial plants. At the same time, the mixing event brought methane and organic matter for oxidation, which caused massive consumption of oxygen and extinction of the terrestrial fauna. In the marine environment, the mixing event brought water masses rich in carbon dioxide, as well as excess hydrogen ions from anoxic zones, onto shelf areas, causing a collapse of marine biota. The carbon biogeochemical cycle of the Changhsingian indicated by the initial rapid rise, long-term stasis, and final rapid drop in $\delta$13C values, seems to be a rule for a pattern of Phanerozoic $\delta$13C values in sedimentary carbonates. This suggests that a process of methane storage and release may have had a bearing on major geochemical perturbations throughout Earth history. However, methane storage, with or without the association of carbon dioxide and other forms of Corg, and its subsequent release, could have occurred in many different scenarios throughout the Phanerozoic, Therefore, the end of the carbon cycles may be associated with mass extinction only when release of methane is coupled with other phenomena, which is the case with the end-Permian event.},

abstract = {Late Devonian glaciation is well-documented in three Brazilian basins, and newer work has shown a wider extent for this event, reaching Bolivia, Peru, Central African Republic, Niger, and the USA. Physical evidence for this event includes glacial pavements and polymict striated, and faceted clasts as dropstones and within marine resedimented deposits. Late Devonian (Frasnian? and Famennian) onset of Gondwanaland's glaciations resulted in fundamental changes in coeval and later (Mississippian) depositional systems worldwide. Palynomorphs date the more widespread event within the Retispora lepidophyta (miospore) palynozone, which often occurs with the marine acritarch Umbellasphaeridium saharicum. This initial glaciation continued into earliest Carboniferous (Tournaisian) time. There were several consequences from the short-term glacioeustasy. In North America, central Europe and southern China there is a coeval sea-level fall that exhumed and eroded carbonate platforms, deposited siliciclastics, and generated lacunae in the Famennian record. The lowstand resulted in extensive carbonate breccias, shallow-water deposits and evaporites in western U.S.A. Lowstand clastic wedges were deposited in a regression (eastern U.S.A.) with widespread black shales. In Moravia, Famennian siliciclastic influx increased as a result of subaerial weathering in newly-emergent highs that resulted from sea-level drop. Partial sea-level drops were also manifested by ferruginous oolites, which developed in nearshore environments and were subsequently dispersed down adjacent slopes by storm resedimentation. In southern China, aggradation, siliciclastic influx, reflux-dolomitization from evaporation, and shallow-water carbonate resulted from Famennian sea-level fall. The coupling of glacial and lowstand events explains the sudden appearance of shallow-marine, as well as subaerially-affected features after the Frasnian transgression that breached the North American craton. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, morphological web-like structures typical for microbial mats, as well as the recognition of 2{\^{I}}±-methylhopanes and monomethyl-alkane cyanobacteria biomarkers is evidenced of microbial activity after the global Frasnian/Famennian (F/F) extinction event. The presence of cyanobacterial mats also suggests suboxic to oxic environments and at the same time photic bottom water conditions. However, isorenieratane and its derivatives were detected in almost all samples. The presence of this well-known biomarker of green sulfur bacteria implies that euxinic conditions were present in the upper part of the water column at least intermittently or that temporal euxinia occurred in the water column. Presence of euxinic conditions is confirmed by the occurrence of small-sized pyrite framboids which were particularly dominant in the lower part of the section. The shift towards low $\delta$13C values in both micritic limestones and in sedimentary organic matter seen at the beginning of the period of diminished photic zone, might reflect an influx of newly respired CO2 to surface waters, caused by enhanced respiration at depth after the F/F transition in the Ch{\"{A}}™ciny-Zbrza basin.},

abstract = {Palynomorph distribution in Euramerica and western Gondwana, from the Latest Givetian to the Latest Famennian, may be explained, to some extent, by climatic changes. Detailed miospore stratigraphy dates accurately the successive steps of these changes. Interpretation is built on three postulates which are discussed: Euramerica at slightly lower latitudes than generally accepted by most paleomagnetic reconstructions: a conodont time-scale accepted as the most used available subdivision of time; and Late Devonian sea-level fluctuations mainly governed by glacio-eustasy. The Frasnian-Famennian timescale is also evaluated. The comparison, based on conodont correlations, between Givetian and most of the Frasnian miospore assemblages from, respectively, northern and southern Euramerica demonstrates a high taxonomic diversity in the equatorial belt and much difference between supposed equatorial and (sub) tropical vegetations. On the contrary, a similar vegetation pattern and therefore probably compatible climatic conditions were present from tropical to subpolar areas. A rather hot climate culminated during the Latest Frasnian when equatorial miospore assemblages reached their maximum width. The miospore diversity shows also a rather clear global Late Frasnian minimum which is also recorded during the Early and Middle Famennian but only in low latitude regions while, in high latitude, very cold climates without perennial snow may explain the scarcity of miospores and so of vegetation. The Early and Middle Famennian conspicuous latitudinal gradient of the vegetation seems to attenuate towards the Late and Latest Famennian but this might be above all the result of the development, of cosmopolitan coastal lowland vegetations (downstream swamps) depending more on the moisture and equable local microclimates than on the probably adverse climates of distant hinterland areas. During than time, periods of cold climate without perennial snow cover and with rare vegetation may have alternated with less cold but wetter climates, thus giving rise to the development of mountain glaciers in high latitudes and explaining the jerking character of the global major marine regression. In high latitude regions, the development of an ice cap reaching sea level is only recorded by the end of the Latest Famennian, immediately below the DCB but even if glacial evidence are not known at near the FFB, a short (0.1 Ma?) glaciation seems the best reasonable explanation of the major eustatic fall following the Kellwasser Event. The sudden growth and decay of a hypothetical. Earliest Famennian ice sheet can be explained by the reduction and later, increase in greenhouse capacity of the atmosphere. These changes in the atmospheric CO2 might have provoked changes in the mode of ocean-atmosphere operation. It may also be partly controlled by a volcanic paroxysm and/or bolide impacts. The Hony microtektites represent the best known evidence of the impact of extraterrestrial bodies on Earth corresponding to the UKW and they are immediately followed by a regression suggested by the quantitative analysis of acritarch assemblages. In the paleo-tropical Late Famennian a peat-forming vascular plant community occurs for the first time and makes possible quantitative palynology of autochthonous sediments allowing the recognition of different swamp and near-swamp characteristic miospores. The early Latest Famennian starts with a widespread transgression which could correspond to the melting phases of the hypothetical Late Famennian mountain glaciers. During the end-Famennian the coastal lowland vegetation has a worldwide distribution from sub-polar to equatorial regions. The climate has become less cold in high latitudes but wetter than before probably because the midlatitude cyclonic activity allows sufficient polar transportation of moisture to form large snow cover. Extensive coastal glaciers developed in different Bolivian and Brazilian basins, well dated by miospores. Rapid climatic changes characterize the onset of glaciation. The cyclic nature of climate allowed even intertropical marine faunas to reach occasionally the subpolar regions. For the plant kingdom, the crisis which follows the Hangenberg Event was more severe than the Late Frasnian Crisis. {\textcopyright} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Oxygen isotope ratios of well-preserved brachiopod calcite and conodont apatite were used to reconstruct the palaeotemperature history of the Middle and Late Devonian. By assuming an oxygen isotopic composition of –1permil V-SMOW for Devonian seawater, the oxygen isotope values of Eifelian and early Givetian brachiopods and conodonts give average palaeotemperatures ranging from 22 to 25 °C. Late Givetian and Frasnian palaeotemperatures calculated from delta18O values of conodont apatite are close to 25 °C in the early Frasnian and increase to 32 °C in the latest Frasnian and early Famennian. Oxygen isotope ratios of late Givetian and Frasnian brachiopods are significantly lower than equilibrium values calculated from conodont apatite delta18O values and give unrealistically warm temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 °C. Diagenetic recrystallization of shell calcite, different habitats of conodonts and brachiopods, as well as non-equilibrium fractionation processes during the precipitation of brachiopod calcite cannot explain the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite. Moreover, the 18O depletion of brachiopod calcite with respect to equilibrium delta18O values calculated from conodont apatite is too large to be explained by a change in seawater pH that might have influenced the oxygen isotopic composition of brachiopod calcite. The realistic palaeotemperatures derived from delta18O apatite may suggest that biogenic apatite records the oxygen isotopic composition and palaeotemperature of Palaeozoic oceans more faithfully than brachiopod calcite, and do not support the hypothesis that the 18O /16O ratio of Devonian seawater was significantly different from that of the modern ocean.},

abstract = {Profiles of carbon isotopes were studied in marine limestones of Late Permian and Early Triassic age of the Tethyan region from 20 sections in Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Armenian SSR, Iran, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and China. The Upper Permian sections continue the high positive values of delta13C previously found in Upper Permian basins in NW Europe and western USA. In the more complete sections of Tethys it can now be demonstrated that the values of delta13C drop from the Murgabian to the Dzhulfian Stages of the Upper Permian, then sharply to values near zero during the last two biozones of the Dorashamian. These levels of delta13C sample the Tethys Sea and the world ocean, and equal values from deep-water sediments at Salamis Greece indicate that they apply to the whole water column. We hypothesize that the high values of delta13C are a consequence of Late Paleozoic storage of organic carbon, and that the declines represent an episodic cessation of this organic deposition, and partial oxidation of the organic reservoir, extending over a period of several million years. The carbon isotope profile may reflect parallel complexity in the pattern of mass extinction in Late Permian time.},

abstract = {Assemblages of acritarchs, prasinophytes, and miospores were recovered from the uppermost Iquiri and lower portion of the Itacua formations in southeast Bolivia. Analysis of the diverse and somewhat abundant well-preserved palynomorph assemblage indicates a Late Devonian (late Famennian) age for both formations, and further subdivision in ascending stratigraphic order into the ?VCo, LL, LE, and LN miospore biozones of Western Europe. The presence of age-diagnostic miospore taxa from South America and North America indicates contemporaneous glaciation events between these two regions. The results from close sampling of the diamictite facies of the Itacua Formation at the Bermejo West section, Bolivia, correlate the latest Famennian spore inceptions used to define the Euramerica miospore biozone sequence (LL, LE, and LN zones). The Itacua Formation diamictite sequence examined is relatively thin compared to other diamictite sequences in Bolivia. Furthermore, the miospore biozones represent an estimated duration of three million years, whereas orbitally-forced glacial-interglacial events (e.g., Ruddiman, 2001) are of the Milankovitch frequency range of between 20,000 and 400,000. years. Therefore, it seems most likely that a number of glacial/interglacial events are represented, rather than a single glacial episode. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Korte2010a,
abstract = {The Palaeozoic-Mesozoic transition is marked by distinct perturbations in the global carbon cycle resulting in a prominent negative carbon-isotope excursion at the Permian-Triassic (P-T) boundary, well known from a plethora of marine and continental sediments. Potential causes for this negative delta(13)C trend (and their links to the latest Permian mass extinction) have been intensively debated in the literature. In order to draw conclusions regarding causation, a general delta(13)C curve was defined after consideration of all available datasets and with due reference to the biostratigraphic background. The most important features of the P-T carbon-isotope trend are the following: the 4-7 parts per thousand delta(13)C decline (lasting similar to 500,000 years) is gradual and began in the Changhsingian at the stratigraphic level of the C. bachmanni Zone. The decreasing trend is interrupted by a short-term positive event that starts at about the latest Permian low-latitude marine main extinction event horizon (=EH), indicating that the extinction itself cannot have caused the negative carbon-isotope excursion. After this short-term positive excursion, the delta(13)C decline continues to a first minimum at about the P-T boundary. A subsequent slight increase is followed by a second (occasionally two-peaked) minimum in the lower (and middle) I. isarcica Zone. The negative carbon-isotope excursion was most likely a consequence of a combination of different causes that may include: (1) direct and indirect effects of the Siberian Trap and contemporaneous volcanism and (2) anoxic deep waters occasionally reaching very shallow sea levels. A sudden release of isotopically light methane from oceanic sediment piles or permafrost soils as a source for the negative carbon-isotope trend is questionable at least for the time span a little below the EH and somewhat above the P-T boundary.
